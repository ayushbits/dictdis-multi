AII@@ B started its financing operations in January 2016 .
As developing countries , we share similar challenges .
Invest@@ ments by AII@@ B in sustainable infrastructure can impact the lives of bil@@ lions of people .
Regional multi-@@ l@@ ater@@ alism through institutions such as AII@@ B can play a central role in helping to raise resources .
This is a good beginning .
India is one of the most invest@@ or-@@ friendly economies in the world .
Investors look for growth and mac@@ ro-@@ economic stability .
They want political stability and a sup@@ por@@ tive regulatory framework to ensure protection of their investment .
From the point of larger scale of operations and higher value addition , an investor is also attracted by a large domestic market size , availability of skilled labour and good physical infrastructure .

As per U@@ NC@@ T@@ AD 's World Investment Report , India continues to be one of the top FDI destinations in the world .
From the point of a foreign investor , India counts as an extremely low risk political economy .
The Government has taken a number of steps to boost investment .
These and other changes have been noticed by the global fraternity .
India has jumped 42 places in three years to enter the top hundred in the World Bank 's Ease of Doing Business Report 2018 .
The size and growth of the Indian market hold much potential .
India 's per capita income has doubled in the last ten years .
We have over 300 million middle class consumers .
This number is expected to double in the next ten years .
The size and scale of requirement in India gives the added advantage of economies of scale for investors .
For example , the housing programme in India targets ten million houses in urban areas .
Therefore the use of new technology in house construction would have added advantage , if tried in India .
Another example of scale would be the Renewable Energy Programme in India .
We have set a target to construct capacity of 175 G@@ ig@@ a Wat@@ t of renewable energy by the year 2022 .
We have added more capacity to renewable energy than conventional energy in 2017 .
We are also making collaborative efforts to mainstream solar energy in the form of an International Solar Alliance .
The founding conference of the Alliance was held in New Delhi earlier this year .
The Alliance aims at a solar capacity of 1000 G@@ ig@@ a Wat@@ t with an investment of one trillion US Doll@@ ars by 2030 .
India is working on e-@@ mobility .
We will be hosting a global mobility conference this year .
I hope that this will help us in moving forward .

Dedic@@ ated Fre@@ ight Cor@@ ridors are being developed to miti@@ gate the cong@@ estion of our railway network .

Through the U@@ M@@ AN@@ G App , more than 100 public services have been made available to the citizens through their mobile phone .
We aim to provide every poor and hom@@ eless household a house with toilet , water and electricity by the year 2022 .
We are also looking at various strategies for effective waste management .
This will provide a benefit cover of over 7@@ 000 dollars annually to more than 100 million poor and vulnerable families .
The resulting expansion of health care facilities will lead to the creation of a large number of jobs .
This will also promote the production of high quality medicines , consu@@ m@@ ables and other medical technology equipment .
I see great un@@ t@@ apped potential in this for investors .
The Indian story of economic res@@ urg@@ ence closely mir@@ r@@ ors that of many other parts of Asia .
Now , the continent finds itself at the centre of global economic activity .

But if something comes from outside those few things you had touched upon ; a question comes which is outside the bun@@ ch of selected questions that you had prepared ; you will be find yourself sli@@ pping to the rock bottom .

It is a huge psychological battle .

Of course , it is quite possible that my words this morning will act as a relax@@ ant for you .

The MoU covers the following areas of cooperation :

Over the last twenty years , more than eight hundred and fifty thousand people died from disasters in the Asi@@ a-@@ Pacific .
Seven of the top ten countries in the world in terms of number of deaths due to disasters are in the Asi@@ a-@@ Pacific .
It was dist@@ ressing to see the suffering of the affected people .
But I was also inspired by their courage , ing@@ en@@ uity and resolve to recover from the disaster .
In my experience , the more we reli@@ ed on people 's own leadership , the better were the outcomes .
We need to support such initiative and leadership through policies and practices .
After the Indian Ocean T@@ sunami of 2004 , the five worst affected countries brought in new laws for disaster risk management .
In a couple of days , we will observe the first International T@@ sunami Awareness Day .
The same goes for improvements in cyclone early warning .
In India , if we compare the impact of cyclone events in 1999 and 2013 , we can see the progress we have made .
It is now recognized as a global best practice .
There are d@@ aun@@ ting challenges ahead .
If we do not manage this growth , in terms of both planning and execution , the risk of economic and human losses from disasters will be higher than ever before .
In this context , let me out@@ line a ten@@ -@@ point agenda for renew@@ ing our efforts towards disaster risk reduction :
First , all development sectors must im@@ bi@@ be the principles of disaster risk management .
Over the next couple of decades , most of the new infrastructure in the world will come up in our region .
We need to ensure that we build it to best available standards of disaster safety .
India will work with other partner countries and stakeholders to build a coalition or centre for promoting disaster resili@@ ent infrastructure in the region .
Currently , in most countries of the region , penetr@@ ation of insurance is limited to only middle and up@@ per-@@ middle income groups .
The Jan Dhan Yojana has brought millions of people into the banking system .
The Sur@@ ak@@ sha B@@ ima Yojana provides risk insurance to millions who need it the most .
They also have unique strengths and insi@@ ghts .
Four@@ th , invest in risk m@@ apping globally .
For m@@ apping risks related to haz@@ ards such as earth@@ qu@@ akes we have widely accepted standards and parameters .
As part of this network , different universities could speci@@ alize in multi-@@ disciplinary research on disaster issues most relevant to them .
Social media is transforming disaster response .
It is helping response agencies in quickly organizing themselves , and enabling citizens to connect more easily with authorities .
In disaster after disaster , affected people are using social media to help each other .
Speci@@ fic actions have to be designed and implemented locally .
For example , if a local fire service visits one school in its area every week , it would sensi@@ tiz@@ e thousands of children over a period of one year .
And finally , bring about greater co@@ hes@@ ion in international response to disasters .
In the after@@ math of a disaster , disaster respon@@ ders pour in from all over the world .
In our effort to build disaster resili@@ ence , we stand shoulder to shoulder with all the nations of the region .
Regional and International Cooperation has an important role in providing an added push to our efforts .
Last year in November , India organized the first-ever South Asian Annual Disaster Management Exercise .
In the spirit of regional cooperation , India will soon launch the South Asia Satellite .
As we implement the S@@ end@@ ai Framework , we would welcome new opportunities for regional and international collaboration .
The PM added , " The Government is constantly working to create a conducive environment for business in the country .
It is because of such efforts that we have improved significantly on the Ease of Doing Business rankings from 142 to 77 . "
The PM added , " It is our constant endeavour to simpl@@ ify procedures for small entrepreneurs .
We are cle@@ aring loans up to Rs one crore in 59 minutes . "
I thanked all the parties on that day .
When all parties work together in the larger nation interest , positive outcomes and results emerge .
Besides , the government 's thinking would also be reflected .
I expect a good , healthy debate with excellent contribution from all the political parties ..
I am happy to be a part of this aug@@ ust gathering of global leaders and decision makers of the food processing sector .
India is also the world 's biggest milk producer .
Our trade sy@@ ner@@ g@@ ies with Europe and South East Asia through the Sp@@ ice Rou@@ te are well known .
Food processing is a way of life in India .
India is also rapidly progressing on the Global Innovation Index , Global Log@@ istics Index and Global Com@@ peti@@ tiveness Index .
Star@@ ting a new business in India is now easier than ever before .
Proc@@ e@@ dures for obtaining cle@@ arances from various agencies have been simpl@@ ified .
I now turn specifically , to food processing .
The Government has undertaken a range of transform@@ ational initiatives .
India is now the most preferred investment destination in this sector .
A single-@@ window facil@@ itation cell provides hand@@ holding for foreign investors .
Such is the scale of opportunity that is waiting to be t@@ apped .
The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India has been engaged in ensuring that processed food made in India , matches global quality standards .
Through these food parks , we aim to link ag@@ ro-@@ processing clusters with key production centres .
To improve last mile delivery , we are improving governance , by increasing access to digital technology .
Hon@@ ey is nature 's gift to mankind .
Currently , we rank sixth in the production and export of honey .
India is now ri@@ pe , for a sweet revolution .
India contributes over six per cent of global fish production .
We are the world 's second largest ex@@ porter of sh@@ ri@@ m@@ ps .
India exports fish and fisheries products to about 95 countries .
We aim to make a big le@@ ap in the ocean economy through the blue revolution .
They can also with@@ stand adverse ag@@ ro-@@ clim@@ atic conditions .
They can be called " nutrition rich and climate smart " crops .

I am confident that World Food India will help us take some concrete steps in this direction .

Friends , till recently Indian import@@ ers had to go abroad to view and purchase rough di@@ am@@ onds .

Earlier only e@@ ighty to nin@@ ety big merch@@ ants used to get access to global rough di@@ am@@ onds by travelling to Belgium , Africa and Israel .
Now , about three thousand small and medium merch@@ ants have this privilege through the new Special No@@ tified Zone .
Skill India aims to ensure that new entr@@ ants to the work force have the necessary skills to contribute to the economy of the 21st century .
The g@@ ems and jewellery sector emplo@@ ys 4.@@ 6 million people .
Out of this , one million people are in the di@@ am@@ onds industry alone .
Thus the g@@ ems and jewellery sector is a prime example of the potential of ' Make In India ' and Skill India .
Today , we have with us Ministers from several African countries .
This does not do justice to our rich experience and abundant design talent .
Even hair dres@@ s@@ ers change hair style fashi@@ ons of their cli@@ ents .
We live in an era where di@@ am@@ onds are used in spectac@@ les , wat@@ ches and p@@ ens .
There was a time in the past where some products from India had achieved a global reputation .
I hope the industry is in constant touch with them .
What goals is the g@@ ems and jewellery industry setting for itself by that date ?
We can certainly consider them if they are in the interest of our country .
