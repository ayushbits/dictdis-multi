This is called a chemical ' s p@@ H . You can make an indic@@ ator using red c@@ ab@@ bage juice .
The c@@ ab@@ bage juice changes color depending on how aci@@ dic or basic ( al@@ k@@ al@@ ine ) the chemical is .
The p@@ H level is indicated by the amount of Hydro@@ gen ( the H in p@@ H ) ions in the tested chemical .
Hydro@@ gen ions are prot@@ ons that had their electr@@ ons stri@@ pped off them ( since Hydro@@ gen at@@ oms consist of one prot@@ on and one electr@@ on ) .

The cities of Har@@ appa and Moh@@ enjo@@ -@@ dar@@ o had a fl@@ ush toilet in almost every house , attached to a s@@ oph@@ istic@@ ated sewage system .
Rem@@ ains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Min@@ o@@ an cities of C@@ ret@@ e and San@@ tor@@ ini in Greece .
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt , Per@@ sia and China . In Roman civilization , toilets were sometimes part of public bath houses where men and women were together in mixed company .
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away , you are using a satellite .
The satellite in space gets the call and then reflects it back down , almost inst@@ antly .
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket . Scientists use tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es in space because the Earth ' s atmosphere distor@@ ts some of our light and view .
It takes a giant rocket over a 100 feet high to put a satellite or tel@@ es@@ cope in space .
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways . The biggest thing that the wheel has done for us is given us much easier and faster transportation .
It has brought us the train , the car , and many other transportation devices .
Under them are more medium sized c@@ ats that eat medium sized prey ranging from rab@@ b@@ its to ant@@ el@@ op@@ es and de@@ er .
Finally , there are many small c@@ ats ( including loose pet c@@ ats ) that eat the far more numerous small prey like insects , ro@@ dents , liz@@ ards , and birds .
The secret to their success is the concept of the nic@@ he , a special job each c@@ at holds that keeps it from competing with others .
L@@ ions are the most social c@@ ats , living in large groups called pri@@ des .
Pri@@ des are made up of one to three related adult males , along with as many as thirty females and cu@@ bs .
The females are usually closely related to each other , being a large family of sisters and daughters .
L@@ ion pri@@ des act much like pac@@ ks of w@@ ol@@ ves or dogs , animals sur@@ pris@@ ingly similar to lions ( but not other big c@@ ats ) in behavior , and also very deadly to their prey .
A well r@@ ounded athlete , the tiger can clim@@ b ( though not well ) , swi@@ m , le@@ ap great dist@@ ances and pull with five times the force of a strong human .
The tiger is in the same group ( Gen@@ us Pan@@ th@@ era ) as lions , le@@ op@@ ards , and j@@ agu@@ ars . These four c@@ ats are the only ones who can ro@@ ar .
The tiger ' s ro@@ ar is not like the full-@@ vo@@ iced ro@@ ar of a lion , but more like a sentence of sn@@ arly , shouted words .
O@@ cel@@ ots like to eat small animals . They will catch mon@@ keys , sn@@ akes , ro@@ dents and birds if they can . Almost all of the animals that the oc@@ el@@ ot hun@@ ts are far smaller than it is .
Scientists think that oc@@ el@@ ots follow and find animals to eat ( prey ) by sm@@ ell , s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ing for where they ' ve been on the ground .
They can see very well in the dark with night vision , and move very ste@@ al@@ th@@ ily , too . O@@ cel@@ ots hunt their prey by bl@@ ending in with their surr@@ ound@@ ings then p@@ oun@@ cing on their prey .
When a small group of living things ( a small population ) gets separated from the main population that they came from ( like if they move over a mountain range or a river , or if they move to a new island so that they can ' t easily move back ) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before .
This new environment has different resources and different competi@@ tors , so the new population will need different features or adap@@ tations to be a strong competi@@ tor than what they had needed before .
The original population hasn ' t changed at all , they still need the same adap@@ tations as before .
Over time , as the new population begins to adap@@ t to their new environment , they start to look less and less like the other population .
Ev@@ ent@@ ually , after thousands or even millions of years , the two populations will look so different that they can ' t be called the same species .
We call this process speci@@ ation , which just means the formation of new species . Speci@@ ation is an un@@ avo@@ idable consequence and a very important part of evolution .
Pl@@ ants make oxygen which humans bre@@ a@@ the , and they take in car@@ b@@ on-@@ dioxide which humans exha@@ le ( that is , bre@@ a@@ the out ) .
Pl@@ ants make their food from the sun by phot@@ osy@@ n@@ thesis . They also provide sha@@ de .
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants . Most foods that we eat are plants . Without plants , animals could not survive .
Mos@@ as@@ aur@@ us was the apex pre@@ d@@ ator of its time , so it feared nothing , except other mos@@ as@@ aur@@ s .
Its long jaw@@ s were stud@@ ded with more than 70 ra@@ z@@ or-@@ sharp teeth , along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth , meaning that there was no escape for anything that crossed its path .
We don ' t know for sure , but it may have had a for@@ ked tongue . Its diet included tur@@ t@@ les , large fish , other mos@@ as@@ aur@@ s , and it may even have been a c@@ ann@@ i@@ bal .
It also attacked anything that entered the water ; even a giant d@@ in@@ os@@ aur such as T. re@@ x would be no match for it .
While most of their food would be familiar to us , Romans did have their share of strange or unusual fe@@ ast items , including wild bo@@ ar , peac@@ ock , sn@@ ails , and a type of ro@@ dent called a d@@ orm@@ ouse
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs , the rich men liked to have ban@@ qu@@ ets together where they would l@@ oun@@ ge on their sides while they ate their meals .
An@@ ci@@ ent Roman meals couldn ' t have included foods that came to Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries .
For instance , they didn ' t have cor@@ n , nor tom@@ atoes , nor pot@@ atoes , nor c@@ oc@@ oa , and no ancient Roman ever t@@ asted a tur@@ key .
The Babyl@@ on@@ ians built each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the home of the god .
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to attend to the needs of the gods through ceremon@@ ies and festivals .
Each temple had an open temple cour@@ ty@@ ard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter .
Sometimes special py@@ ram@@ id shaped tow@@ ers , called z@@ ig@@ gur@@ ats , were built to be a part of the temples .
The top of the tower was special sanctuary for the god .
In the warm climate of the Middle East , the house was not so important .
Most of the life of the Hebrew family happened in the open air .
Women did the cooking in the yard ; stores were just open counters looking into the street . Stone was used for building houses .
There were no large forests in the land of Can@@ aan , so wood was extremely expensive .
Green@@ land was settled spar@@ s@@ ely . In the Nor@@ se s@@ ag@@ as they say that E@@ ri@@ k the Red was ex@@ iled from I@@ cel@@ and for murder , and when travelling further west , found Green@@ land and named it Green@@ land .
But regardless of his discovery , E@@ sk@@ im@@ o tribes were already living there at the time .
Though each country was ' Sc@@ and@@ in@@ av@@ ian ' , there were many differences between the people , kings , customs and history of Denmark , Sweden , Norway and I@@ cel@@ and .
If you have watched the movie National Treas@@ ure , you may think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence .
However , that is not true . Although there is something written on the back of the document , it is not a treasure map .
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words " Orig@@ inal Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 17@@ 76 . " The text appears on the bottom of the document , up@@ side down .
While no one knows for certain who wrote it , it is known that early in its life , the large par@@ ch@@ ment document ( it measures 29 ¾ in@@ ches by 24 ½ in@@ ches ) was rolled up for storage .
So , it is likely that the no@@ tation was added simply as a label .
The D-@@ Day land@@ ings and the following batt@@ les had fre@@ ed the north of France , but the south still wasn ' t free .
It was ruled by the " Vic@@ h@@ y " French . These were French people who had made peace with the Ger@@ mans in 1940 and worked with the inv@@ aders instead of fighting them .
On 15 August 1940 , the Al@@ lies inv@@ aded southern France , the inv@@ asion was called " Operation Dr@@ ag@@ oon . "
In just two weeks the Americans and Free French forces had liber@@ ated southern France and were turning towards Germany .
A civilization is a sing@@ ular culture shared by a significant large group of people who live and work co-@@ oper@@ atively , a society .
The word civilization comes from the Latin civil@@ is , meaning civil , related to the Latin civ@@ is , meaning citizen , and civ@@ it@@ as , meaning city or c@@ ity-@@ state , and that also somehow defin@@ es the size of the society .
C@@ ity-@@ states are the prec@@ urs@@ ors of nations . A civil@@ iz@@ ational culture impl@@ ies the passing on of knowledge across several generations , a l@@ ing@@ ering cultural foot@@ print and fair dissemination .
Minor cultures often van@@ ish without leaving relevant historic evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civil@@ izations .
During the Rev@@ ol@@ utionary War , the thir@@ teen states first formed a weak central government - with the Congress being its only component - under the Arti@@ cles of Confederation .
Congress lac@@ ked any power to impose taxes , and , because there was no national executive or judiciary , it reli@@ ed on state authorities , who were often un@@ cooperative , to en@@ force all its acts .
It also had no authority to over@@ ride tax laws and tariffs between states .
The Arti@@ cles required unanim@@ ous consent from all the states before they could be amended and states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often ab@@ sent .
Italy ' s national football , along with German national football team is the second most successful team in the world and were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006 .

Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions , with It@@ ali@@ ans competing in international games and Olympic events .
Jap@@ ans holds nearly 7,000 islands ( the biggest being Hon@@ shu ) , making Japan the 7th largest island in the world !
Due to the cluster / group of islands Japan has , Japan is often referred to , on a geographical stance , as an " archi@@ pel@@ ago "
Taiwan beginning start way back in 15th century where European s@@ ail@@ ors passing by record the island ' s name as Il@@ ha For@@ mos@@ a , or beautiful island .
In 16@@ 24 , Dutch East India Company establ@@ ishes a base in sou@@ th@@ western Taiwan , initi@@ ating a transformation in abor@@ ig@@ inal grain production practices and emplo@@ ying Chinese lab@@ ore@@ rs to work on its rice and sugar plant@@ ations .
In 16@@ 83 , Q@@ ing dynasty ( 16@@ 4@@ 4-@@ 19@@ 12 ) forces take control of Taiwan ' s western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan as a province of the Q@@ ing Empire in 18@@ 85 .
In 18@@ 95 , after defeat in the First Sin@@ o-@@ Japanese War ( 18@@ 9@@ 4-@@ 18@@ 95 ) , the Q@@ ing government signs the Treaty of Shi@@ mon@@ os@@ ek@@ i , by which it c@@ ed@@ es sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan , which rules the island until 1945 .
Mach@@ u Pic@@ ch@@ u consist of three main structures , namely In@@ ti@@ hu@@ at@@ ana , the Temple of the Sun , and the R@@ oom of the Three Windows .
Most of the buildings on the ed@@ ges of the complex have been re@@ built in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared .
By 1976 , thirty percent of Mach@@ u Pic@@ ch@@ u had been restored and restoration continues till today .
For example , the most common still image photo@@ graphy format in the world is 35@@ mm , which was the dominant film size at the close of the anal@@ og film era .
It is still produced today , but more import@@ antly its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats .
The 35@@ mm format is actually , somewhat conf@@ us@@ ingly , 36@@ mm in width by 24@@ mm in height .
The aspect ratio of this format ( divid@@ ing by twelve to obtain the simpl@@ est whol@@ e-@@ number ratio ) is therefore said to be 3 : 2 .
Many common formats ( A@@ PS family of formats , for example ) are equal to or closely approxim@@ ate this aspect ratio .
The much-@@ abused and of@@ ten@@ -@@ ridic@@ ul@@ ed rule of thir@@ ds is a simple guid@@ eline creating dynam@@ ism while keeping a measure of order in an image .
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the inter@@ section of lines divid@@ ing the image into thir@@ ds ver@@ tically and horiz@@ on@@ tally ( see example ) .
During this period of European history , the Catholic Church , which had become rich and powerful , came under scrutiny .
For over a thousand years the Christian religion had bound European states together despite differences in language and customs . I
Its all-@@ per@@ v@@ ading power affected everyone from king to comm@@ oner .
One of the main Christian ten@@ ets is that wealth should be used to all@@ ev@@ i@@ ate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church are there specifically for that reason .
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this ten@@ et was being met .
Soon after the outbreak of hos@@ ti@@ li@@ ties , Britain initiated a naval block@@ ade of Germany .
The strategy proved effective , cutting off vital military and civilian supplies , although this block@@ ade violated generally accepted international law co@@ di@@ fied by several international agreements of the past two centuries .
Britain min@@ ed international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean , causing danger to even neutral ships .
Since there was limited response to this tac@@ tic , Germany expected a similar response to its un@@ restricted sub@@ marine warfare .
During the 19@@ 20@@ s , the prevailing at@@ titudes of most citizens and nations was that of pac@@ if@@ ism and isolation .
After seeing the hor@@ r@@ ors and atrocities of war during World War I , nations desired to avoid such a situation again in the future .
In 18@@ 84 , T@@ es@@ la moved to the United States of America to accept a job with the E@@ dis@@ on Company in New York City .
He arrived in the US with 4 c@@ ents to his name , a book of poetry , and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bat@@ ch@@ el@@ or ( his manager in his previous job ) to Thomas E@@ dis@@ on .
An@@ ci@@ ent China had a unique way of showing different time periods ; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinc@@ tive dynasty .
Also between each dynasty was an un@@ stable age of divided provinces . The be@@ st-@@ known of these periods was the Three King@@ dom@@ s e@@ po@@ ch taking place for 60 years between the H@@ an and the J@@ in D@@ yn@@ asty .
During these periods fierce warfare took place between many no@@ bles fighting for the throne .
The Three King@@ dom@@ s was one of the bl@@ oo@@ di@@ est eras in An@@ ci@@ ent China ' s history thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat in the grand palace at Xi ' an .
There are a lot of social and political effects such as the use of metric system , a shift from absol@@ u@@ tism to re@@ public@@ an@@ ism , nationalism and the belief the country belongs to the people not to one sole ruler .
Also after the Revolution occup@@ ations were open to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed .
S@@ ame goes for the military because instead of army rankings being based on class they were now based on c@@ ail@@ ab@@ er .
The French Revolution also inspired many other repres@@ sed working class people of other country ' s to began their own revol@@ utions .
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this m@@ und@@ ane life . He used to frequent a cave that became known as " H@@ ira ' " on the Moun@@ tain of " N@@ oor " ( light ) for contem@@ pl@@ ation .
he cave itself , which survived the times , gives a very viv@@ id image of Muhammad ' s spiritual incl@@ inations .
R@@ esting on the top of one of the mountains north of Mec@@ ca , the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world .
In fact , it is not easy to find at all even if one knew it existed . Once inside the cave , it is a total isolation .
Nothing can be seen other than the clear , beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains . Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave .
The Great Py@@ ram@@ id at G@@ iz@@ a is the only one of the seven won@@ ders that is still standing today .
Buil@@ t by the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans in the third century B@@ CE , the Great Py@@ ram@@ id is one of many large py@@ ram@@ id structures built to honor dead Pharaoh .
The G@@ iz@@ a Pl@@ ate@@ au , or " G@@ iz@@ a N@@ ec@@ ro@@ pol@@ is " in the Egyptian Valley of the De@@ ad contains several py@@ ram@@ ids ( of which the great py@@ ram@@ id is the largest ) , several small tom@@ bs , several temples , and the great S@@ ph@@ in@@ x .
The great py@@ ram@@ id was created to honor the Pharaoh K@@ hu@@ f@@ u , and many of the smaller py@@ ram@@ ids , tom@@ bs , and temples were built to honor K@@ hu@@ f@@ u ' s wives and family members .
The " up bow " mark looks like a V and the " down bow mark " like a st@@ a@@ ple or a square missing its bottom side .
Up means you should start at the ti@@ p and push the bow , and down means you should start at the fro@@ g ( which is where your hand is holding the bow ) and pull the bow .
An up@@ -@@ bow usually gener@@ ates a sof@@ ter sound , while a down@@ -@@ bow is stronger and more asser@@ tive .
Fe@@ el free to pen@@ cil in your own marks , but remember the printed bow@@ ing marks are there for a musical reason , so they should usually be respected .
The terri@@ fied King Lou@@ is X@@ VI , Queen Mari@@ e An@@ to@@ in@@ ette their two young children ( 11 year old Mari@@ e The@@ res@@ e and four year old Lou@@ is@@ -@@ Charles ) and the King ' s sister , Mad@@ am Eliz@@ abe@@ th , on the 6th October 17@@ 89 were forced back to Paris from Ver@@ s@@ ail@@ les by a mob of market women .
In a car@@ riage , they trav@@ eled back to Paris surrounded by a mob of people scre@@ aming and shou@@ ting threats against the King and Queen .
The mob of people forced the King And Queen to have their car@@ riage windows wide open .
At one point a member of the mob w@@ aved the head of a royal guard killed at Ver@@ s@@ ail@@ les in front of the terri@@ fied Queen .
The war exp@@ end@@ itu@@ res of U.S. imperi@@ alism in the con@@ quest of the Philippines were paid for by the Fil@@ ip@@ ino people themselves .
They were comp@@ elled to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to de@@ fray a major part of the exp@@ end@@ itu@@ res and the interest on bonds flo@@ ated in the name of the Philipp@@ ine government through the W@@ all Street banking houses .
Of course , the super@@ profits derived from the pro@@ trac@@ ted exploitation of the Fil@@ ip@@ ino people would constitute the basic gains of U.S. imperi@@ alism .
To understand the Tem@@ pl@@ ars one must understand the context that promp@@ ted the creation of the order .
The age where the events took place is commonly referred as the High Middle A@@ ges the period of European history in the 11th , 12th , and 13th centuries ( AD 10@@ 00@@ -@@ 13@@ 00 ) .
The High Middle A@@ ges were prec@@ eded by the Early Middle A@@ ges and followed by the Late Middle A@@ ges , which by convention ends around 1500 .
Techn@@ ological determin@@ ism is a term that encomp@@ asses a wide range of ideas in practice , from techn@@ olog@@ y-@@ push or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human dest@@ iny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manife@@ station in technology .
Most inter@@ pret@@ ations of technological determin@@ ism share two general ideas : that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence , and that technology in turn has " effects " on societies that are in@@ herent , rather than soci@@ ally condi@@ tioned .
For example , one might say that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads .
However , a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a hand@@ ful of cars , so new methods of production are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership .
M@@ ass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads , which leads to the inv@@ ention of new techniques in healthcare for rep@@ air@@ ing damaged bodies .
Rom@@ an@@ tic@@ ism had a large element of cultural determin@@ ism , drawn from writers such as Go@@ e@@ the , F@@ ich@@ te , and Sch@@ leg@@ el .
In the context of Rom@@ an@@ tic@@ ism , the ge@@ ography mol@@ ded individuals , and over time customs and culture related to that ge@@ ography arose , and these , being in harmony with the place of the society , were better than arbitr@@ arily imposed laws .
In the manner that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world , Const@@ ant@@ in@@ ople was regarded as the fashion capital of fe@@ ud@@ al Europe .
Its renow@@ n for being an ep@@ ic@@ enter of luxury began in about 400 A.@@ D. and la@@ sted up until about 1@@ 100 A.@@ D.
Its status declined during the twel@@ f@@ th century mainly due to the fact that Cr@@ us@@ aders had returned bearing gifts such as sil@@ ks and spices that were valued more than what By@@ z@@ ant@@ ine markets offered .
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of F@@ ashi@@ on Capital from Const@@ ant@@ in@@ ople to Paris was made .
Go@@ th@@ ic style pe@@ aked in the period between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century .
At the beginning dress was heavily influenced by the By@@ z@@ ant@@ ine culture in the east .
However , due to the slow communication channels , styles in the west could lag behind by 25 to 30 year .
towards the end of the Middle A@@ ges western Europe began to develop their own sty@@ le@@ . one of the biggest developments of the time as a result of the cr@@ us@@ ades people began to use but@@ tons to fast@@ en clothing .
Sub@@ sist@@ ence agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of enough food to meet just the needs of the agric@@ ul@@ tur@@ alist and his / her family .
Sub@@ sist@@ ence agriculture is a simple , often organic , system using saved seed native to the ec@@ o@@ region combined with crop ro@@ tation or other relatively simple techniques to max@@ im@@ ize yield .
Histor@@ ically most farmers were engaged in sub@@ sist@@ ence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing nations .
Sub@@ cultures bring together li@@ ke@@ -@@ minded individuals who feel neglected by soci@@ etal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity .
Sub@@ cultures can be distinc@@ tive because of the age , eth@@ n@@ icity , class , location , and / or gender of the members .
The qualities that determine a sub@@ culture as distinct may be lingu@@ istic , a@@ es@@ thetic , religious , political , sexual , geographical , or a combination of factors .
Members of a sub@@ culture often signal their membership through a distinc@@ tive and symbolic use of style , which includes fashi@@ ons , m@@ ann@@ er@@ isms , and arg@@ ot .
One of the most common methods used to illustr@@ ate the importance of soci@@ alization is to draw upon the few unfortunate cases of children who were , through negl@@ ect , mis@@ fortune , or wil@@ ful abuse , not soci@@ alized by adults while they were growing up .
Such children are called " f@@ eral " or wild . Some f@@ eral children have been confined by people ( usually their own parents ) ; in some cases this child aband@@ on@@ ment was due to the parents ' rejection of a child ' s severe intellectual or physical imp@@ air@@ ment .
F@@ eral children may have experienced severe child abuse or tra@@ uma before being abandoned or running away .
Others are alleged to have been brought up by animals ; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own .
When completely brought up by non-@@ human animals , the f@@ eral child exhib@@ its behavi@@ ors ( within physical limits ) almost entirely like those of the particular care@@ -@@ animal , such as its fear of or in@@ difference to humans .
While project based learning should make learning easier and more interesting , sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding goes a step beyond .
Sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not a method of learning but rather an aid that provides support to individuals whom are undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or beginning a new project .
Sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ds can be both virtual and real , in other words , a teacher is a form of sc@@ aff@@ old but so is the little p@@ ap@@ erc@@ li@@ p man in Microsoft Office .
Vir@@ tual Sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ds are intern@@ alized in the software and are meant to question , prompt , and explain procedures that may have been to challenging for the student to handle alone .
Children are placed in Fo@@ ster Care for a wide variety of reasons that range from negl@@ ect , to abuse , and even to ext@@ or@@ tion .
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nur@@ turing , caring , and educational , but they do .
We perce@@ ive the Fo@@ ster Care System to be a safety zone for these children .
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes , loving ca@@ reg@@ iv@@ ers , stable education , and reliable health care .
Fo@@ ster care is supposed to provide all the nec@@ essi@@ ties that were lac@@ king in the home they were previously taken from .
The Internet comb@@ ines elements of both mass and inter@@ personal communication .
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and grati@@ fications approach .
For example , " learning " and " soci@@ alization " are suggested as important motiv@@ ations for Internet use ( James et al . , 1995 ) .
" Personal involvement " and " continuing relationships " were also identified as new motiv@@ ation aspects by E@@ igh@@ me@@ y and Mc@@ C@@ ord ( 1998 ) when they investigated audience reactions to websites .
The use of video recording has led to important disc@@ overies in the interpretation of micro@@ -@@ expressions , fac@@ ial movements which last a few m@@ ill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds .
In particular , it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by interpre@@ ting micro@@ -@@ expressions correctly .
O@@ liver Sac@@ ks , in his paper The President ' s Speech , indicated how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are n@@ evertheless able to assess sin@@ cer@@ ity accur@@ ately .
He even suggests that such abilities in interpre@@ ting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs .
Tw@@ enti@@ eth century research has shown that there are two po@@ ols of genetic vari@@ ation : hidden and expressed .
M@@ utation adds new genetic vari@@ ation , and selection remov@@ es it from the pool of expressed vari@@ ation .
S@@ eg@@ reg@@ ation and re@@ combination sh@@ u@@ ffle vari@@ ation back and forth between the two po@@ ols with each generation .
Out on the sav@@ anna , it is hard for a pri@@ mate with a dig@@ estive system like that of humans to satisfy its am@@ in@@ o-@@ acid requirements from available plant resources .
Moreover , failure to do so has serious consequences : growth depression , mal@@ nutrition , and ultimately death .
The most read@@ ily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins accessible in leaves and leg@@ umes , but these are hard for pri@@ mates like us to dig@@ est unless they are cooked .
In contrast , animal foods ( ants , ter@@ mit@@ es , eggs ) not only are easily dig@@ esti@@ ble , but they provide high-@@ quantity proteins that contain all the essential am@@ ino ac@@ ids .
All things considered , we should not be surprised if our own ancest@@ ors solved their " protein problem " in somewhat the same way that c@@ him@@ ps on the sav@@ anna do today .
S@@ leep inter@@ ruption is the process of pur@@ pos@@ efully aw@@ ak@@ ening during your normal sleep period and falling as@@ leep a short time later ( 10-@@ 60 minutes ) .
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully w@@ aking you .
If you find yourself res@@ etting the clock in your sleep , it can be placed on the other side of the room , forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off .
Other bi@@ or@@ hy@@ th@@ m@@ -based options involve drinking lots of fluid ( particularly water or tea , a known di@@ ure@@ tic ) prior to sleep , forcing one to get up to ur@@ inate .
The amount of inner peace a person poss@@ esses cor@@ relates oppos@@ itely to the amount of tension in one ' s body and spirit .
The lower the tension , the more positive the life force present . Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and cont@@ ent@@ ment .
Everyone can achieve en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment . The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and neg@@ ativity .
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha , but were extended by the ma@@ ha@@ yana path of love and by a lot of techniques from Indian Yoga .
In principle the Tibetan Buddhism is very simple . It consists of K@@ und@@ al@@ ini Yoga , meditation and the path of all-@@ embrac@@ ing love .
With K@@ und@@ al@@ ini Yoga the K@@ und@@ al@@ ini energy ( en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment energy ) is aw@@ ak@@ ened through yoga post@@ ures , breathing exercises , man@@ tras and vis@@ u@@ aliz@@ ations .
The center of Tibetan meditation is the De@@ ity Yoga . Through the vis@@ u@@ alization of various deities the energy channels are clean@@ ed , the cha@@ k@@ ras are activ@@ ated and the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment consciousness is created .
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2 , leading to cooperation between the US@@ SR and USA . With the end of the war the clashes of system , process and culture led to the countries falling out .
With two years of the end of the war , the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began .
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought for real , by pro@@ x@@ y armies , on batt@@ le@@ fields from Africa to Asia , in Afghanistan , Cu@@ ba and many other places .
By September 17 , 1939 , the Pol@@ ish defense was already broken , and the only hope was to ret@@ reat and re@@ organise along the Rom@@ an@@ ian bri@@ d@@ ge@@ head .
However , these plans were rendered ob@@ sol@@ ete nearly overnight , when over 8@@ 00,000 soldiers from the Soviet ' s Union Red Army entered and created the Bel@@ ar@@ us@@ sian and Ukrain@@ ian fron@@ ts after inv@@ ading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the R@@ ig@@ a Peace Treaty , the Sovi@@ et-@@ Pol@@ ish Non-@@ A@@ gg@@ ression P@@ act , and other international tre@@ ati@@ es , both bilateral and multilateral .
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oc@@ eans .
The job of nav@@ ies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods , while at the same time , interf@@ ering with your enemy ' s ability to move his people and goods .
One of the most note@@ worthy recent examples of this was the North At@@ lan@@ tic campaign of W@@ W@@ II . The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the At@@ lan@@ tic Ocean to help Britain .
At the same time , the German nav@@ y , using mainly U-@@ boats , was trying to stop this traffic .
Had the Al@@ lies failed , Germany probably would have been able to conqu@@ er Britain as it had the rest of Europe .
Go@@ ats seem to have been first dom@@ esti@@ cated roughly 10,000 years ago in the Z@@ ag@@ ro@@ s Moun@@ tains of Iran .
An@@ ci@@ ent cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk , hair , meat , and sk@@ ins .
Domestic go@@ ats were generally kept in her@@ ds that wan@@ dered on hills or other gr@@ az@@ ing areas , often t@@ ended by go@@ ath@@ er@@ ds who were frequently children or adoles@@ c@@ ents , similar to the more widely known shepher@@ d . These methods of her@@ ding are still used today .
W@@ agon@@ ways were built in England as early as the 16th Cent@@ ury .
Although w@@ agon@@ ways merely consist@@ ed of parallel plan@@ ks of wood , they allowed horses pul@@ ling them to achieve greater spe@@ eds and pull larger loads than on the slightly more rough roads of the day .
C@@ ros@@ sti@@ es were introduced fairly early to hold the tracks in place . Gr@@ ad@@ ually , however , it was realised that tracks would be more efficient if they had a sti@@ p of iron on the top .
This became common practice , but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the w@@ ag@@ ons .
Ev@@ ent@@ ually , wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels . In 17@@ 67 , the first full-@@ iron rail@@ s were introduced .
The first known transportation was walking , humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emer@@ gence of Hom@@ o E@@ rec@@ tus ( meaning upright man ) .
Their predec@@ essors , the Austr@@ al@@ op@@ ith@@ ec@@ us did not walk upright as hab@@ itu@@ ally .
Bi@@ pe@@ dal speci@@ aliz@@ ations are found in Austr@@ al@@ op@@ ith@@ ec@@ us fos@@ sil@@ s from 4.@@ 2-@@ 3.@@ 9 million years ago , although Sa@@ hel@@ anth@@ rop@@ us may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago .
We can start living more friendly to the environment , we can join to the environmental movement , and we can even be activists in order to reduce the future suffering in some degree .
This is just like symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment in many cases . However , if we do not only want a temporary solution , then we should find the root of the problems , and we should de@@ activ@@ ate them .
It is obvious enough that the world has changed much because of human@@ kind ' s scientific and technological adv@@ anc@@ ements , and problems have become greater because of over@@ population and mankind ' s ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant lifestyle .
After its adoption by Congress on July 4 , a hand@@ written draft signed by the President of Congress John H@@ anc@@ ock and the Secretary Charles Thom@@ son was then sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dun@@ la@@ p .
Through the night between 150 and 200 copies were made , now known as " Dun@@ la@@ p broad@@ sides . "
The first public reading of the document was by John N@@ ix@@ on in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8 .
One was sent to George Washington on July 6 , who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9 . A copy reached London on August 10 .
The 25 Dun@@ la@@ p broad@@ sides still known to exist are the oldest surviv@@ ing copies of the document . The original hand@@ written copy has not survived .
Many pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ologists today believe that one group of d@@ in@@ os@@ aur@@ s survived and is alive today . We call them birds .
Many people don ' t think about them as d@@ in@@ os@@ aur@@ s because they have fe@@ athers and can fly .
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like a d@@ in@@ os@@ aur .
They have feet with scal@@ es and cl@@ aw@@ s , they lay eggs , and they walk on their two back legs like a T-@@ Re@@ x .
Vir@@ tually all computers in use today are based on the manip@@ ulation of information which is cod@@ ed in the form of b@@ inary numbers .
A b@@ inary number can have only one of two values , i.e. 0 or 1 , and these numbers are referred to as b@@ inary dig@@ its - or b@@ its , to use computer j@@ arg@@ on .
Internal pois@@ oning may not be immediately apparent . Sy@@ mp@@ toms , such as v@@ om@@ iting are suff@@ iciently general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made .
The best indication of internal pois@@ oning may be the presence of an open container of medic@@ ation or toxic household chemicals .
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific po@@ ison .
The term bu@@ g is used by ent@@ om@@ ologists in a formal sense for this group of insects .
This term der@@ ives from ancient famili@@ arity with B@@ ed-@@ bu@@ gs , which are insects highly adap@@ ted to par@@ as@@ iti@@ ze humans .
Both Ass@@ ass@@ in-@@ bu@@ gs and B@@ ed-@@ bu@@ gs are ni@@ dic@@ ol@@ ous , adap@@ ted to living in nest or housing of their host .
Ac@@ ross the United States of America , there are approximately 4@@ 00,000 known cases of Multi@@ ple S@@ cler@@ osis ( MS ) , leaving it as the leading neuro@@ logical disease in younger and middle aged adults .
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system , which is made up of the brain , the sp@@ inal cor@@ d and the op@@ tic n@@ erve .
Research has found that females are two times more likely to have MS then males .
A couple may decide it is not in their best interest , or in the interest of their child , to raise a baby .
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby .
In an adoption , the birth parents termin@@ ate their paren@@ tal rights so that another couple may parent the child .
Science ' s main goal is to figure out the way the world works through the scientific method . This method in fact guides most scientific research .
It isn ' t alone though , experim@@ entation , and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypo@@ thes@@ es , asking questions , and making observations also guide scientific research .
Nat@@ ur@@ alists and philosoph@@ ers focused on classical texts and , in particular , on the Bible in Latin .
Acc@@ ep@@ ted were A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le ' s views on all matters of science , including psych@@ ology .
As knowledge of Greek declined , the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosoph@@ ical and scientific roots .
Many observed rhy@@ th@@ ms in physi@@ ology and behavior often cru@@ ci@@ ally depend on the presence of end@@ ogen@@ ous cycles and their production through biological c@@ locks .
Peri@@ odi@@ c rhy@@ th@@ ms , which are not simply responses to external peri@@ odi@@ c cu@@ es , have been docum@@ ented for most living beings , including bacteria , fun@@ gi , plants , and animals .
Bi@@ ological c@@ locks are self sust@@ aining os@@ c@@ ill@@ ators which will continue a period of fre@@ e-@@ running cycl@@ ing even in the absence of external cu@@ es .
The Her@@ sh@@ ey and Cha@@ se experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a genetic material .
Her@@ sh@@ ey and Cha@@ se used pha@@ ges , or vir@@ uses , to impl@@ ant their own DNA into a bacter@@ ium .
They did two experiments marking either the DNA in the pha@@ ge with a radi@@ o@@ active ph@@ osph@@ or@@ us or the protein of the pha@@ ge with radi@@ o@@ active sul@@ f@@ ur .
Mut@@ ations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mut@@ ation , the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are ger@@ m-@@ line cells .
Only mut@@ ations in ger@@ m-@@ line cells can be passed on to children , while mut@@ ations elsewhere can cause cell@@ -@@ death or cancer .
Nat@@ ure@@ -based tourism attrac@@ ts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the sc@@ ener@@ y , including plant and animal wildlife .
Exam@@ ples of on-@@ site activities include hun@@ ting , fishing , photo@@ graphy , bird watching , and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem .
An example is visiting , photo@@ graph@@ ing , and learning about or@@ gang@@ at@@ u@@ ang@@ s in Bor@@ ne@@ o .
Every morning , people leave small country towns in cars to go their workplace and are passed by others whose work destination is the place they have just left .
In this dynamic transport shut@@ tle everyone is somehow connected with , and supporting , a transport system based on private cars .
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has dis@@ lodged the bi@@ os@@ phere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years .
Everyone particip@@ ates in society and uses transportation systems . Almost everyone compl@@ ains about transportation systems .
In developed countries you sel@@ dom hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling down .
Why do transportation systems eng@@ ender such complaints , why do they fail on a daily basis ? Are transportation engineers just in@@ competent ? Or is something more fundamental going on ?
Traffic F@@ low is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with one another .
Unfortunately , studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one-@@ hundred percent certainty .
Fortun@@ ately , drivers tend to be@@ have within a reason@@ ably consistent range ; thus , traffic streams tend to have some reasonable consist@@ ency and can be roughly represented mathem@@ atically .
To better represent traffic flow , relationships have been established between the three main characteristics : ( 1 ) flow , ( 2 ) density , and ( 3 ) velocity .
These relationships help in planning , design , and operations of road@@ way facilities .
In@@ sec@@ ts were the first animals to take to the air . Their ability to fly helped them ev@@ ade enemies more easily and find food and mates more eff@@ iciently .
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the body .
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from pre@@ d@@ ators .
Today , the only insects that cannot fold back their wings are dragon flies and may@@ flies .
Thousands of years ago , a man called Ari@@ star@@ ch@@ us said that the Solar System moved around the Sun .
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite ; that the Solar System moved around the Earth , including the Sun ( and even the other stars ) .
This seems sen@@ sible , because the Earth doesn ' t feel as if it ' s moving , does it ?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the biggest river on Earth . It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second biggest river .
The Amazon is also the wid@@ est river on Earth , at times six miles wide .
A full 20 percent of the water that p@@ ours out of the planet ' s rivers into the oc@@ eans comes from the Amazon .
The main Amazon River is 6,@@ 3@@ 87 km ( 3,9@@ 80 miles ) . It coll@@ ects water from thousands of smaller rivers .

V@@ ati@@ can City ' s population is around 800 . It is the sm@@ allest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population .
V@@ ati@@ can City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications .
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremon@@ ies .
All citizens of V@@ ati@@ can City are Roman Catholic .
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold , silver , and copper from anti@@ qu@@ ity , as these can all be discovered in nature in native form and are relatively simple to mine with pri@@ m@@ itive tools .
A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le , a philos@@ opher , the@@ or@@ ised that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements . They were earth , water , air , and fire .
This was more like the four states of matter ( in the same order ) : solid , liquid , gas , and plas@@ ma , though he also the@@ or@@ ised that they change into new sub@@ stances to form what we see .
Al@@ lo@@ ys are basically a mixture of two or more metals . Don ' t forget that there are many elements on the peri@@ odi@@ c table .
El@@ ements like calcium and potassium are considered metals . Of course , there are also metals like silver and gold .
You can also have allo@@ ys that include small amounts of non-@@ me@@ tal@@ lic elements like carbon .
Everything in the Un@@ iverse is made of matter . All matter is made of tiny particles called at@@ oms .
A@@ toms are so incre@@ di@@ bly tiny that tril@@ lions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence .
Thus , the pen@@ cil was a good friend to many people when it came out .
Sad@@ ly , as new@@ er methods of writing have emerged , the pen@@ cil has been re@@ leg@@ ated to lesser status and uses .
People now write messages on computer scre@@ ens , never having to come close to a shar@@ pen@@ er .
One can only wonder what the key@@ board will become when something new@@ er comes along .
The f@@ is@@ sion bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to put together a n@@ ucle@@ us with many prot@@ ons and neutr@@ ons .
S@@ ort of like rolling a heavy car@@ t up a hill . S@@ pl@@ itting the n@@ ucle@@ us up again then releases some of that energy .
Some at@@ oms have un@@ stable n@@ ucle@@ i which means that they tend to break apart with little or no n@@ ud@@ ging .
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust . The outer layer of the Moon is called the cr@@ ust .
The cr@@ ust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side .
It is th@@ inner under the mar@@ ia and th@@ ick@@ er under the high@@ lands .
There may be more mar@@ ia on the near side because the cr@@ ust is th@@ inner . It was easier for l@@ ava to rise up to the surface .

Gener@@ ally speaking , two behavi@@ ors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former pe@@ ers . One end of the spectrum is trying to remain " one of the guys " ( or g@@ als ) .
This type of manager has difficulty making un@@ popular decisions , performing disciplinary action , performance evalu@@ ations , as@@ signing responsibility , and holding people accountable .
At the other end of the spectrum , one mor@@ ph@@ s into an un@@ recogn@@ iz@@ able individual that feels he or she must change everything the team has been doing and make it their own .
After all , the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team .
This behavior of@@ t@@ enti@@ mes results in rif@@ ts between the leaders and the rest of the team .
Vir@@ tual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams , but there are sub@@ tle differences .
Vir@@ tual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group .
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams may meet according to var@@ ying time zones which may not be understood by their local management .
The presence of a true " inv@@ is@@ ible team " ( L@@ ar@@ son and La@@ F@@ ast@@ o , 1989 , p@@ 109 ) is also a unique component of a virtual team .
The " inv@@ is@@ ible team " is the management team to which each of the members report . The inv@@ is@@ ible team sets the standards for each member .
Why would an organization want to go through the time consuming process of establishing a learning organization ? One goal for putting organiz@@ ational learning concepts into practice is innovation .
When all available resources are effectively used across the functional departments of an organization , creativity and ing@@ en@@ uity can tran@@ sp@@ ire .
As a result , the process of an organization working together to overcome an obst@@ acle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer ' s need .
Before an organization can be innovative , leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organiz@@ ational learning .
Ang@@ el ( 2006 ) , explains the Contin@@ u@@ um approach as a method being used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance .
Ne@@ uro@@ biological data provide physical evidence for a the@@ ore@@ tical approach to the investigation of cogn@@ ition . Therefore it nar@@ rows the research area and makes it much more exact .
The cor@@ relation between brain path@@ ology and behaviour supports scientists in their research .
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage , tra@@ um@@ as , l@@ es@@ ions , and tum@@ ours affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions .
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before .
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simul@@ ation models which help us to understand processes in our mind .
Although AI has a strong con@@ no@@ tation of science fic@@ tion , AI forms a very important branch of computer science , dealing with behavior , learning and intelligent adap@@ tation in a machine .
Research in AI involves making machines to autom@@ ate tasks that require intelligent behavior .
Exam@@ ples include control , planning and schedul@@ ing , the ability to answer customer diagno@@ ses and questions , as well as hand@@ writing recognition , voice and face .
Such things have become separate disciplines , which focus on providing solutions to real life problems .
The AI ​ ​ system is now often used in the fields of economics , medicine , engineering and the military , as has been built in several home computer and video game software applications .
Field tri@@ ps are a large part of any class@@ room . Qu@@ ite often a teacher would love to take her students places to which a bus trip is not an option .
Technology offers the solution with virtual field tri@@ ps . Students can look at museum arti@@ facts , visit an aqu@@ ari@@ um , or adm@@ ire beautiful art while sitting with their class .
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect a on a trip and share experiences with future classes .
For example , each year students from Ben@@ net School in North Car@@ ol@@ ina design a website about their trip to the State Capital , each year the website gets rem@@ od@@ eled , but old versions are kept online to serve as a scr@@ ap@@ book .
B@@ log@@ s can also help improve student writing . While students often begin their blog experience with sl@@ op@@ py gr@@ amm@@ ar and sp@@ elling , the presence of an audience generally changes that .
Since students are often the most critical audience , the blog writer begins to strive to improve writing to avoid criticism .
Also b@@ logging " forces students to become more sav@@ v@@ y about the world around them . " The need to feed the interest of the audience insp@@ ires students to be cl@@ ever and interesting ( To@@ to , 2004 ) .
B@@ logging is a tool that insp@@ ires collaboration , and encour@@ ages students to extend learning well beyond the traditional school day .
Appro@@ pri@@ ate use of b@@ log@@ s " can empower students to become more analy@@ tical and critical ; through actively responding to Internet materials , students can define their positions in the context of others ' writings as well as out@@ line their own per@@ spec@@ tives on particular issues ( Or@@ av@@ e@@ c , 2002 ) .

All these things and more highlight On@@ t@@ ario as what is considered quint@@ essentially Canadian by out@@ sid@@ ers .
Large areas further north are quite spar@@ s@@ ely popul@@ ated and some is nearly un@@ inhabited wilderness .
For a comparison of population that sur@@ prises many : There are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadian citizens .
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa .
Mad@@ ag@@ as@@ car is by far the biggest , and a continent on its own when it comes to wildlife .
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations , or associated with France , and known as luxury beach resor@@ ts .
The Arab@@ s also brought Islam to the lands , and it took in a big way in the Com@@ or@@ os and May@@ ott@@ e .
European influence and colon@@ i@@ alism began in the 15th century , as Portuguese explo@@ rer Vas@@ co da G@@ ama found the Cap@@ e Rou@@ te from Europe to India .
In the north the region is b@@ ounded by the Sa@@ hel , and in the south and west by the At@@ lan@@ tic Ocean .
Women : It is recommended that any women travellers say that they are married , regardless of actual mar@@ ital status .
It is helpful to also wear a ring ( just not one that looks too expensive .
Women should realize that cultural differences may result in what they would consider harassment and it is not un@@ common to be followed , gr@@ abbed by the arm , etc .
Be firm in turning down men , and don ' t be afraid to stand your ground ( cultural differences or not , it doesn ' t make it ok ! ) .
The modern city of Cas@@ abl@@ anc@@ a was founded by Ber@@ ber fishermen in the 10th century B@@ CE , and was used by the Pho@@ en@@ icians , Romans , and the Me@@ ren@@ ids as a strategic port called An@@ f@@ a .
The Portuguese destroyed it and re@@ built it under the name C@@ asa Br@@ anc@@ a , only to aband@@ on it after an earthquake in 17@@ 55 .
The Mor@@ oc@@ can sul@@ tan re@@ built the city as Dar@@ u l-@@ Bad@@ ya and it was given the name Cas@@ abl@@ anc@@ a by Spanish traders who established trading bases there .
Cas@@ abl@@ anc@@ a is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Mor@@ occ@@ o .
Around the old Med@@ ina it ' s easy to find places selling traditional Mor@@ oc@@ can goods , such as tag@@ ines , pot@@ tery , leather goods , h@@ oo@@ k@@ ahs , and a whole spectrum of ge@@ eg@@ aw@@ s , but it ' s all for the tourists .
G@@ oma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of Con@@ go in the extreme east near R@@ w@@ anda .
In 2002 G@@ oma was destroyed by l@@ ava from the N@@ y@@ ir@@ ag@@ ong@@ o vol@@ can@@ o which buried most of the town ' s streets , particularly the town centre .
While G@@ oma is reason@@ ably safe , any visits outside of G@@ oma should be res@@ ear@@ ched to understand the state of the fighting that per@@ si@@ sts in the North K@@ iv@@ u province .
The city is also the base to clim@@ b the N@@ y@@ ir@@ ag@@ ong@@ o vol@@ can@@ o along with some of the che@@ ap@@ est Moun@@ tain Gor@@ illa tracking in Africa .

Comb@@ ined with its relative in@@ acces@@ sibility , " Tim@@ bu@@ k@@ tu " has come to be used as a met@@ aph@@ or for ex@@ otic , distant lands .
Today , Tim@@ bu@@ k@@ tu is an imp@@ over@@ ished town , although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction , and it has an airport .
In 1990 , it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger , due to the threat of desert s@@ ands .
It was one of the major stops during Henry Lou@@ is Gates ' P@@ BS special W@@ on@@ ders of the African World .
The city is in star@@ k contrast to the rest of the country ' s cities , because it has more of an Arabic fl@@ air than of an African .
The K@@ ru@@ ger National Park ( K@@ N@@ P ) lies in the north-@@ east of South Africa and runs along the border of Moz@@ ambi@@ que in the east , Zimbabwe in the north , and the southern border is the Cro@@ cod@@ ile River .
The park covers 19,@@ 500 km ² and is divided in 14 different ec@@ o@@ zones , each supporting different wildlife .
It is one of the main attrac@@ tions of South Africa and it is considered the flagship of South African National Par@@ ks ( S@@ AN@@ Par@@ ks ) .
As with all South African National Par@@ ks , there are daily conservation and entry fees for the park .
It may also be beneficial for one to buy a Wil@@ d Card , which provides entry to either sel@@ ections of parks in South Africa or all of the South African National Par@@ ks .
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists regard as the main focus .
The parade of buildings that make the Hong Kong sk@@ y@@ line has been lik@@ ened to a gl@@ it@@ tering bar chart that is made apparent by the presence of the waters of Victoria Har@@ b@@ our .
To get the best views of Hong Kong , leave the island and head for the K@@ ow@@ lo@@ on water@@ front opposite .
The great majority of Hong Kong Island ' s urban development is d@@ ensely packed on rec@@ l@@ aimed land along the northern shore .
This is the place the British colon@@ is@@ ers took as their own and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory ' s colonial past , this is a good place to start .
The Sun@@ dar@@ bans are the largest lit@@ toral mang@@ ro@@ ve belt in the world , stret@@ ching 80 km ( 50 mi ) into the Bangladeshi and Indian h@@ inter@@ land from the coast .
The Sun@@ dar@@ bans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage S@@ ite . The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sun@@ dar@@ bans National Park .
The forests aren ' t just mang@@ ro@@ ve sw@@ am@@ ps though - they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jun@@ g@@ les which once covered the Gang@@ etic plain .
The Sun@@ dar@@ bans cover an area of 3,@@ 8@@ 50 km ² , of which about one-@@ third is covered in water / mar@@ sh areas .
Since 1966 the Sun@@ dar@@ bans have been a wildlife sanctuary , and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal ti@@ gers and about 30,000 spotted de@@ er in the area .

The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017 , when the Braz@@ ilian customs check@@ points are expected to be finished .
The Guaran@@ í were the most significant indigenous group inhab@@ iting what is now Eastern Par@@ agu@@ ay , living as semi-@@ nom@@ adi@@ c hun@@ ters who also practi@@ sed sub@@ sist@@ ence agriculture .
The Cha@@ co region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Gu@@ ay@@ cur@@ ú and Pay@@ agu@@ á , who survived by hun@@ ting , gathering and fishing .
In the 16th century Par@@ agu@@ ay , formerly called " The Gi@@ ant Province of the Indies , " was born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors with the native indigenous groups .
The Span@@ i@@ ards started the colon@@ ization period which la@@ sted for three centuries .
Since the foundation of As@@ unci@@ ó@@ n in 15@@ 37 , Par@@ agu@@ ay has managed to keep a lot of its indigenous character and identity .

The official Fal@@ k@@ lands currency is the Fal@@ k@@ land p@@ ound ( F@@ K@@ P ) whose value is set equivalent to that of one British p@@ ound ( G@@ BP ) .
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands which is located in Stan@@ ley across from the FI@@ C West store .
British p@@ ounds will generally be accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stan@@ ley credit cards and United States dollars are also often accepted .
On the out@@ lying islands credit cards will probably not be accepted , although British and United States currency may be taken ; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method .
It is nearly impossible to exchange Fal@@ k@@ lands currency outside of the islands , so exchange money prior to leaving the islands .
Since Mon@@ t@@ ev@@ ide@@ o is south of the Equ@@ ator , it is summer there when it ' s winter in the Northern H@@ emis@@ phere and vice vers@@ a .
Mon@@ t@@ ev@@ ide@@ o is in the sub@@ tro@@ pics ; in the summer months , temperatures above + 30 ° C are common .
The winter can be dec@@ ep@@ tively chil@@ ly : temperatures rarely go below free@@ zing , but the wind and hum@@ idity combine to make it feel col@@ der than what the ther@@ m@@ ometer says .
There are no particular " rain@@ y " and " dry " seasons : the amount of rain stays roughly the same throughout the year .
Though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans , the wildlife is non@@ eth@@ eless wild and should not be fed or disturbed .
According to park authorities , stay at least 100 y@@ ards / meters away from bears and w@@ ol@@ ves and 25 y@@ ards / meters from all other wild animals !
No matter how doc@@ ile they may look , b@@ ison , el@@ k , mo@@ ose , bears , and nearly all large animals can attack .
Each year , do@@ zens of visitors are injured because they didn ' t keep a proper distance . These animals are large , wild , and potentially dangerous , so give them their space .
In addition , be aware that od@@ ors attract bears and other wildlife , so avoid carrying or cooking od@@ orous foods and keep a clean camp .

There are many be@@ aches , due to A@@ uck@@ land ' s str@@ add@@ ling of two harb@@ ours . The most popular ones are in three areas .
North Sh@@ ore be@@ aches ( in North Har@@ b@@ our district ) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Dev@@ on@@ port in the south .
They are almost all sand@@ y be@@ aches with safe swimming , and most have sha@@ de provided by po@@ h@@ ut@@ uk@@ awa trees .
Tam@@ aki D@@ rive be@@ aches are on the Wa@@ it@@ em@@ ata Har@@ b@@ our , in the up@@ market subur@@ bs of Mission Bay and St Hel@@ iers in Central A@@ uck@@ land .
These are some@@ tim@@ es-@@ crow@@ ded family be@@ aches with a good range of shops lining the shore . Sw@@ imming is safe .
The main local be@@ er is ' Number One ' , it is not a complex be@@ er , but pleasant and refresh@@ ing . The other local be@@ er is called " Man@@ ta . "
There are many French w@@ ines to be had , but the New Zealand and Australian w@@ ines might travel better .
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink , but bott@@ led water is easy to find if you are fear@@ ful .
For Australi@@ ans , the idea of ' flat white ' coffee is foreign . A short black is ' es@@ pres@@ so ' , cap@@ pu@@ cc@@ ino comes he@@ ap@@ ed high with cream ( not fro@@ th ) , and tea is served without milk .
The hot ch@@ oc@@ olate is up to Belgi@@ an standards . F@@ ru@@ it ju@@ ices are pric@@ ey but excellent .
Many tri@@ ps to the re@@ ef are made all year around , and injuries due to any of these causes on the re@@ ef are rare .
Still , take advice from authorities , obey all signs , and pay close attention to safety warnings .
Box j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish occur near be@@ aches and near river est@@ u@@ aries from October to April north of 17@@ 70 . They can occas@@ ionally be found outside these times .
Shar@@ ks do exist , however they rarely attack humans . Most shar@@ ks are scared of humans and would swi@@ m away .

Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels , although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation , like camp@@ ing grounds , through a travel agent .
Travel agents usually offer packages that include break@@ fast , transportation arrangements to / from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages .
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or proc@@ ure other documents for your destination ( e.@@ g. visa ) .
Any amendments or requests though should be cour@@ sed through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel .
For some festivals , the vast majority of the attend@@ ants to music festivals decide to camp on site , and most attend@@ ants consider it a vital part of the experience .
If you want to be close to the action you ' re going to have to get in early to get a camp@@ ing site close to the music .
Remember that even though music on the main stages may have finished , there may be sections of the festival that will keep playing music until late into the night .
Some festivals have special camp@@ ing areas for families with young children .

Any@@ one who ' s going to drive at high l@@ ati@@ t@@ udes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow , ice , or free@@ zing temperatures .
On ic@@ y and snow@@ y road@@ ways , f@@ ric@@ tion is low and you cannot drive as if you were on b@@ are asp@@ halt .
During b@@ liz@@ z@@ ards , enough snow to get you stuck can fall in very little time .
Vis@@ ibility may also be restricted by falling or bl@@ owing snow or by con@@ d@@ ensation or ice on vehicle windows .
On the other hand , ic@@ y and snow@@ y conditions are normal in many countries , and traffic goes on mostly un@@ interrupted all year round .
Saf@@ ar@@ is are perhaps the greatest tourism draw in Africa and the highlight for many visitors .
The term saf@@ ari in popular use refers to over@@ land travel to view the stunning African wildlife , particularly on sav@@ anna .
Some animals , such as eleph@@ ants and gir@@ aff@@ es , tend to approach closely to cars and standard equipment will allow good viewing .
L@@ ions , che@@ et@@ ahs and le@@ op@@ ards are sometimes sh@@ y and you will see them better with bin@@ oc@@ ul@@ ars .
A walking saf@@ ari ( also called a " bus@@ h walk , " " hi@@ king saf@@ ari , " or going " foo@@ ting " ) consists of hi@@ king , either for a few hours or several days .

Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympics , having hosted the games in 1964 .
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the post@@ pon@@ ement was announced , you may have a tr@@ icky situation .
C@@ ancell@@ ation policies vary , but as of late March most cor@@ onavir@@ us@@ -based cancellation policies don ' t extend to July 2020 , when the Olympics had been scheduled .
It ' s expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥ 2,500 and ¥ 13@@ 0,000 , with typical tickets co@@ sting around ¥ 7,000 .
Ir@@ oning dam@@ p clothes can help them dry . Many hotels have an iron and ir@@ oning board available for loan , even if one is not present in the room .
If an iron isn ' t available , or if you don ' t f@@ ancy wearing ir@@ oned s@@ ocks , then you can try using a ha@@ ir@@ dr@@ yer , if available .
Be careful not to allow fabric to become too hot ( which can cause sh@@ rin@@ k@@ age , or in extreme cases , scor@@ ch ) .
There are different ways of pur@@ ifying water , some more effective against specific threats .
In some areas bo@@ iling water for a minute is enough , in others several minutes are needed .
Fil@@ ters vary in effectiveness , and should you have a concern , then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a rep@@ ut@@ able company .
Trav@@ ellers may encounter animal pe@@ sts that they are not familiar with in their home regions .
P@@ ests can sp@@ oil food , cause ir@@ rit@@ ation , or in a worse case cause all@@ er@@ g@@ ic reactions , spread ven@@ om , or trans@@ mit infections .
Inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases themselves , or dangerous animals that can inj@@ ure or kill people by force , do not usually qualify as pe@@ sts .
D@@ uty free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempted from taxes and exc@@ ises at certain locations .

S@@ ti@@ r@@ rup@@ s are supports for the ri@@ der ' s feet that hang down on either side of the sadd@@ le .
They provide greater stability for the ri@@ der but can have safety concerns due to the potential for a ri@@ der ' s feet to get stuck in them .
If a ri@@ der is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the sti@@ r@@ r@@ up , they could be drag@@ ged if the horse runs away . To minim@@ ize this risk , a number of safety precautions can be taken .
First , most ri@@ ders wear riding boo@@ ts with a he@@ el and a smooth , quite narrow , sole .

Down@@ hill snow@@ sports , which include sk@@ i@@ ing and snow@@ boarding , are popular sports involving sli@@ ding down snow@@ -@@ covered ter@@ rain with sk@@ is or a snow@@ board attached to your feet .
Sk@@ i@@ ing is a major travelling activity with many enthusi@@ asts , occas@@ ionally known as " sk@@ i b@@ ums , " planning entire vac@@ ations around sk@@ i@@ ing at a particular location .
The idea of sk@@ i@@ ing is very old - cave paintings depic@@ ting sk@@ iers date back as far as 5000 BC !
Down@@ hill sk@@ i@@ ing as a sport goes back to at least the 17th century , and in 18@@ 61 the first recre@@ ational sk@@ i club was opened by Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ ans in Australia .
Back@@ pac@@ king by sk@@ i : This activity is also called back@@ country sk@@ i , sk@@ i tour@@ ing or sk@@ i hi@@ king .
It is related to but usually not involving al@@ p@@ ine style sk@@ i tour@@ ing or mountain@@ eering , the latter ones done in ste@@ ep ter@@ rain and requ@@ iring much sti@@ ff@@ er sk@@ is and boo@@ ts .
Think of the sk@@ i@@ ing route as of a similar hi@@ king route .
In good conditions you will be able to cover somewhat greater dist@@ ances than walking - but only very sel@@ dom you will get the spe@@ eds of cross country sk@@ i@@ ing without a heavy back@@ pack in gro@@ om@@ ed tracks .
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with many independent countries . Under normal circumstances , travelling through multiple countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control multiple times .
The Sch@@ eng@@ en zone , however , works somewhat like one country in this respect .
As long as you stay in this zone , you can generally cross borders without going through passport control check@@ points again .
Similarly , by having a Sch@@ eng@@ en visa , you do not need to apply for visas to each of the Sch@@ eng@@ en member countries separately , hence saving time , money and p@@ aper@@ work .
There is no universal definition for which manufactured items are anti@@ ques . Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as anti@@ ques .
The definition has ge@@ ographic vari@@ ations , where the age limit might be shor@@ ter in places such as North America than in Europe .
Han@@ dic@@ raft products might be defined as anti@@ ques , though they are younger than similar mass@@ -@@ produced goods .
Re@@ in@@ de@@ er hus@@ bandry is an important livelihood among the S@@ á@@ mi and the culture surrounding the trade is important also for many with other prof@@ essions .
Even traditionally , though , not all S@@ á@@ mi have been involved in big scale rein@@ de@@ er hus@@ bandry , but lived from fishing , hun@@ ting and similar , having rein@@ de@@ er mostly as draft animals .
Today many S@@ á@@ mi work in modern trad@@ es . Tourism is an important income in S@@ á@@ p@@ mi , the S@@ á@@ mi area .
Though it is widely used , especially among non-@@ Rom@@ ani , the word " G@@ yp@@ sy " is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative ste@@ re@@ ot@@ yp@@ es and in@@ accurate per@@ cep@@ tions of Rom@@ ani people .
If the country you will be visiting becomes subject to a travel advisory , your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected .
You may also wish to consult the advice of governments other than your own , but their advice is designed for their citizens .
As one example , American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations from Europe@@ ans or Arab@@ s .
Advis@@ ories are merely a brief sum@@ mary of the political situation in one country .
The views presented are often cur@@ sory , general and over@@ simpl@@ ified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere .
Sev@@ ere weather is the gener@@ ic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage , serious social disruption , or loss of human life .
Sev@@ ere weather can occur anywhere in the world , and there are different types of it , which can depend on ge@@ ography , top@@ ography , and atmos@@ pher@@ ic conditions .
High winds , hail , excessive pre@@ cip@@ itation , and wild@@ fires are forms and effects of severe weather , as are thunder@@ storms , tor@@ n@@ ad@@ oes , water@@ sp@@ outs , and cycl@@ ones .
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenom@@ ena include b@@ liz@@ z@@ ards , snow@@ storms , ice storms , and dust storms .
Trav@@ ellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area as they may affect any travel plans .
Any@@ one planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should get professional training .
A search of the Internet for ' Hos@@ tile environment course ' will probably provide the address of a local company .
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in far greater detail , usually with practical experience .
A course will normally be from 2-@@ 5 days and will involve role play , a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training .
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common , but publications dealing with war zones are few .
Vo@@ y@@ agers planning sex reas@@ sign@@ ment surgery abroad must ensure they ' re carrying valid documents for the return trip .
The willingness of governments to issue pass@@ ports with gender not stated ( X ) or documents updated to match a desired name and gender v@@ aries .
W@@ ill@@ ingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is just as widely variable .
S@@ ear@@ ches at security check@@ points have also become far more in@@ tru@@ sive in the post-@@ September 11 , 2001 era .
Pre-@@ operative trans@@ gender people should not expect to pass through the sc@@ anners with their privacy and dignity int@@ act .
Ri@@ p curren@@ ts are the returning flow from waves breaking off the beach , often at a re@@ ef or similar .
Due to the under@@ water top@@ ology the return flow is concentr@@ ated at a few deeper sections , and a fast current to deep water may form there .
Most deaths happen as result of f@@ ati@@ gue trying to swi@@ m back against the current , which may be impossible .
As soon as you get out of the current , swimming back is no more difficult than normally .
Try ai@@ ming somewhere where you are not caught again or , depending on your skills and on whether you have been noticed , you might want to wait for rescue .
R@@ e-@@ entry shock comes on so@@ oner than culture shock ( there ' s less of a hon@@ ey@@ moon phase ) , la@@ sts longer , and can be more severe .
Trav@@ ellers who had an easy time adju@@ sting to the new culture sometimes have a particularly hard time read@@ ju@@ sting to their native culture .
When returning home after living abroad , you ' ve adap@@ ted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture .
When you went abroad at first , people were probably patient and understanding , knowing that travellers in a new country need to adap@@ t .
People may not anticip@@ ate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travellers returning home .
The py@@ ram@@ id sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for kids .
You can see the py@@ ram@@ ids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins .
U@@ su@@ ally you always here the sound of tourists and vendors . The story of the sound and light is just like a story book .
The S@@ ph@@ in@@ x is set as the backdrop and the nar@@ r@@ ator of a long story .
The scenes are displayed on the py@@ ram@@ ids and the different py@@ ram@@ ids are li@@ t up .
South Shet@@ land Islands , discovered in 18@@ 19 , are claimed by several nations and have the most bases , with six@@ teen active in 2020 .
The archi@@ pel@@ ago lies 120 km north of the Pen@@ insula . The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Vill@@ a L@@ as Est@@ rel@@ l@@ as .

In remote locations , without cell phone coverage , a satellite phone may be your only option .
A satellite phone is not generally a replacement for a mobile phone , as you have to be out@@ doors with clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call .
The service is frequently used by shipping , including pleasure craft , as well as expe@@ ditions who have remote data and voice needs .
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give more information about connecting to this service .
An increasingly more popular option for those planning a g@@ ap@@ -@@ year is to travel and learn .
This is especially popular with school le@@ av@@ ers , allowing them to take a year out before university , without com@@ promising their education .
In many cases , en@@ rolling on a g@@ ap@@ -@@ year course abroad can actually improve your chances of moving into higher education back in your home country .
Ty@@ pically there will be a tu@@ ition fee to en@@ roll in these educational programs .
Finland is a great bo@@ ating destination . The " Land of a thousand lak@@ es " has thousands of islands too , in the lak@@ es and in the coastal archi@@ pel@@ ag@@ os .
In the archi@@ pel@@ ag@@ os and lak@@ es you do not necessarily need a y@@ ach@@ t .
Although the coastal archi@@ pel@@ ag@@ os and the biggest lak@@ es are indeed big enough for any y@@ ach@@ t , smaller boats or even a k@@ ayak offer a different experience .
Bo@@ ating is a national pas@@ time in Finland , with a boat to every seven or eight people .
This is mat@@ ched by Norway , Sweden and New Zealand , but otherwise quite unique ( e.@@ g. in the Netherlands the figure is one to forty ) .
Most of the distinct Bal@@ tic Cru@@ ises feature an extended stay in St. Pet@@ ers@@ burg , Russia .
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days while returning and sleeping on the ship at night .
If you only go ash@@ ore using ship@@ board ex@@ cur@@ sions you will not need a separate visa ( as of 2009 ) .
Some cru@@ ises feature Berlin , Germany in the bro@@ ch@@ ures . As you can see from the map above Berlin is no where near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise .
Trav@@ elling by plane can be a sc@@ ary experience for people of all ages and back@@ grounds , particularly if they ' ve not fl@@ own before or have experienced a tra@@ um@@ atic event .
It is not something to be ashamed of : it is no different from the personal fears and dis@@ likes of other things that very many people have .
For some , understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens during a flight may help to overcome a fear which is based on the unknown or on not being in control .
Cou@@ rier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly . F@@ requ@@ ently , time is very important with business documents , merch@@ andi@@ se or spare parts for an urgent repair .
On some routes , the larger companies have their own planes , but for other routes and smaller firms there was a problem .
If they sent things by air freight , on some routes it may have taken days to get through un@@ loading and customs .
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked l@@ ugg@@ age . Air@@ line regulations will not allow them to send l@@ ugg@@ age without a passenger , which is where you come in .
The obvious way of flying in first or business class is to for@@ k out a thick wad of money for the privilege ( or , better yet , get your company to do it for you ) .
However , this does not come cheap : as rough rules of thum@@ b , you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business , and el@@ even times for first class !
Gener@@ ally speaking , there is no point in even looking for dis@@ counts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain core group of fl@@ yers who are willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of getting somewhere fast and in comfort , and charge accordingly .
The capital of Mol@@ d@@ ova is Chi@@ ş@@ in@@ ă@@ u . The local language is Rom@@ an@@ ian , but Russian is widely used .
Mol@@ d@@ ova is a multi-@@ ethnic re@@ public that has suffered from ethnic conflict .
In 1994 , this conflict led to the creation of the self-@@ proclaimed Trans@@ n@@ ist@@ ria Republic in eastern Mol@@ d@@ ova , which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member country .
Economic links have been re-@@ established between these two parts of Mol@@ d@@ ova despite the failure in political negotiations .
The major religion in Mol@@ d@@ ova is Or@@ thodox Christian .
İ@@ z@@ m@@ ir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.@@ 7 million , the second biggest port after I@@ st@@ an@@ bul , and a very good transport hub .
Once the ancient city of Sm@@ y@@ r@@ na , it is now a modern , developed , and busy commercial center , set around a huge b@@ ay and surrounded by mountains .
The broad b@@ ou@@ lev@@ ards , gl@@ ass@@ -@@ fron@@ ted buildings and modern shopping centers are do@@ tted with traditional re@@ d-@@ ti@@ led ro@@ ofs , the 18th century market , and old mosques and churches , although the city has an atmosphere more of Med@@ iter@@ ran@@ ean Europe than traditional Turkey .
The village of Hal@@ dar@@ s@@ v@@ í@@ k offer views of the nearby island E@@ yst@@ uro@@ y and has an unusual oc@@ tag@@ onal church .
In the chur@@ ch@@ yard , there are interesting mar@@ ble sculp@@ tures of d@@ oves over some tom@@ bs .
It ' s worth half an hour to st@@ roll about the in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing village .
To the north and within easy reach is the romantic and f@@ as@@ cin@@ ating town of Sin@@ tra and which was made famous to foreigners after a gl@@ owing account of its spl@@ end@@ ours recorded by Lord By@@ ron .

Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site , as well as a site that has an almost in@@ calcul@@ able meaning to a significant portion of the world ' s population .
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here , and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there , Jews and non-@@ Jews alike .
Please treat the site with all of the dignity , solem@@ n@@ ity and respect it deserves . Do not make jo@@ kes about the Hol@@ oc@@ a@@ ust or Naz@@ is .
Do not de@@ face the site by marking or scr@@ at@@ ching gr@@ aff@@ iti into structures .
Bar@@ cel@@ ona ' s official languages are Cat@@ al@@ an and Spanish . About a half prefer to speak Cat@@ al@@ an , a vast majority understands it , and virtually everyone knows Spanish .
However , most signs are indicated only in Cat@@ al@@ an because it is established by law as the first official language .
Yet , Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities .
Reg@@ ular announ@@ cements in the Metro are made only in Cat@@ al@@ an , but un@@ planned disrup@@ tions are announced by an autom@@ ated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish , English , French , Arabic and Japanese .
Par@@ is@@ ians have a reputation for being eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric , r@@ ude and arrogant .
While this is often only an in@@ accurate ste@@ re@@ ot@@ y@@ pe , the best way to get along in Paris still is to be on your best behavior , acting like someone who is " bi@@ en é@@ lev@@ é " ( well brought up ) . It will make getting about considerably easier .
Par@@ is@@ ians ' ab@@ rup@@ t ex@@ ter@@ iors will rapidly ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ate if you display some basic cour@@ t@@ es@@ ies .
The P@@ lit@@ vice Lak@@ es national park is heavily fo@@ rested , mainly with be@@ ech , sp@@ ru@@ ce , and f@@ ir trees , and features a mixture of Al@@ p@@ ine and Med@@ iter@@ ran@@ ean veget@@ ation .
It has a not@@ ably wide variety of plant communities , due to its range of micro@@ clim@@ ates , diff@@ ering so@@ ils and var@@ ying levels of altitude .
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species .
R@@ are fa@@ una such as the European brown bear , w@@ ol@@ f , eag@@ le , ow@@ l , lyn@@ x , wild c@@ at and cap@@ erc@@ ail@@ lie can be found there , along with many more common species
While visiting the mon@@ ast@@ eries , women are required to wear skir@@ ts covering the kne@@ es and have their shoulders covered , too .
Most of the mon@@ ast@@ eries do provide wr@@ aps for women who come un@@ prepared , but if you bring your own , especially one with bright col@@ ors , you ' ll get a smile from the mon@@ k or n@@ un at the entrance .
Along the same line , men are required to wear tr@@ ous@@ ers covering the kne@@ es .
This too can be borrow@@ ed from the stock at the entrance but that clothing isn ' t washed after every user so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skir@@ ts . One size fits all for men !
Maj@@ or@@ can cu@@ is@@ ine , like that of similar zones in the Med@@ iter@@ ran@@ ean , is based on bread , vegetables and meat ( specially por@@ k ) , and uses ol@@ ive oil throughout .
A simple popular dinner , especially during the summer , is the P@@ a am@@ b Oli : B@@ read with ol@@ ive oil , tom@@ ato , and any available condi@@ ments such as che@@ ese , tun@@ af@@ ish , etc .
All n@@ oun@@ s , alongside the word S@@ ie for you , always begin with a capital letter , even in the middle of a sentence .
This is an important way to distingu@@ ish between some verbs and objects .
It also argu@@ ably makes reading easier , though writing is somewhat complicated by the need to find out whether a ver@@ b or ad@@ j@@ ective is used in a substanti@@ vi@@ zed form .
Pr@@ on@@ unci@@ ation is relatively easy in Italian since most words are pronounced exactly how they are written
The main letters to watch out for are c and g , since their pron@@ unci@@ ation v@@ aries based on the following v@@ ow@@ el .
Also , make sure to pronoun@@ ce r and r@@ r differently : car@@ o means dear , whereas car@@ ro means chari@@ ot .
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular gr@@ amm@@ ar .
Therefore , reading this gr@@ amm@@ ar pri@@ mer would help you learn much about Persian gr@@ amm@@ ar and understand phr@@ ases better .
Ne@@ ed@@ less to say , if you know a Rom@@ ance language , it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese .
However , people who know a little Spanish may ha@@ sti@@ ly conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it need not be studied separately .
Pre-@@ modern observ@@ atories are usually ob@@ sol@@ ete today , and remain as mus@@ e@@ ums , or sites of education .
As light pollution in their he@@ y@@ day was not the kind of problem it is today , they are usually located in cities or at camp@@ uses , easier to reach than those built in modern times .
Most modern research tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es are enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmos@@ pher@@ ic conditions .
Ch@@ er@@ ry bl@@ os@@ som viewing , known as han@@ ami , has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century .
The concept came from China where pl@@ um bl@@ os@@ s@@ oms were the flower of choice .
In Japan , the first cherry bl@@ os@@ som parties were hosted by the em@@ peror only for himself and other members of the ar@@ ist@@ ocr@@ acy around the Im@@ peri@@ al Court .
Pl@@ ants look their best when in a natural environment , so resist the temp@@ tation to remove even " just one " spec@@ im@@ en .
If visiting a formally arranged garden , collecting " spec@@ im@@ ens " is also going to get you e@@ j@@ ected , without discussion .
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to be and very easy to navig@@ ate , and you can buy almost anything after arriving .
But being placed in the " high tro@@ pics " just a few degrees north of equ@@ ator you will need to deal with both heat ( always ) and strong sun ( when the sky is clear , more rarely ) .
There are also a few buses going north to He@@ br@@ on , the traditional bur@@ ial place of the Bi@@ bl@@ ical patri@@ arch@@ s Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , and their wives .
Check that the bus you are thinking of taking goes into He@@ br@@ on and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kir@@ y@@ at Ar@@ ba .
In@@ land water@@ ways can be a good theme to base a holiday around .
For example visiting cast@@ les in the Lo@@ ire Valley , the R@@ h@@ ine valley or taking a cruise to interesting c@@ ites on the Dan@@ u@@ be or bo@@ ating along the E@@ rie Can@@ al .
They also define routes for popular hi@@ king and cycl@@ ing tr@@ ails .
Christmas is one of the most important holid@@ ays of Christianity , and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus .
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have been adopted also by non-@@ believers in Christian countries and non-@@ Christians around the world .
There ' s a tradition to pass the E@@ aster night aw@@ ake at some exposed point to see the sun@@ rise .
There are of course Christian the@@ ological explan@@ ations for this tradition , but it may well be a pre-@@ Christian S@@ pr@@ ing and F@@ erti@@ lity rit@@ ual .
More traditional churches often hold an E@@ aster Vig@@ il on Saturday night during the E@@ aster weekend , with the congregations often breaking into celebration at the stroke of mid@@ night to celebrate Christ ' s resurrection .
All animals that originally arrived in the islands came here either by swimming , flying or flo@@ ating .
Due to the long distance from the continent m@@ amm@@ als were unable to make the journey making the giant tor@@ to@@ ise the primary gr@@ az@@ ing animal in the Gal@@ ap@@ ag@@ os .
Since the arrival of man to the Gal@@ ap@@ ag@@ os , many m@@ amm@@ als have been introduced including go@@ ats , horses , cows , r@@ ats , c@@ ats and dogs .
If you visit the Ar@@ c@@ tic or An@@ tar@@ c@@ tic areas in the winter you will experience the pol@@ ar night , which means that the sun doesn ' t rise above the horiz@@ on .
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aur@@ ora bo@@ real@@ is , as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock .
As the areas are spar@@ s@@ ely popul@@ ated , and light pollution therefore often not a problem , you will also be able to enjoy the stars .
Japanese work culture is more hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ical and formal that what West@@ ern@@ ers may be used to .
Su@@ its are standard business at@@ tire , and cow@@ or@@ kers call each other by their family names or by job titles .
Work@@ place harmony is crucial , empha@@ si@@ zing group effort rather than p@@ raising individual accompl@@ ishments .
Workers must often get their superi@@ ors ' approval for any decisions they make , and are expected to obey their superi@@ ors ' instructions without question .
