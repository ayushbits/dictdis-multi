This construction is used in afterburning turbojets / low bypass turbofans used in military applications .
The schematic of a convergent-divergent nozzle is shown in Figure 6.44 .
Here again , flaps / petals for the convergent and the divergent are constructed and controlled in a manner that the control command is converted into articulated movements for the given geometry .
In both of the above cases , a fraction of the air bled from one of the stages of the compressor is allowed to pass along the wall and also close to the nozzle surfaces to permit film cooling .
There will be leaks from the system into the outer regions at several joints .
There could be leaks into the system at below nominal operating conditions since the jet pipe pressure will be below the nominal value and under some conditions , the flow separation that may occur in the divergent section might hamper thrust genera- tion seriously .
To overcome such problems , it would be useful to include a blow-in door ahead of the nozzle so flow could be inducted from outside and prevent flow separation problems .
Figure 6.45 shows the ejector type CD nozzle in which the cooling air could be substantive and use of a control flap along with the controls on the CD nozzle could generate a convergent nozzle , with blow-in door open when

The flow streams in turbofans used in military aircraft from the hot core and the surrounding bypass air stream are mixed before they pass through the nozzle .
Figure 6.49 shows a typical mixing device used on such exhaust systems .
Such a device called hyper-mixer provides very high mixing rate and mixing is completed in a short distance and it provides better propulsive efficiency in the case of turbofans ( two jets - the core hot jet and the outer cold jet going out of the nozzle unmixed provide lesser mean exit momentum flux compared to the mixed jet out of the nozzle ) .
In some aircraft like F-117 stealth fighter and B2 stealth bomber , the design has to preserve features of stealth apart from other considerations .
In such cases , one needs to reduce the thermal signatures of the engine exhaust .
This is achieved by mixing the exhaust with ambient air in a very short distance by using a two- dimensional analog of hyper-mixers of the kind discussed above .
In such aircraft , hyper-mixing is followed by an approach in which the jet flows over an extended surface - the trailing edge region of the wing to prevent access of hotter parts of the jet pipe and the engine to ground tracking .
6.6 Materials for Various Parts of an Aircraft Engine Table 6.13 shows the materials used for various components of a gas turbine en- gine .
The list is not complete and newer materials are continuously being intro- duced at component levels to enhance the properties and life .
All these take place since failures that may occur after millons of hours of operation are used to incorporate new materials where needed .
The table is self-explanatory .

In the case of air breathing engines - piston engines , gas turbine engines , ramjets and scramjets , the oxidizer is atmospheric air .
For flights outside the atmosphere , one has to carry the oxidizer and the fuel along with the vehicle and hence , one has a choice .
The choice of fuels for air-breathing and rocket engines is also wide .
The choice is made to optimize the performance requirements .
For air-breathing engines , the fuel chosen should reduce the cost of payload transportation without hurting the environment .
This is mandatory for civil transportation .
The cost of payload transportation is directly linked to the cost of fuel energy , a fuel of high energy that has remained cheap for the last seventy years of air transportation ( even though the cost of fuel has been rising over this period due to many factors including geopolitical considerations ) is the one derived from petroleum sources .
Aviation gasoline ( Avgas ) for reciprocating engines and aviation kerosene for tur- bine engines ( ATF - Aviation Turbine Fuel ) have become the standard fuels for use .
Low compression ratio reciprocating engines can accept high octane rated petroleum derivatives and gasoline qualifies for this purpose .
Several other prop- erties that dictate the choice of the aviation fuel are discussed subsequently .
In so far as energy is concerned , gasoline , kerosene or diesel and other derivatives have a calorific value that decreases by 5 % with the increase in density by 6.2 .
Because the difference between the two extreme fuels is in the C : H ratio , gasolines have higher calorific value compared to diesels .
In so far as rocket engines are concerned , one has to make a choice of the fuel and the oxidizer .
Key features that decide the choice of the fuel / oxidizer combi- nation would be the specific impulse and density impulse .
Others , like cost are important when it concerns large boosters , but not so for missile systems .
Operational Requirements Aircrafts based on turbine engines fly at high Mach numbers and also at high altitudes .
When flights occur at medium speeds , but high altitudes , the fuel in the tank equilibrates to low temperatures and could experience enhanced viscos- ity causing difficulties for the flow and in the extreme , lead to freezing .
Many a time , water gets into the fuel in very small amounts and could cause difficulties in operation .
For flights at high Mach numbers , the fuel tank could experience high heat load and this can lead to evaporation of some fluid that could further lead to vapor lock .
7.3 Fuels for Piston Engines , Gas Turbines , and Ram- Table 7.1 provides the details of the properties of some classical fuels for aircraft engines .
It is to be recognized that kerosene is a mixture of aliphatic ( straight chain ) and aromatic ( ring structured ) compounds produced from the distillation of petroleum crude , and it is possible to control the mixture to obtain a minimum of freezing point and a certain boiling range .
Thus , obtaining various " cuts , " it is possible to meet the needs for different applications .
In the development of fuels , JP - 1 was developed in the early stages and is now outdated ; JP - 6.2.was an experimental fuel ; JP - 3 was wide range fuel available extensively .
Its excessive vapor loss at altitudes prevented its use .
However , safety issues in operating fleets of aircraft out of busy airports remain to be addressed .
There are other issues of producing hydrogen at affordable costs that make hydrogen fuel as a future fuel for aircraft .
A key aspect of assessing the performance of propulsion systems is the determi- nation of the properties of combustion of fuel-oxidizer mixtures and in some cases , single compounds containing fuel-oxidizer elements ( like nitrocellulose or nitro- glycerine or a combination ) or simply in an unstable thermodynamic state ( for example , monopropellants like hydrazine as a liquid ) that they can decompose exothermically into products .
This problem , simply stated is : given the initial re- actants ( fuel + oxidizer ) and the initial temperature , to determine the adiabatic flame temperature and the equilibrium composition at a fixed pressure or at con- stant volume .
The former case approximates the combustion process of gas turbine and rocket engines whereas the latter approximates the combustion in a recipro-
In a gas turbine engine main combustion chamber , the fuel-air ratio is very lean .
In such a case , the maximum temperatures achieved are such that no dissociation of products will occur .
The principal products will be CO , and HO apart from Ny that is an inert .
One can compute the final temperature quite simply by equating the initial total enthalpy (consisting of sensible and chemical enthalpies) to the final enthalpy of the products at the final temperature.
With the increase in fuel-air ratio , the final temperature will cross 2000 K ( as will happen for the afterburner of a gas turbine or a ramjet ) , effects of dissociation will become important .
Many compounds will not remain in the most stable form - H , will decompose to H , O , to O , other reactions will lead to the formation of the hydroxyl radical ( OH ) , carbon monoxide ( CO ) , and oxides of nitrogen like NO , and NO ; .
These are valid for a C-H-N-O system .
If other elements like Cl , Al and Mg are involved , several other compounds get generated .
One will need to determine their composition as the adiabatic flame temperature is closely linked to the composition .
Thus , for rocket engines - solid or liquid - having not been limited to C-H-N-O elements , one can choose more reactive chemicals as one usually will and the peak temperatures that will be achieved will be between 2500 - 3600 K. At these temperatures , there will be significant formation of compounds noted above .
Calculation of composition and adiabatic flame temperature can be conceived to be carried out in two steps .
The first step is to calculate the composition of a given set of reactants at a fixed pressure and at any selected temperature .
For this purpose what matters is the count of elements .
For instance , ( Hz + 02 / 2 ) or H , 0 both have ( 6.2.H + 1 O ) atoms and are identical for computing the composition of a reactive mixture at say , 3000 K.
This is done by invoking two principal features - elemental bal- ance and equilibrium reactive condition .
Of the six mole fractions that need to be determined , two elements - H and O need to be preserved no matter in which form they exhibit themselves - as some OH , or H , O.
Thus , two relations relate to element balance ( same as mass balance ) .
The remaining four relations relate to equilibrium reaction statements and thermodynamic consistency .
These lead to a minimum independent set .
One can derive from chemical thermodynamics , an expression Kp ( T ) = ph2 / ph2 , for the first reaction and similar expressions for others .
Typical data for several gas phase reactions are presented in Table 7.2 .
These are shown only for select H2 -O2 reactions .
If we take note of the definition of various equilibrium constants and the values indicated in Table 7.2 , we can infer several useful results .
At 300 K , the values of all the constants are very small excepting Kp , 4 .
In these cases , it can be inferred that the denominator is much larger than the numerator .
As temperature increases , the values of equilibrium constants increase .
This shows that the possibility of dissociation is higher at higher temperatures .
Hence , one would expect that the equilibrium favors the presence of the species in the numerator more than those in the denominator at lower temperatures .
As temperature rises , values come down indicating significant presence of all the species at higher temperatures .
The pathway for the production of water vapor in actual reaction would be through a number of other reactions like H + H + O - HO and Ho + O + M - H , 0 + M ( where M is any species ) amongst others .
In these cases , it can be more easily seen that at low temperatures , the reaction is centered around H , O and high temperatures , all may be present .
In the case of Kp5 the value of the equilibrium constant is low even at 3500 K , much lower than values for the dissociative equilibrium of Hy and O , .
This implies very little dissociation of nitrogen even at high temperatures .
Thus , most air breathing engines where the temperature is limited to 2300 K , nitrogen can be treated as an inert .
Reverting back to the calculation of equilibrium composition , for a H2 - O2 set with the species being H2 , O , H2O , OH , H , and O , one has two element conservation equations and four equilibrium relations Kp , i , i = 1,4 as in Table 7.2 .
The six non-linear algebraic equations can be solved to determine the six partial pres
Thus , one can determine the composition of the reactive mixture at any given temperature .
Such a composition is a function of pressure as well .
If we take the simple case of hydrogen dissociation , we have H2 ↔ 2H .
This replaces the mass conservation relation in the present case .
When more than one element is present , one can form a set of equations from them and reduce them to a set one less than the number of element equations and complement them by the Dalton ' s law .
Manipulating the above equations , one gets For large Kj ; and relatively small p , one can simplify by expanding the terms under the quadratic to lead to This equation indicates that as pressure increases , pu , increases implying reduced dissociation .
Increased temperature implies increase in K , ; and hence , lesser py , and therefore , more dissociation .
These features are very general and can be used to draw inferences in several situations .
After obtaining the composition at any fixed pressure and assumed temperature for combustion of products , the second step can be performed .
The enthalpy difference between the reactants and the final products ( obtained at a chosen temperature ) can be obtained .
If this difference is zero , then it implies that the conversion process between the reactants and the products is adiabatic .
However , since the initial choice of temperature is arbitrary , it may turn out that the difference is negative .
This implies that the chosen temperature is larger .
If the difference is positive , the chosen temperature will be lower .
Thus , by a suitable iterative scheme , one can obtain the estimate of adiabatic flame temperature to the desired accuracy .
The enthalpy of species is composed of two aspects - the heat of formation and the sensible enthalpy .
The heat of formation ( denoted by AHY ) is the heat of reaction in a reaction in which the species concerned alone is the product and the elements that compose of it at standard state are the only reactants .
Table 7.3 : Heats of formation for selected species , * = kd / g-mole ; ( g ) = gas ; ( 1 ) = liquid ; s = solid ; no symbol usually implies gas standard state is chosen as T = 298.16 K and p = 1 atm .
The definition requires a statement of the heat of formation of the " elements " at standard state .
Species like Ha , O2 , C , Cl2 , N2 are taken to have zero heat of formation .
Other products like H2O , CO2 , and CO all have non-zero heats of formation .
Table 7.3 provides the data for a select set of compounds that appear in the products at high temperature .
Those species that have positive heat of formation at standard conditions may be thought of as unstable and would combine with other species to form stable species .
In the process of computation of the composition , it is possible that some of the products could condense into liquids or even solids particularly when the gas is expanding through a nozzle .
This will happen if metals like Aluminum are a part of the reactive mixture ( as the case will be for a solid propellant ) .
In such a case , the pressure exerted by the species will be equal to the equilibrium vapor pressure .
In such a case , a recalculation needs to be done by assuming the partial pressure as equal to the vapor pressure at the specified temperature .
Helmholtz free energy minimization for constant volume and temperature constraint and modified equations for constant enthalpy and pressure ( as required for scramjet application , see section 1.10 ) or in special cases , entropy and pressure as constraints .
The solution scheme uses a Lagrangian multiplier technique and starts with a simple estimate of the composition and progresses through iteration that invokes a relaxation scheme to ensure that undesirable overshoots / undershoots do not occur .
It uses standard thermodynamic data for over 400 species that are likely to be present in an equilibrium condition ( not all in a given case ) that are curve-fitted and are used automatically in the program .
In addition to obtaining equilibrium composition , it provides adiabatic flame temperature and equilibrium composition , rocket engine performance for frozen and equilibrium nozzle operating conditions , Chapman-Jouget detonations , and shock tube parameter calculations .
The calculation of the performance of a rocket engine involves first , the calculation of the adiabatic flame temperature and equilibrium composition at chamber conditions ( typically at a pressure of 10 atm to 200 atm ) .
As the flow goes through the nozzle , the static temperature and pressure keep decreasing .
Since the reaction rates are a strong function of both these parameters ( ̇ w ′ ′ ′ ∼ p2exp ( − E / RT ) the reaction rates keep dropping .
This happens in a way that beyond a certain area ratio downstream of the throat , the composition does not change .
The reaction path through the nozzle can be covered by computing the reactive flow through it and is complex .
A simpler procedure would be to determine the performance in the two limits - equilibrium and frozen .
The former implies that the composition achieved at each location along the nozzle would be that corresponding to equilibrium at the local pressure and temperature .
This is also called " shifting equilibrium " since the equilibrium is reached at different pressures and temperatures as expansion takes place .
The latter implies that the composition remains unchanged through the nozzle .
As already indicated , the actual result is between the two .
What is done therefore is that the code determines and presents the per- formance under options of ( a ) equilibrium operation and ( b ) frozen operation .
The essence of this procedure is to invoke the isentropic condition between the combustion chamber and the exit of the nozzle .
The entropy of a mixture of gases at a given pressure and temperature is given by where n is the total number of moles of gas , X ; = n ; / n is the mole fraction , 5 is the entropy at 1 atm and a function of temperature and the summation is taken over all the species .
The last term on the right hand side arises due to mixing of the various species .
If we take note of the relationship S0i = cp , i In T for constant specific heat , the above relationship becomes a result that is well known and is the basis of the simple isentropic nozzle analysis discussed in chapter 4 .
Once the limiting conditions of equilibrium and frozen flow have been explored , an estimate of the actual theoretical performance is obtained by a simple relation Isp , act = 0.7Isp , equm + 0.3Isp , frozen .
The code can be used to get a better estimate by allowing equilibrium expansion until an area ratio at which the temperature falls below 2000 K and allowing the composition to be frozen beyond this stage .
Hydrogen is a simply structured , easily igniting , fast burning fuel with high heat absorbing capacity ( compare c , of 14 kJ / kg K for H , with 6.2.3 kJ / kg K for JP class fuels ) .
It is , therefore , a preferred fuel for scramjets .
The weakest point about hydrogen is its low density even in liquid form under cryogenic conditions ( 70 kg / m ? ) .
In a vehicle design that has to optimize the space for hyper-velocity flight conditions , kerosene or its derivatives offer a much better choice with densities of 800 to 1000 kg / m ? .
Three directions that have been pursued are : ( a )
Three directions that have been pursued are : ( a ) designing a fuel that possesses useful properties - cooling capability through de- composition without generating condensable solids that could clog the injector orifices , ( b ) explore the use of an existing compound not identified yet as a fuel , and ( c ) use a combination of fuels , namely hydrogen and kerosene through suitably designed injectors so as to make available a fine spray of kerosene and a fast reacting hydrogen in the combustion chamber .
All the three approaches are being pursued .
Amongst kerosene - like fuels , JP - 7 is considered a good candidate .
It is heavily refined ( low aromatics ~ 3 % ) fuel developed specially for high performance , high Mach number aircraft , SR 71 .
Its thermal stability limit is about 560 K that implies a flight corridor with a maximum M ~ 5 .
For hypersonic flights between 6.5 or better , there is need to enhance the cooling capability of the fuel .
This is achieved by requiring it to be an endothermic fuel .
This means that the fuel has to decompose and the absorption of energy in this process constitutes the endothermicity .
The expectation is that at a typical temperature of 1000 K , the energy absorbed is about twice the sensible enthalpy .
At Mach numbers of 7 - 8 , the fuel heat sink required is about 6.2.5 - 3.0 MJ / kg and this can be met with at 1000 K with the magnitude of decomposition energy noted earlier .
Methylcyclohexane ( C7H ; 4 ) decomposing to toulene ( C ; Hg ) and hydrogen absorbing about 2.1 MdJ / kg of fuel reacted , n-heptane ( C ; H ; s ) decomposing to toulene and hydrogen absorbing about 2.3 MdJ / kg , methyl alcohol ( CH30OH ) decomposing to CO and H " absorbing in the dehydrogenation process as high as 4 MdJ / kg are some examples .
The disadvantage of methyl alcohol is that its heat of combustion is about half of JP class fuels .
This can be overcome by using higher alcohols ( like butyl alcohol , etc ) so that the benefits of calorific value are retained while achieving better heat sink capability .
These are the current areas of research .
Russians have very actively pursued high speed combustion technology using gaseous hydrogen and kerosene in a mode called barbotaging in which kerosene mixed with hydrogen bubbles is forced out of the fuel injection orifices leading to fine atomization of kerosene .
This is also called aeration in other literature .
Section 1.13 has provided a description of a solid rocket engine and the propellants .
Solid propellants are classified into homogeneous and heterogeneous systems .
Homogeneous propellants are such that it is not possible to distinguish between the components after the propellant is made - the components will have integrated into each other at a molecular level and are indistiguishable .
In the case of heterogeneous propellants , the oxidizer , and fuel components remain separated but in close physical proximity in a manner that the propellant itself is a structurally sound solid .
It would be possible to separate them , if necessary .
Homogeneous propellants were the first set of propellants to be made .
They are based on nitrocellulose , NC ( solid ) and nitroglycerine , NG ( liquid ) both of which have fuel and oxidizer elements in their molecular structure .
NC is slightly fuel rich and NG is slightly oxidizer rich .
The stoichiometric condition that provides high performance occurs at a NG : NC ratio ( typically , 6.5 ) that will be a slurry , since NG that is in large proportion is a liquid .
To ensure that the propellant obtained is a rigid solid , one needs to reduce the proportion of nitroglycerin substantially .
Typical NG : NC ratio will be 0.8 to 1 .
Hence , a homogeneous solid propellant is always fuel rich .
These propellants are also called double base ( DB ) propellants .
Propellant making requires other ingredients as well for the following reasons .
( i ) Since both propellant ingredients are reactive compounds , they tend to react slowly and degrade after the propellant is made and stored even at ambient temperature .
To reduce the degradation rate , it is necessary to add other compounds as stabilizers .
( ii ) The propellant so made must burn at a specified rate ( linear burn rate , r ) that is a function of pressure , ambient temperature and lateral velocity of gases .
If the burn rate of a propellant that has been engineered does not meet the requirements , then burn rate modifiers need to be included in the mix .
( iii ) The propellant made of NC-NG combination can be transparent .
This leads to unusual problem of radiative heat absorption in depth from the intense flame when the propellant is burning .
This leads to " bore holing " implying , undesirable subsurface burning .
To reduce this problem , one needs to add an opacification agent - could be carbon black .
In military applications , one wishes to have an exhaust that cannot be easily tracked particularly in the case of short range tactical missiles .
This can be encouraged by adding certain chemicals in small quantities .
Thus , propellant engineering involves incorporation of several ingredients all of which will have effect on the performance and this process is built on a foundation of extensive careful experimentation .
Heterogeneous propellants use a solid oxidizer , typically powdered ammonium perchlorate , AP ( NH , C104 ) with a polymeric binder .
To enhance the performance , finely ground aluminum powder is also added .
Typical solids fraction in a solid propellant is 87 % ( AP ~ 70 % and Al ~ 17 % ) and the solid powder needs to be mixed with the liquid polymeric binder till one gets a slurry that has to be cured to obtain a structurally satisfactory solid .
Typical heterogeneity is caused by AP particle size that varies between 20 to 500 ym and could be multi-modal distribution ; it is also caused by aluminum that varies in size between 20 to 50 pm .
Typical ingredients include curing agents that are solids or liquids ( ~ 2 % or less ) , and burn rate modifiers ( ~ 0.6.2. to 0.5 % ) apart from the oxidizer , metal pow- der and binder .
These propellants are also fuel rich since the peak performance obtained at near stoichiometry occurs at 92 % solid fraction , a level that cannot be achieved because the material does not have enough binding capacity to lead to a
Typical list of ingredients in DB , CP and CMDB is shown in Table 7.4 .
The list is by no means exhaustive .
Several other compounds are used as equivalents for those indicated in this table .
Fuels and oxidizers in the context of rocket propellants could be composed of oxidizing elements ( like O , Cl , typically ) and reducing or fuel elements ( like C , H , Al , Mg , etc ) in a proportion that could make a single compound burn by itself at ambient pressure or higher pressures ( more certainly ) , and yet reflect an over- all " fuel " or " oxidizing " character .
To appreciate this , it is necessary to examine the elemental composition of various compounds listed above .
The chemical composition of the compounds is presented in Table 7.5 and the properties of active ingredients - those that burn by themselves by being in a state ready for exothermic decomposition on initiation - are presented in the Table 7.6 .
Both these tables are very instructive .
The list of ingredients presented here are some of the most active compounds used for propellant making all over the world .
There are a few other compounds that have been used sparingly for specific applications .
These are TMETN ( Trimethyl Olethane Trinitrate ) , TEGDN ( TriEthylene Glycol DiNitrate ) and DEGDN ( Di Ethylene Glycol DiNitrate ) .
These are not disussed here .
The additional carbon that remains is taken as the residual fuel value and is presented as a ratio with the mass of the fuel .
If oxygen is in excess , all H is converted to H2O and C to CO2 and the remaining oxygen is taken as a proportion of the mass of the oxidizer .
In the case of AP , since chlorine competes with oxygen for oxidizing the fuels , more readily H , it is taken that a part ( half ) of
There are , however , more rational methods of describing the fuel value based on valency considerations ( see Williams , Barrere and Huang , [ 27 ] ) but it is sufficient to understand the principles stated here as in any case , these are indicative in nature and the actual composition at high temperatures is governed by a large number of other reactions and the formation of other species .
One uses the elemental composition and the heat of formation provided in Table 7.5 in the code of Gordon and McBride [ 50 ] as discussed in section 7.4 , to get the adiabatic flame temperature , equilibrium composition , and specific impulse that can be derived from a rocket engine working at a fixed chamber pressure and expanding to a certain condition ( say , from 70 atms with optimal expansion to 1 atm ) .
Figure 7.1 : Polymer chain process upper part shows a linear chain and the lower part shows cross linked chain .
The fuels for composite propellants must be chosen such that they are in liquid form to begin with ; they should enable mixing with solid powder of oxidizer and metal at as high a level of solid loading as possible leading to a flowing dough that can be cast into a mould before the " solidification " process begins .
To ensure that the starting " stuff " is a liquid that becomes later a solid , the choice of liquid is a liquid prepolymer .
Towards the end of mixing process , a chemical is added to start off the polymerization reaction so that a structurally acceptable solid is obtained .
The rate of the expected reaction should be slow enough so that when added and mixed in the mixing device , no significant reaction takes place , and the chemical is uniformly mixed into the propellant mass before polymerization process becomes significant .
The chosen combination should provide enough pot life for productive functioning .
The mechanical properties are controlled by the curing process .
Polymeric fuels can form linear chains that help allow large extension at break .
As different from this , one can connect up the chains at intermediate points by cross linking them ( both these are shown in Figure 7.1 ) so that the material becomes tough - extension per unit load is small .
Further , the polymeric material is a visco-elastic material .
This means that the properties are a function of time at the same loading .
One simple feature of such materials is " slumping " - a large solid stored for several months might acquire distortions due to self weight even at ambient temperature .
At low temperatures , most polymeric materials become brittle .
This is characterized by a quantity called " glass transition temperature . "
The glass transition temperatures must be lower than the lowest temperature at which the propellant is expected to function .
Higher temperatures cause softening of polymeric material and hence , reduction in mechanical properties .
Thus , the choice of the fuel for producing a propellant is made on the basis of ( a ) high solid loading to obtain as high a ¢ * as possible , ( b ) adequate mechanical properties at all system operating temperatures , and ( c ) ease in terms of handling and facilitation of the mixing process .
Over years , many polymers have been developed .
These are Poly Vinyl Chlo- ride ( PVC ) , Poly Sulfide ( PS ) , Poly Urethane ( PU ) , Poly Butyl Acrylic Acid ( PBAA ) , Poly Butyl Acrylo Nitrile ( PBAN ) , Carboxy Terminated Poly Butadiene ( CTPB ) , Lactone Terminated Poly Butadiene ( LTPB ) , and Hydroxy Terminated Poly Buta- diene ( HTPB ) .
The improved properties with the polymers developed over three decades has led to the choice of HTPB for most of the propellants at present .
The two primary approaches to making double base propellants are ( i ) casting and ( ii ) extrusion .
Casting process allows very large size grains ( as they are called ) to be made with the same ease as small grains and the shapes could also be more complex .
Usually , large size grains are cast into the rocket motor casing .
Such grains are called " case bonded grains . "
The extrusion process allows propellant grains of very good mechanical properties to be made , but grain size is limited .
This process can be used for small tactical rocket motors or what are known as " free standing grains . "
This implies that the rocket motor may be composed of several grains all of them identical and produced by the extrusion process .
The manufacture by extrusion process can be made solventless .
For the casting process , the preparation of a casting powder is considered the first step .
This is usually done by a solvent process .
The solvent used is typically acetone or alcohol .
Further processing demands finely cut pieces of similar size as it has been found that the liquid dispersion through the solid matrix will be better if attention is paid to the manufacture of the " powder " to ensure sharply cut well dimensioned material .
In the case of solvent-less extrusion process , a slurry of NC with water is ag- itated along with periodic additions of NG till a NC-NG paste is produced .
After the moisture is brought down to about 30 % by removing it by suction , it is mixed with all the other ingredients for a reasonable time ( 6 to 10 hours ) to ensure uni- formity , checked for the composition and then dried to < 0.5 % .
Then it is passed through hot rollers till the thin sheets are transformed into carpet rolls suitable for use in an extrusion press through a die to obtain the appropriately sized propellant grains .
The process described here may be treated as generic and several variants of the process are developed depending on the experience gained in the establishments .
The reproducibility of the propellant properties - structural and ballistic are very strongly dependent on the quality control of the ingredients with the presence of metals or metal oxides at a very minute level being monitored and controlled as well as the process scheme used .
At all stages in the processing various classes of tests on the composition and its uniformity , dilatomeric evaluation to determine volume changes and others are performed to determine if the process has gone on as intended , for otherwise , one might loose the whole mix .
The ingredients used in making a composite propellant are set out in the Table 7.4 .
The preparation for the manufacture of the propellants is to have ground and classified oxidizer .
One normally uses a bi-model distribution in making the propellant .
This helps better packing of the particles and obtain a higher solid
It is considered sufficient if a few size ranges of importance are verified before use as a quality assurance measure .
Typical particle sizes chosen are coarse of 200 - 300 pm ( 70 % ) and fine at 50 - 100 pm ( 30 % ) .
The fraction between the coarse and fine is varied to obtain burn rate changes as well .
Metal powder , say of aluminum is also an ingredient in a high energy propellant .
Its particle size is typically less than 40 ym .
Aluminum does not affect the burn rate except as an inert ( see section 8.2 ) .
The burn rate modifier is also to be processed by grinding and assessed for its purity , since its presence in very small quantities ( ~ 0.5 % ) can affect the burn rate significantly ( ~ 5 to 20 % ) .
Different batches of the compound may have ppm level impurities that can alter the burn rate by a few percent .
The actual process of making the propellant involves ( a ) mixing , ( b ) casting and ( c ) curing .
Propellants are made in small sizes as well as very large sizes .
A few tonnes per batch would be common in large sizes .
There are processes that are also continuous .
The mixing and casting processes require active control and care .
The curing process needs no critical manual intervention and is amenable to automation more simply .
The mixers consist of two contra - rotating sigma bladed arrangement to continuously bring in the materials for mixing .
They can be horizontal or vertical .
The process starts with the liquid ingredients - pre-polymers ( with molecular weight of 2000 - 3000 , viscosity of 40 - 50 poise ) being mixed with the ingredients that have the largest influence - the burn rate modifiers .
Batch addition of the oxidizer and the metal powder with mixing for a few hours will be repeated till the entire ingredients have gone through the mixing process for several hours .
The composition is checked at various locations of the mix to determine the uniformity of the mix .
It is to be ensured that the viscosity of the mix is within limits so that the visco-elastic material can flow smoothly , albiet slowly .
The curative agent is added at this point and the mixing operation is performed so that the curing agent is uniformly dispersed throughout the mix .
At this stage the material is ready for transportation to the casting section .
The final mixing operation is performed with vacuum applied so that any air bubble trapped in the dough will get expelled during the mixing operation .
The largest amount of use of composite propellants is for moderate to large sized rocket motors .
In these cases , the propellant is cast directly into the motor - to produce case bonded propellant system .
The rocket motor is prepared by doing the necessary internal cleaning and introducing the insulation system .
Typical insulator that has been used in large motors in India is called " Rocasin " rubber .
These sheets are bonded to the inner motor casing .
The casing for large motors is of metal and for upper stage motors , Kevlar fiber reinforced plastic .
The motor is located below a device that will allow slow flow of the material in a manner that prevents gaseous inclusions .
To help this , the entire casting with the motor and the mandrel arrangement is put under vacuum .
Figure 7.2 : The vacuum casting system , adapted from [ 15 ]
There are also other methods of casting called Bayonet casting and Bottom casting used in propellant making industry [ 15 ] .
After the casting process is completed , the hardware containing the propellant and the mandrel is moved into separate curing chambers that are maintained at suitable temperatures using hot air blowers .
Typical temperatures for curing are between 50 to 65 ° C.
The curing process needs to be designed carefully .
During the curing process , the low molecular weight polymer will begin to polymerize further - the molecular chains are built longer and if any cross linking process initiator is present , the cross linking also will occur .
This process of addition of molecules to the chain is exothermic .
Hence , the local temperatures will increase .
The outer stream of hot air is expected to keep the temperature rise within limits .
Since in reasonable size motors , the thickness of the propellant between the mandrel and the outer casing , called the web , is sufficiently large ( up to 1 m ) and the propellant material has a low thermal conductivity , heat build up in the core regions ( mid- web regions ) will be large .
Thus , the thermal design of the curing process should account for the heat generated locally and its weak dissipation at the boundaries to ensure that temperature limits are not exceeded .
If the limits are exceeded , de-polymerization will take place locally degrading the property of the propellant .
Hence , curing trials are made in motors with lower propellant mass but simulating the web and other conditions properly and thermal field of the curing propellant is mapped .
This is then simulated mathematically by solving the conduction equation with additional heat release term that would depend on the chemistry of poly- merization and the uncertain parameters related to chemistry calibrated against the measured temperature profile .
When these are known , the full scale curing process is simulated to determine the correct temperature for curing and the flux of hot air required to maintain the thermal profile within limits .
In some motors of intermediate size ( of the order of a meter in length and diameter ) , pressure is applied on the propellant during the curing process .
In such an arrangement , the casing-propellant bond is improved providing better structural integrity .
After the curing process that may take half a day for small motors and about two to three weeks for large size motors ( for instance , a 2.m dia motor with 0.6 m web is considered large ) , the motor is moved out of the curing section , allowed to cool down before removing the mandrel and the edges are trimmed suitably .
In order to obtain an estimate of the ballistic properties of the propellant , smaller size motors called ballistic evaluation motors ( BEM ) are also cast in a standard configuration chosen for them .
These are test fired subsequently to derive and confirm the projected ballistic parameters - burn rate dependence on pressure and ambient temperature .
The procedures outlined for DB and CP propellants are also used for making composite modified double base ( CMDB ) propellants .
In understanding the performance of the propellants , it should be borne in mind that Isp ∼ √ Tf / M .
One can notice that higher temperatures are also accompanied by increase in molecular weight .
It is the relative variations that dictate the performance .
The pattern is discernible for all the cases .
Oxygen is absent in the product gas consistent with the fuel rich nature of all propellant compositions .
The four compounds that influence the performance are CO , CO2 , H2 and H20 .
The relative fractions decide the molecular weight and the temperature .
The realized values of specific impulse in actual conditions would be about 92 to 94 % of the equilibrium value .
From Table 7.8 , it is clear that CP2 , DB2 , and CMDBS3 constitute practical compositions of high performance .
Other compositions are model compositions with illustrative value .
Further insight can be gained by examining how the properties vary through the nozzle under equilibrium operating conditions .
These are shown in Table 7.9 for pe = 70 atm. with optimum expansion to 1 atm .
As the flow passes through the nozzle , pressure and temperature decrease .
The way all the variables change is presented in Table 7.9 .
The thrust coefficient increases as one proceeds towards the exit of the nozzle with more thermal ( or random ) energy extracted to accelerate the fluid .
This also implies that the specific impulse achieved will keep increasing till optimum expansion is achieved .
The vacuum specific impulse is larger than the value obtained at any expansion ; since the negative term due to p , is absent .
The composition is seen to vary as one goes through the nozzle .
While the mole fractions of the major species change only slowly , there is rapid change of several radicals and the condensible species .
It can be noted that aluminum oxide is in liquid phase in the chamber , but condenses to solid through the nozzle .
In order to understand the role of chamber pressure , the results for different chamber pressures but expanding to ambient pressure optimally are presented in Table 7.10 .
It is clear from the table that the change in the characteristic velocity is only about 0.6 % and the change in the optimum thrust coefficient is about 12 % over the pressure range of 30 to 100 atm .
Further insight can be gained by examining all other thermodynamic and transport properties at the chamber and the nozzle exit in Tables 7.11 and 7.12 .
The values of v and . # vary through the nozzle ; the variation of v being very significant , more particularly because terms like v / ( v - 1 ) in the relationships between the pressure and temperature can exert large influence .
It is also significant to note that the Prandtl number under these conditions is quite low ( about half of the value at ambient conditions ) .
Two aspects relevant to grain manufacture are ( a ) inhibition and ( b ) insulation .
Inhibition implies arrangement of the geometry such that it will not burn normal to inhibited surfaces .
To ensure better bonding , the choice of the material is from the same family as the binder in the propellant .
The criticality of the role of inhibition is recognized if we note that it has to function at high combustion chamber pressures and in some occasions high temperatures as well - particularly in cigarette like burning motors ( see chapter 9 ) where the cylindrical grain will burn from the nozzle end for tens of seconds to minutes dur- ing which period the heat is transferred from the hot gases by conduction through insulation and metal wall to heat up the inhibition .
Any small separation between the inhibition and the propellant grain will allow hot gases at high pressure to enter in and ignite segments not expected to burn at that stage .
Such a condition is usually prevented if there is a chemical bond between the inhibitor sheathing and the propellant surface .
Typical inhibitor material is poly vinyl cellulose for DB propellants and could be HTPB based material for HTPB based CPs .
Insulation is related to a material of low thermal conductivity that can be wrapped around the grain or set as a next-to-wall sheathing into which the propellant is cast or inserted .
If the propellant is cast into a motor as in case bonded grains the outer most layer will be of insulation .
If the propellant is free standing , it could burn from the outer side as well and this will need a thicker insulation layer next to the metal wall to prevent heat transfer to the outer casing of metal or fibre-reinforced plastic material .
Figure 7.3 describes these features .
The insulating material will need to be flexible and for this purpose , synthetic rubbers are used .
To make them thermally resistent , they are filled with ceramic fillers like precipitated silica .
Recent trend is in favor of using inorganic elastomers like poly dimethyl siloxane reinforced with fibres of polyaramide .
Flame retardants like Antimony trioxide or phosphates are commonly used .
Curatives use sulfur compounds or peroxides .
Principal properties of the material helpful in the operations are the density , conductivity and ablation rate ( rate at which the material is consumed with the impingement or the flow of hot gases ) , all of which must be as low as realizable .
In recent times , developments of ceramic based throats have brought down the erosion rates by a factor of 6.2. compared to these rates ( see US patent 6510694 B2 by Lockheed Martin , 2003 ) .
In order to ensure that the insulation is reasonably well bonded to the propellant , a thin interface liner material of 100 to 200 pm thickness is introduced .
In view of better compatibility , the liner material is chosen from the same binder system ( as in the propellant ) and will have fillers , plasticisers and curatives .
In the application process , the insulation sheets are bonded to the inner wall with appropriate adhesives , and the liner sheet is then pasted before the motor is taken to the casting bay for introducing the propellant .
In X-ray radiography , the processed pictures can have various shades .
Lighter shades belong to metals like steel and lead that absorb much more energy , and darker shades belong to solid propellant grain , rubber and other resinous materials .
Neutron beams are attenuated very little by high density materials , but are ab- sorbed significantly by plastic materials .
Neutron beam radiography is considered eminently suited to inspect pyro-technic devices related to ignition , separation , cable cutting , and others .
It would be necessary to determine ( a ) the quality of assembly inside the pyro-device , ( b ) any possible discontinuity in the explosive train , ( c ) possible voids in the internal charge , ( d ) positioning of sealing devices , ( e ) moisture ingression and others .
Large motors like the ones for launch vehicles are cleared after 100 % radio- graphic study .
All aspects that create suspicion are reviewed and cleared for operation or specific repair .
Blow holes and cavities located close to the port that are easily accessible are opened up , filled with resin so that it will bond with the material of the propellant .
While the above discussion is largely concerned with propellants , the hardware also undergoes inspection by various methods - visual , die penetrant test , acoustic emission test are adopted at various stages in clearing the hardware - generally before the casting process .
Propellants are viscoelastic materials .
This implies that they carry properties of liquids as well as solids .
Like liquids , the stress is proportional to strain rate and like solids , stress is proportional to strain ( all taken in the small deformation linear range ) .
Thus , the behavior of a solid propellant is a combination of the above limits .
This has some simple implications .
If it also possesses " viscous " behavior , there will be slow deformation with time since the stress already applied leads to a strain rate .
The complexity for rocket application arises from the fact that stress and strain rates tend to be large more particularly during ignition phase at which time pressure build up rate is the highest .
This will lead to large stresses and the
For various propellants considered here , typical values are presented in Table 7.13 .
As clear from the tables , extruded DB propellant is tough and cast DB propellant follows it ; Composite propellant is flexible .
Tactical motors using free standing grains adopt EDB propellants and case bonded propellants adopt composite propellants gener- ally .
There are exceptions .
In these cases special effort would have been made to tailor-make the mechanical properties .
Figures 7.4 , 7.5 , and 7.6 show the variation of the flame temperature , average molecular weight of the gases and the specific impulse of double base and compos- ite propellants .
Introduction of aluminum increases the flame temperature by 10 % with change in molecular weight marginal so that I , goes up by 5 % .
CMDB propellants show an increase compared to the performance of DB propellants to the level of CP or in some cases , slightly better .
The more important reason for the emergence of CMDB propellants is the fact that by using RDX / HMX it is possible to equal the performance of CP with little smoke in the exhaust .
Since solid propellants carry both fuel and oxidizer components , they burn by themselves - in an inert atmosphere or an atmosphere of their products of combustion .
The most important geometric feature of their combustion is that they burn normal to the local surface .
This means a plane surface will regress in a planar manner .
A circular grain burning from inside will burn as circular surfaces of increasing diameter .
Equally well , if a solid cylindrical grain is instantly ignited all over the outer surface , it will burn into cylinders of smaller diameter .
The rate at which the regression occurs is called the burn rate ( the word regression rate also includes cases where the process is endothermic .
In these cases , the regression occurs because of heat input from elsewhere - from a gaseous flame , from a laser heating source , etc ) .
The burn rate depends on several variables - the composition of the propellant , the static pressure over the surface , the initial temperature of the solid , and the lateral velocity of gases over the propellant .
Since the burn rate is being discussed for a specific propellant , one needs to determine the influence of static pressure ( p , ; ) , initial temperature ( 7 } , ) , lateral velocity of gases ( V , ) on the burn rate ( ̇ r )
The effect of lateral velocity is also termed as erosive burning effect .
Typical parameter ranges are i = 0.1 to 50 mm / s , p . ; = 1 to 200 atm , and 7 } , = - 40 to + 50 ° C and V , up to 1.0 km / s , but more usually , 500 m / s .
A strand burner consists of a chamber that can be pressurized to the levels required and help maintain the pressure even during the burning of the strand .
This is achieved by holding a large volume chamber connected to the test cell containing the burning strand .
The strand is a propellant typically 10 mm dia or 10 mm square about 100 mm long suitably inhibited and held in a ceramic frame and attachments to initiate ignition .
The burn rate is assessed by one of the several means .
Wires pierced into the strand at equal distances ( say 30 mm each , three wires ) can be connected to an electrical timer circuit that operates in a manner in which burn up of one wire will initiate one or two timers and the the burn up of the following wires will stop them .
The length burnt divided by the time taken will give the burn rate .
This was adopted in the early periods .
In later times , optical measurement techniques by photographing the burning strand through a window , acoustic measuring tech- nique to detect the beginning and end point of burn of a given length and other techniques have been developed .
Most data when set out on a log-log plot show a line indicating a behavior = ap ] , where n is the pressure index of burn rate , and a the burn rate at 1 atm .
Similarly , to extract the dependence on initial temperature , the strands are conditioned at the appropriate temperature for five to eight hours and taken out from the temperature conditioning chests just before use in the strand burner .
The long duration of conditioning is required to ensure uniformity of the strand temperature because of the low thermal conductivity of the propellant .
The reason for using immediately after removing from the chest is to ensure that the heat pick up from the ambient does not alter the temperature .
The above equation can be recast as The most common behavior of the propellants is captured in Table 7.14 .
Specific impulse of a propellant affected by the adiabatic flame temperature and the average molecular weight of the gases is controlled by the equilibrium behavior of the chemical system .
As different from this behavior , the burn rate behavior shown in Table 7.14 is a " rate phenomenon " and so controlled by chemical kinetics and molecular diffusion .
In constructing the Table 7.14 , the data presented are the burn rate at 70 atm and the pressure index and temperature sensitivity around this condition .
In looking for " goodness " of propellants , burn rate at a standard pressure ( a7 , in the Table 7.14 ) is to match with a specific value required by the designer , the pressure index must be very low , and temperature sensitivity low .
Low pressure index is desired to enhance stability of motor operation ( see Chapter 9 ) and low temperature sensitivity is desired to ensure minimal deviation in performance with ambient temperature variation ( since several tactical rocket motors are deployed in open areas ) .
The choice of the reference condition for indicating the burn rate is at high pressure ( az ) because most propulsion systems operate at high pressures and therefore , the behavior at high pressure is more relevant .
This is particularly so since some propellants have varying index with pressure ( see Figure 7.7 ) and
Figure 7.8 : Schematic of a highly loaded solid rocket motor experiencing large mass flux in the port leading to larger heat flux to the surface and enhanced burn rate ( erosive burning )
This is present in propellant geometries with a port through which the hot gases flow from the head end to the nozzle end .
In highly loaded propellants ( implying that the port cross sectional area is comparable to the nozzle throat area ) , the mass flux of the hot gases moving past the burning surface is large ( see Figure 7.8 ) .
This is simple to see if we note that in a rocket motor the mass flux is the largest at the throat and by making the port size comparable to the throat cross section , the flux will be comparable to that at the throat .
Under these conditions , the convective flux to the surface of the propellant is enhanced .
This will cause enhanced burn rate .
Experimental data have been obtained by several kinds of apparatus .
In one of the techniques , the propellant is instrumented with fine wire probes embedded into the propellant at several axial locations .
The fine wires are electrically activated so that when they break , a signal is registered .
As the propellant burns through , these fine wires burn up giving indication to the arrival of the flame at this point .
By acquiring data from a large number of locations over the web and the length , along with the chamber pressure at the head and aft ends , one can extract the basic parameters governing the erosive burning phenomenon .
To process the burn rate data , one needs to create a gas dynamic model of the flow through the port .
This gives the mass , momentum and energy flux at each axial location ( see Williams Barrere and Huang , [ 6.2 . ] ) .
The flow through the port is one of continuous mass , momentum and energy addition into the port .
The enhanced mass flux implies increase in the local Reynolds number of the flow .
This implies a reduction in heat transfer film thickness and enhanced heat transfer to the propellant with consequent enhancement in the burn rate .
Experiments have also been conducted with two-dimensional motors supplied by hot gas from separate gas generators .
In one early study , tablets of test propellants were fixed in the test section and their burn rate obtained .
The photographs are analyzed to obtain the burn rate data .
These are combined with the analysis described above to extract the basic data on erosive burning .
Two general observations made in these studies are that the ( i ) enhancement in burn rate is observed only after a minimal velocity / mass flux , and ( ii ) enhancement is higher with a slower burning propellant ( non-erosive burn rate ) .
The data obtained over a broad range of conditions were correlated in terms of Mach number , mass flux , and pressure .
Figure 7.9 shows the non- dimensional plot with data from more than dozen sources .
These data appear well correlated by the curve on the figure even though there is fair amount of scatter .
The scatter in the data is in part related to the measurement techniques and in addition , there are differences in the results from different sources on the same propellant .
It can be noted that the idea of threshold mass flux is preserved in the correlation and the second observation concerning enhanced erosion for lower non-erosive burning rate is automatically imbedded in the parameter g ; decrease in 7 , implies increase in g .
It can , therefore , be used in design with confidence .
Pyrotechnic mixtures are classically used as ignition ingredients .
The choice of the ingredients is made to ( a ) generate sufficiently high flow rate of high temperature gases and ( b ) generate hot particulate matter so that the particle impingement
Small rocket motors use pellets in a basket made of metal or fiber reinforced plastic , with holes all around .
Larger ones can use a chamber filled with pellets and a nozzle at the exit .
This is used in intermediate size tactical motors .
Very large motors use pyrogen system .
This is a small rocket motor within a large rocket motor .
The igniter motor itself has another ignition assembly .
The exit of such a motor can have several jets located at different angles to enable the hot igniter jets to impinge on the propellant surface at different locations .
One of the key elements of the ignition train is called a squib .
It receives an electric current of suitable magnitude , transfers the energy to a primer or heat sensitive explosive .
Typical compounds are Mercuric fulminate or Lead azide .
Other details of the ignition system are discussed in Chapter 9 .
7.8 Fuels and Oxidizers for Liquid Rockets Liquid propellants are classified in several ways : ( a ) Monopropellants and Bipro- pellants .
Amongst bipropellants , the classification is , ( i ) Hypergolic ( self-igniting ) or non-Hypergolic , and ( ii ) Storable or Cryogenic .
Much research and development has gone into the choice of the propellants over the last six decades and in the early stages , many propellant combinations were tried out .
However , only some combinations have remained in use for long time till recent times .
These are the subject of consideration here .
One can notice that at 20 to 40 % Ammonia decomposition , one gets the best performance of Isp = 1900 N.s / kg .
Hydrazine can also be used as a fuel in bipropellant rockets ; it has been used in 50 : 50 proportion with unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine ( UDMH ) .
A brief description of the propellants can be found in section 1.14 .
The oxidizers ( a ) to ( d ) all can be hypergolic with a number of fuels , implying that they are self-igniting and therefore the rocket engines do not need any ignition system .
( 1 ) Xylidine , Triethyl amine [ ( C2H3 ) 3 N ] and mixtures , ( ii ) MMH ( Monomethyl hydrazine , CH3 NH.NHy ) , ( iii ) UDMH [ ( CH3 ) > , NNH > ] and mixtures with hydrazine , ( iv ) Kerosene ( RP series similar to JP series in air breathing engines ) , all of which are earth storable and the liquids in ( i ) and ( ii ) are hypergolic with the oxidizers ( a ) to ( d ) .
Kerosene is not hypergolic with any of the oxidizers noted above .
( v ) LH2 ( Liquid hydrogen , ) is a cryogenic fuel .
It is not hypergolic with LOX with which alone it is used .
Such a RFNA is termed IRFNA - implying Inhibited Thus , the propellant combinations can be ( i ) Xylidine / Triethyl amine ( also called g-fuel ) with IRFNA , ( ii ) UDMH with IRFNA , ( iii ) UDMH with NTO , and ( iv ) MMH with NTO ( these are storable hy- pergolic systems ) , ( v ) Kerosene with LOX ( semi-cryogenic , non-hypergolic system ) and ( vi ) LH ; with LOX ( full cryogenic system ) .
These are perhaps the most used combinations .
Military demand for little operational attention to the missile hardware and as well as instant readiness without having to fill up the propellants has generally resulted in favoring solid propulsion systems particularly when the advantage of lower volume and weight are better promised by solid propulsion systems ( due to equal or higher specific impulse and certainly higher density impulse ) .
The RFNA - UDMH combination can still be promising for smaller tactical systems .
The critical temperature and pressure are relevant since the operating pressure of the rocket engines is larger than the critical pressure in many cases .
In such situations , the liquids injected into the combustion chamber could behave like a puff of gas instead of having a liquid-to-solid interface with the associated fea- tures of heat absorption due to vaporization .
The heat of vaporization of many of the liquids is much smaller than of water ( . # for water = 6.2.3 MdJ / kg ) .
Other properties like specific heat , viscosity and conductivity influence the cooling properties of propellants .
Specific heat controls the temperature rise in the liquid state .
For instance , MMH is superior to Xylidiene in terms of heat absorption capacity .
Of course , liquid hydrogen is the best of all the fluids in this respect .
The choice of the propellant combinations presented in the table is made on the basis that these could be contemplated for use even today .
For tactical storable combina- tion , RENA-UDMH stands out because of its performance - stage performance ( in- flight ) of 2350 N s / kg for near-optimum expansion is realisable .
Replacing RFNA with NTO improves the performance clearly by about 100 N s / kg on optimum expansion basis .
Its use is more appropriate for space applications where the idea of storability has a different connotation .
The system is not expected to allow on- board storage except during the launch period .
Further , its use in upper stages implies that one expects the performance in terms of vacuum impulse .
Realised stage performance in flight for engines with high chamber pressure and higher nozzle expansion ratio than is presented here is about 3200 N s / kg .
Monomethyl hydrazine got introduced into the propellant system because of its superior handling characteristics and better heat transfer characteristics than hydrazine even though its performance with NTO is slightly inferior .
Of course , it cannot replace hydrazine as a monopropellant because as a monopropellant , hydrazine is superior due to the possibility of catalytic decomposition .
The choice of LOX - RP1 ( made in the early sixties for the F-1 engine that powered the Saturn rockets in the man-to- moon mission of the USA ) was based on the combined performance-cost criterion .
This combination had a high performance ( the specific impulse can be seen to be larger than other storable liquids ) but the lowest possible cost .
The difference between the equilibrium specific impulse and frozen specific impulse is about 50 to 150 N s / kg and the vacuum specific impulse is 200 to 300 N s / kg more than the equilibrium value at 70 atm .
The vacuum specific impulse is the relevant quantity for operation in space .
The nozzle area ratio used for constructing the table is such as to allow for a pressure ratio , p . / p .
The specific impulse values have an increasing trend with the choice of propellants indicating to the increase in the energetics of the propellants .
for all combinations except LOX-LH2 combination for which the density is only about a quarter of the storable combinations .
Consequently , the density impulse is also a third of those for storable combinations .
Thus , for tactical and booster applications , storable combinations are preferred .
For upper stages where specific impulse plays a major role , the full cryogenic combination LOX-LH2 is preferred .
It is interesting to appreciate the role of chamber pressure on the chamber properties and the specific impulse values for various fuel-oxidant mixtures .
As can be noted from Tables 7.18 and 7.19 , increase in the operating pressure allows the realization of high performance - raising p. from 30 to 100 atm increases the equilibrium optimum specific impulse by 10 to 15 % and most of it due to nozzle expansion process ( the change in ¢ * over this pressure range is about 0.6 % ) .
The high performance of LOX - LH2 is due to the the very low molecular weight of the gases .
Even though the chamber temperature drops by 10 % , the molecular weight drops by more than a factor of 2 .
This chapter has been devoted to the characteristics of fuels and oxidizers used in aeronautical and space vehicles or missiles .
Equilibrium composition of any fuel- oxidizer combination at a fixed pressure and temperature is dependent on the elemental composition and not on the chemical structure .
Flame temperature of the same fuel-oxidizer combination at any fixed pressure is controlled by the structure of the compounds and their enthalpy ( heats of formation ) .
Small changes in composition imply small changes in flame temperature and final composition .
As different from this , characteristics like burning rate and dependence on ambient pressure and temperature , particularly in solid rocket propellants are dependent on chemical kinetics and transport properties in the gas phase and small changes in composition can imply large changes in burn rate .
This sensitivity is exploited to change the properties ( like burn rate ) substantially by the addition of small amounts of chemical compounds while leaving thermodynamic properties ( like flame temperature and specific impulse ) unaltered virtually .
An important point to keep in mind is that the sensitivity of solid propellants to chemical kinetic features makes the solid propulsion system far more demand- ing in terms of quality control than liquid rockets or hybrid rockets ; this is not adequately recognized in literature .
Solid propulsion systems could be working wonderfully for many launches .
But a new batch of propellants loaded into the system could generate instability .
To trace back the precise components responsible for this behavior is an uphill task and the solutions are neither very elegant nor well understood so as to state that the true problem has been traced and resolved .
Liquid propulsion systems seem complex with lots of plumbing , control elements , turbo pumps and thrust chamber with intricate cooling passages .
Since the dynamics is controlled by fluid flow and well understood mechanical engineering , even the complex systems perform with precision , and even if they do not , the fixes are clear and much better understood .
Most combustion phenomena fit into one of these extremes .
In premixed flames , the fuel and oxidizer elements are mixed earlier to combustion and in diffusion mode of combustion , the fuel and oxidizer diffuse into each other at the flame .
The classification applies to gaseous , liquid and solid combustion processes .
Gaseous fuel jet flames , liquid droplet vaporization and combustion in gas tur- bines , liquid bipropellant rockets , solid composite propellants all are totally or partially diffusion dominated in their combustion behavior .
Gaseous premixed flames are characterized by the speed at which a flame travels into a fuel-oxidant mixture .
This quantity is called " Burning velocity . "
Figure 8.1 shows the gaseous premixed flame ( a ) and solid propellant combustion ( b ) .
The difference between the two lies in the fact that in case ( b ) , there are two phases - gas and solid connected by an interface and the gaseous combustion process is initiated by the volatilization of the solid fuel and oxidizer elements into the gas phase because of the heat transferred from the gaseous flame .
In the above equation the heat flux from the gas phase , ay ( given by the product of conductivity and the temperature gradient in the gas phase ) is balanced by the sum of the heat flux in the condensed phase and the flux due to heat of phase change at the surface .
Classical premixed flame analysis using asymptotic analysis indicates that near the flame zone , the conduction and reaction terms balance each other .
We recognize that & " ~ p " rexp ( - E , / RTy ) , where E , is the gas phase activation energy and n , is the reaction order .
The reaction order , n , is 1 for monomolecular reaction or a reaction with one reactant much in excess compared to the other , 2 for all bimolecular reactions .
For small transfer number they are about the same .
These equations indicate clearly that the pressure index of burn rate is n = n , / 2 .
For n , between 1 and 2 , the pressure index is between 0.5 to 1.0 .
If one examines the Table 7.14 , the pressure indices of propellants that qualify for premixed flame structure are the range of 0.6 to 0.83 .
This shows that the phenomenology related to double base propellant combustion is controlled by chemical kinetics .
It is a rate process .
This is expressed in terms of ppt = Asexp ( - Es / RTy ) , called the pyrolisis rate law , where E , is the activation energy of pyrolisis .
This value is typical for several propellants as observed in Table 7.14 .
The relative role of various parameters can also be noted from the above expression .
The data of one propellant on the burn rate vs. initial temperature is presented in Figure 8.6.2.taken from Suh et al [ 66 ] .
The initial temperature dependence is or = 1 % / K.
The figure has another interesting feature .
It can be noticed that the burn rate has a tendency to rapidly increase at around 145 ° C.
This implies that when every part of the propellant is at this temperature , all parts of it burn up without waiting for the conduction processes to bring up the specific location to the temperature needed for combustion as will happen normally ( for instance , propellant at 300 K ) .
This temperature is the auto-ignition temperature of the propellant and is indicative of the reactivity of the substance .
It is simple to begin by examining a gaseous jet flame - like from a Bunsen burner as in Figure 8.3 ( i ) .
We evaluate the height of the diffusion flame ( 2 ) as a prelude to obtaining the burn rate of a solid propellant in diffusion mode .
The flame climbs to the height , h because the oxygen in the ambient atmosphere has to diffuse to the flame on the other side of which the fuel arrives by convection .
Since the combustion process occurs at an oxidizer-to-fuel ratio corresponding to stoichiometric proportions , the ratio of oxidizer flow into the flame to the fuel flow rate must be in stoichiometric proportions ( s = stoichiometric ratio ) .
Figure 8.3 : The diffusive combustion mode ( i ) and ( ii ) ; Equivalent solid propellant combustion system ( iii )
The oxidizer flow is the product of the diffusion flux and the peripheral area through which this occurs .
A rigorous calculation yields the same result with the constant in the denominator of equation ( 8.14 ) changed from 8 to 48 .
Since the quantity Dp is independent of pressure , Equation ( 8.14 ) shows that the height of the diffusion flame is independent of pressure at fixed 7 .
Figure 8.3 ( ii ) shows the case with the fuel flow surrounded by the flow of oxidizer .
The specialty of this situation is that depending on the stochiometric ratio , an enclosed flame called over-ventilated flame may be located over the inner tube or get located in the outer tube , a mode called under-ventilated flame as shown in Figure 8.3 ( ii ) .
Now one can consider the configuration identified in Figure 8.3 ( iii ) in which a solid particle is surrounded by the polymerized fuel like in a composite propellant .
A heat flux balance at the surface is applied without distinguishing between the fuel and the oxidizer to get equation ( 8.2 ) .
In the equation ( 8.16 ) , the surface temperature , 7 ; and AH , depend on pressure ; but the depen- dence of AH ; on pressure is weak and 7 ; occurs both in the numerator and the denominator in a manner that the effective variation is marginal .
Thus , the burn rate of the diffusion controlled combustion is independent of pressure .
The burn rate is strongly dependent on the particle size .
Decrease of the particle size increases the burn rate .
Physically this can be understood in the following manner .
Composite propellants based on AP have diffusion controlled combustion and hence , show lower pressure indices compared to double base propellants .
Also composite modified double base propellants with significant amount of AP will show a similar behavior .
An observation of Table 7.14 shows that CMDB1 ( DB1 with AP ) drops the pressure index from 0.72 ( for DB1 ) to 0.4 .
Composite propellants when burning at low pressures show a behavior similar to premixed propellants .
The reason for such a behavior is as follows .
The diffusion coefficients depend inversely on pressure and hence , the tendency for fuel and oxidizer vapors to mix faster is higher .
Added to this , the reaction rates are lower at lower pressures ( varying like p2 ) .
Hence , even though the fuel and oxidizer are in " unmixed " mode , the rate processes get arranged in a manner that the flame is premixed .
Thus , for composite propellants , the pressure dependence will be higher at very low pressures and lower towards higher pressures ( i.e. , the pressure index decreases with increase in pressure ) .
Figure 8.4 : The combustion features and the temperature profiles in a double base propellant .
Composite propellants based on AP show a combustion behavior that has been explored a great deal because of their relevance .
At the simplest scale , the combustion is conceived as the burning of a single AP particle surrounded by polymeric fuel with no interaction with other particles .
Even this has sufficient complexity that understanding it has been considered essential before other complexities are resolved .
The single particle combustion has three minimum flame structures - a diffusion flame at the interface between the fuel and the oxidizer particle , called the primary diffusion flame , PDF , a premixed flame , APF above the oxidizer , and a final diffusion flame , FDF between the products of combustion of oxidizer par- ticle and fuel vapors not participating in the primary diffusion flame .
The heat transferred from each of the flames to the surface of the binder ( or fuel ) and the oxidizer causes the phase change from c-phase to g-phase by thermal degradation processes .
The flames shown in Figure 8.3 ( iii ) illustrate a part of the description noted above .
The primary diffusion flame can be an enclosed flame or open flame shown in dotted lines .
Which one of these will occur depends on the stoichiometric ratio , s and the relative velocity from the oxidizer and the fuel surfaces .
If s is large and fuel velocities are small , one gets an enclosed flame .
If s is small and fuel velocity is larger , open flame will result .
For axisymmetric configuration , it is possible to work out the structure of the flame .
The relative importance of the three flames with change in pressure can be qualitatively examined .
For pressures below the low pressure deflagration limit ( LPDL ) of AP ( about 6.2. atm at 300 K ) , one cannot expect self supported AP decomposition flame .
Hence , the PDF is the most dominant one .
As the pressure approaches the LPDL , the relative importance of the FDF and APF will improve .
Beyond LPDL , AP decomposition process along with the FDF will become important .
As pressure increases , the role of FDF will become more important .
Studies on modeling have been developed along a well known approach known as BDP model ( Beckstead-Derr-Price model ) in solid propellant literature ( see for a recent summary of the developments in this area , a paper by Cohen and Strand [ 47 ] ) .
Position of the flames marked there off ( primary diffusion flame shaded ) .
To understand the basic processes at a finer detail , studies on two-dimensional sandwiches have been carried out by several researchers .
Figure 8.5 from a recent study by Ramakrishna et al [ 63 ] indicates the relative importance of the reaction rates of a burning sandwich at pressures of 6.2. and 69 atm .
The behavior shown here is from calculations replicating many aspects of the combustion behavior of AP and AP-Polymer sandwiches quite satisfactorily .
One can use the mechanistic approach to predict the combustion behavior of say , ammonium nitrate - polymer propellants .
Ammonium nitrate is a lower energy oxidizer compared to AP ( it is not also a monopropellant - implying it does not burn by itself ) .
One would expect lower burn rate compared to AP-Polymer propellants due to the low energetic character .
Typically , the burn rate at 70 atm is about 2.mm / s with n = 0.6 .
The low burn rate implies a large flame thickness .
This allows greater possibility of the mixing of the fuel and oxidizer elements and the combustion behavior approaches a premixed behavior .
If this were not so , one would obtain a very low pressure index because the combustion behavior should be diffusion dominated ( without the premixed flame associated with the self-deflagration character of AP ) .
The role of burn rate modifiers also needs explanation .
The variety of burn rate modifiers is so much , and the effects are so particular to the chemical structure and dependent on the pressure range , that generalizations would not be possible .
However , based on several studies it is inferred that the catalyst ( a ) does not affect the sub-surface activity and ( b ) but affects the reactions in the gas phase , more particularly the decomposition of perchloric acid that is generated consequent upon the decomposition of AP into HCIO , and NHj3 [ 62 ] .
An examination of Table 7.14 shows that with the addition of Ferric oxide ( IO in the table ) , the pressure exponent n increases from 0.42 ( at catalyst fraction = 0 , row 7 in the table ) to 0.54 ( at catalyst fraction of 2 % , row 11 ) .
This is indicative of the gas phase reaction order increasing and hence , gas phase chemistry getting directly affected .
HMX based composite propellants function with a structure differing in many aspects compared to AP based CP .
The observed flame structure shows a visible flame that stands off at a distance from the surface somewhat similar to the DB propellants with the zone ( between the surface and the visible flame ) decreasing with increase in pressure .
HMX ( or in fact RDX ) is slightly fuel rich with a high flame temperature ( see Table 7.6 ) .
Hence , the role of binder in a CP made of HMX or the rest of the substances in a CMDB made with HMX would be to act as a coolant .
Consequently , the burn rate decreases .
This is clearly noted in Table 7.14 .
Also , the diffusional effects so dominant in an AP based CP reducing the pressure index cannot be expected in HMX propellants as these effects do not control the heat transfer rates .
As pressure increases , the reducing flame thickness with the high flame temperature of HMX monopropellant , will control the heat transfer .
Hence , the burn rate index of any high energy propellant made of HMX will not depart much from that for the monopropellant ( note that n ( HMX ) = 0.93 , and n ( HMX based CMDB ) = 0.83 , see Table 7.14 ) .
The mechanisms of combustion for monopropellants , hypergolic bipropellants and non-hypergolic propellants are all different .
In some instances , the facility to heat the thrust chamber to 100 to 300 ° C before the liquid spray is allowed to impinge on the catalyst bed , has been deployed .
The catalyst bed itself consists of alumina particles with high internal surface area coated with iridium , largely ( as indicated earlier in sections 1.14 and 7.8.1 ) .
The molecular process of decomposition is complex .
When liquid hydrazine is injected into the chamber , it flows through the interstices between the catalyst particles .
The capillary effect of the fine pores draws in the liquid .
The liquid vaporizes inside and in contact with active catalyst sites decomposes to ammonia , hydrogen and nitrogen .
During this period , the liquid would be continuing to move into the pore because of capillary pressure and gas pressure is getting built up due to the decomposition process .
There comes a time when the internal gas pressure exceeds the capillary pressure and the gas expels the liquid and comes out into the chamber .
Since the pressures ( due to capillary effect ) are large , the pressure at which the gas comes out is also large and the ignition process leads to rise in chamber pressure .
Slowly , over a period of time with the increase in the number of start and shutdown cycles , the sudden expulsion process leads to the creation of fissures and break up of the particle .
This attrition limits the number of cycles of pulsing demanded from the thruster .
Not only does the start-up have peaks in pressure due to the accumulation of the fluid and sudden pressure rise after a certain delay , the impulse bit that the thruster is designed to provide will also degrade .
Increased life of the thruster can be obtained by heating the thruster to higher temperatures .
The thrusters , the fluid line and the storage vessel are heated using on-board electric power ( from the solar photovoltaic modules ) to different levels of temperature .
The storage vessel can be maintained at 25 ◦ C , the line at 35 to 40 ◦ C and the thruster between 100 - 300 ◦ C
Use of higher temperatures will reduce the pressure levels inside the pores and hence , the structural integrity of the catalyst bed improves providing much longer life .
The catalyst bed on Voyager spacecraft is maintained at 200 ° C and is qualified for four hundred thousand cycles .
The arrangement of the particle sizes in the bed is also important .
The rate of reaction is dependent on the surface area of the catalytic material .
This implies one should use fine particulate material with high internal surface area .
The limitation , of course , is that the pressure drop through the bed will be larger .
Also , as the extent of use in pulse mode increases , there will be attrition of the particulate material and some of it will be washed out through the nozzle .
Accounting for these features , the bed consists of fine particulate material in the first part , coarse particles in the next part so as to optimize the surface area available and also al- low for some attrition without loss in performance .
The bed thickness controls the decomposition of Ammonia and thus , the performance .
In the case of hypergolic propellants , the mechanism is composed of liquid phase exothermic reaction that leads to energetic gas phase species that react further exothermically to generate gases at high temperature .
The exothermic liquid phase reaction is central to the avoidance of a separate ignition system .
A parameter that characterizes the time it requires for the propellants to generate burnt gases from liquid state at start-up is called the ignition delay .
Typical values for most hypergolic systems are 5 to 10 ms .
If this delay is larger , the liquid pumped into the rocket combustion chamber will accumulate in reasonable quantities and then suddenly get converted to high temperature gas leading to high chamber pressure rise with undesirable peaks .
This is particularly important in restartable systems .
Take for example the Lunar Assistance Module used by astronauts to land on the surface and then take off for the return journey .
The rocket engine must have smooth start-up even at the conditions of hard vacuum .
The ignition delay is best determined by using a micro-rocket motor with trans- parent windows .
The propellants are injected into the combustion chamber by an injection system typically , an impinging jet .
The phenomenon inside the chamber is tracked by using a high speed motion picture camera .
The typical parameters that are varied in such an experiment are : ( a ) relative flow rates , ( b ) injection advance - oxidizer or fuel lead into the chamber and ( c ) initial pressure .
Flow rates close to those that lead to the highest flame temperature would help smoother ignition .
Injection advance is an unavoidable feature of engineering nature .
It will be difficult to ensure simultaneity .
Fuel lead in the case of some fuels can cause an initial fuel rich mixture in some parts of the chamber and some of the fuel rich mix- tures can be explosive in nature .
If these are formed and then full ignition takes place , the explosive mixture may actually detonate .
The classical example is the case of Agena rocket engine using IRFNA / UDMH .
An explosion that resulted due to a restart was traced later to the fuel lead in the start-up sequence .
Generally , in hypergolic systems ( IRFNA or NTO is the oxidizer ) oxidizer lead is recommended .
Typically , this could vary between 30 to 100 ms with ramped flow rate change .
The ambient pressure has a significant influence .
For the first start-up of an engine even at altitude , it is possible to provide a nozzle closure near the throat or down- stream so that the chamber pressure is maintained at a desired pressure , say , 1 atm during the flight of the vehicle up to the time ignition is initiated .
However , for a second ignition that would be demanded in some missions , the start-up occurs at conditions of hard vacuum .
The ignition process involves gas phase reactions and these depend on pressure strongly ( typically like p2 ) .
Longer ignition delays imply sharp pressure rise to values higher than the equilibrium pressure leading to " hard start . "
While the use of additives to reduce the ignition delay was contemplated in the early stages of rocket engine development when the fuels used were not as reactive , most of the hypergolic combinations contemplated in later times ( discussed in section 7.8.2 ) have been so reactive that ignition related problems have been overcome .
There are commonalities and differences between the combustion process in hypergolic propellants and non-hypergolic systems - IRFNA , NTO with UDMH or Aerozine ( an equivolume mixture of hydrazine and UDMH ) belonging to the former class and LOX - RP1 and LOX - LH ; belonging to the second category .
The commonalities are that ( a ) the hot gas mixture is found in the entire chamber due to complex incompressible fluid flow physics , ( b ) drop atomization takes place close to the injector , ( c ) gas phase reactions are very fast due to high chamber pressures , and ( c ) drop vaporization is the rate limiting step .
The differences arise because of possible liquid phase reactions in the case of hypergolic systems , something absent in other cases ; consequently , the heat release rates for hypergolic systems tend to be higher compared to other systems .
The drop density will be very high close to the injector and this density decreases as one goes downstream .
The drops have a high momentum close to the injector and hence , entrain the gas with them .
Downstream , the gas velocity takes over the liquid drop velocity and hence , the liquid drops create drag to the flow .
The drop diameter continues to decrease till it completely vaporizes .
The drop vaporization process has been discussed already in section 6.3.3 in connection with the combustion dynamics of a gas turbine combustor .
Restated , the expression for the vaporization time , ¢ , is given by where dj is the drop diameter , p ; is the liquid density , k , and ¢ , are the gas phase thermal conductivity and specific heat and B. is the Transfer number .
The differences between the processes that occur in a gas turbine and a rocket combustion chamber are several ( see Table 8.1 ) .
As can be noticed , there are some features that are more favorable for rocket engine compared to gas turbine engines , like more reactive fluids , higher peak temperatures and pressures , but unfavorable features like spray density that is one order higher than in a gas turbine engine .
Further , the presence of the recirculation zone in a gas turbine combustor allows the use of the simple expression ( 8.17 ) for estimating the residence time requirements .
In the case of a rocket engine , the liquid drops move with the gas all through till the end of the combustor by which time it is expected that very little has remained un-vaporized .
The multi-phase flow features in which the drops moving at 40 to 100 m / s in the early stages will cause drag to the gaseous flow and subsequently accelerate to the same conditions as the gaseous stream are im- portant in the case of rocket engine .
In the case of a gas turbine engine , part of the combustor is devoted to bringing down the gas temperature to turbine inlet conditions and hence , the combustion process is expected to be completed in a volume smaller than the complete combustor volume .
In the case of rocket engine , the volume - diameter and length - are chosen to achieve as much of vaporization as possible since this feature limits the combustion efficiency .
While gas turbine combustors operate at high pressures at take off and supersonic flight conditions , there are several conditions where they operate at relatively low pressures .
In the case of rocket engines , however , the operating pressure is always high .
The peak temperatures are also much higher .
One can therefore expect the vaporization rates to be higher compared to gas turbine engines .
If we introduce typical values into the terms on the right hand side of equation ( 8.17 ) , we get t , = 25x 10 % d3 , with dp in m and ¢ , in seconds .
A typical 100 micron droplet will require about 6.2.5 ms to vaporise .
The velocity at the throat of the thrust chamber is typically about 1000 m / s .
The velocity at the entry to the nozzle could be between 600 to 800 m / s .
More details on the combustion chamber will be presented in section ( 10.3 ) .
Figure 1.20 shows the details of a hybrid rocket motor .
The oxidizer is typically IRFNA , NTO or LOX .
The fuel block in the case of storable oxidizers will be a special solid that could be hypergolic with these oxidizers or could be a non-hypergolic plastic like polyethylene , polybutadiene or a similar substance .
With LOX , any of these fuels would be satisfactory .
One needs a separate system to start the ignition process .
The flow of the oxidizer past the surface creates a boundary layer and the combustion process occurs as a consequence of turbulent diffusion of the vaporized fuel fragments and the oxidizer into the flame interface .
The heat transfer from the flame vaporizes the fuel .
The mechanism is identical to the erosive burning phenomenon in solid propellants ( see Figure 7.8 ) ; the difference lies in the nature of the condensed phase .
In the present case , it is a non-reactive solid and in the case of solid propellant , it is reactive solid .
The non-reactive solid cannot burn by itself and this gives significant advantage in terms of safety of operations .
The linear regression rate of the fuel is governed by the oxidizer flux through the port and is represented by ρp rhyd = ahydGm where G is the local mass flux through the port ( flow rate per unit port area ) .
Considerable research has been done to determine the values of a and m . The theory of turbulent heat transfer with fuels in which large molecular weight fragments of the basic polymeric material come off from the surface has been worked out ( see Paul et al , [ 60 ] ) and has been shown to com- pare with experimental results .
The correlation provided in this work is rather complex and it is useful to express the result in simpler terms : it is expressed as r _ hyd = 0 : 75 [ Gox = 100 ] 0 : 5 mm / s , where G. , is expressed in kg / m2s for LOX - styrenebutadiene rubber system .
For a 10 tonne thrust engine with a specific impulse of 2500 N s / kg and an O / F of 6.2.0 , the oxidizer flux works out at 1200 kg / m2s at a cross section of 0.6.2.m ?
The initial regression rate works out as 6.2.6 mm / s , a figure about a third of what one would expect in a solid rocket for similar applications .
This implies that the grain geometry has to have a very high surface area for the same port area .
These are the aspects that would need to be taken care in design .
As a matter of comparison , if one considers a large solid rocket motor of 4.5 MN thrust capability ( like PS 1 , see Table 9.7 ) , the mass flow rate is about 1400 kg / s at a cross sectional area of 0.7 m2 amounting to a total mass flux of 2000 kg = m2s .
Equivalently , this implies an oxidizer mass flux of 1330 kg / m2s at an O / F of 2 .
This implies a regression rate of 2.75 mm / s .
The solid propellant burn rate for PS 1 is 9 mm / s .
If one were to design a rocket motor for the same thrust , the burning area needs to be raised by a factor of 3 .
This calls for a grain design that would need multiple ports or in part , addition of an active ingredient like AP to an extent required to raise the burn rate but allowing the propellant itself to remain largely a fuel .
In the case of liquids and hybrid rocket engines , the propellant flow rates ( ri , and iy ) are controlled by an injection pressure ( or manifold pressure , pmanifold ) , chamber pressure , p. and injector geometry .
where cd is the discharge coefficient , typically 0.3 to 0.7 , Ainj is the injector cross sectional area and pj is the density of the liquid .
The mass generation rate increases with p. in the case of solid rocket engine , but decreases for liquids and also for hybrids since the oxidizer fraction of the total flow is significant ( about 65 % ) .
Hence , the question of stability arises in solid rocket engines and limits the pressure index to 1 .
It does not arise in liquid or hybrid rockets ; they are statically stable .
The reason is evident from Figure 8.6 .
There are issues of dynamic stability - coupling between ( a ) energy release processes in the combustion chamber and ( b ) feed system leading to low frequency instability and ( c ) with chamber acoustics leading to high frequency instability that need to be tackled ; these are the subjects of discussion in chapter 11 .
Solid propellant combustion process is significantly chemistry-controlled ; diffusional effects are definitely present , but play a modulatory the speed at which the flame travels into a fuel-oxidant mixture role .
Hence , pressure plays a key role .
Liquid and hybrid propellant combustion processes are diffusion limited , in the former , through liquid vaporization process and in the latter , through boundary layer combustion process .
Hence , pressure plays an indirect and less important role .
In the case of liquid propellant combustion , pressure affects the boiling point and heat of vaporization .
The chamber conditions may be beyond the critical properties of the propellant and in such cases , the lack of a phase boundary may need to be accounted for in the conversion process .
There are also arguments that what matters is the possible non-exceedance of the partial pressure of the propellant in the vapor phase beyond critical value , even if the total pressure is more than the critical pressure .
In any case , it is the diffusion dominated phenomenon and therefore , the reduced importance of the chamber pressure .
The principal effect is that the distance for completing the combustion process is weakly dependent on pressure in the practical range of pressures .
Diffusion limitedness of the combustion in hybrid rockets modulates the influence of pressure .
But any possible structural deformity like a crack or a blow hole has little influence on the pressure-time curve unlike in a solid rocket .
This is because the fuel gasification process is controlled by heat transfer from the gas phase and any parts of the crack that are farther removed from the flame will also receive less heat from the flame and will regress less .
Thus , over some time the opened-up blow hole will get smoothened and any small deviations will reduce with the time of operation .
As a general maxim in science , it is generally understood that if the controlling mechanisms of a process are clear , one would have the ability to control them .
In the case of liquid propellants , controlling the vaporization process is somewhat straight forward - varying the pressure drop across the injector ( given the propellant combination that is usually fixed from considerations of specific impulse ) .
In the case of processes controlled by chemical kinetics like solid propellant combustion , the processes are so complex that even if an understanding of the essential aspects of the behavior is present , controlling the precise outcome by a certain in- put is most difficult .
Substantial efforts to unravel the mechanistic behavior have been made and they have paid rich dividends ; however , the variety of behavior is so vast that capturing all of it is nearly impossible .
The general impression of a solid rocket engine being simple is to be significantly moderated by these fundamental considerations .
Several books provide the information on the relevance of fundamentals of combustion to rocket propulsion .
These are by Williams [ 35 ] , and Mukunda [ 32 ] .
The operation of any rocket motor depends on the mass balance between the gaseous mass generation and exhausting rates .
This states that the chamber gas mass filling rate is the difference between the rate of production of gas and its flow out of the chamber through the nozzle .
The mass production rate of a solid rocket is given by where , Ab is the burning surface area .
The burn rate 7 is dependent on the local chamber static pressure , Pes , the initial temperature , Tin and the local lateral mass flux , all of which are discussed in Chapter 7 .
The nozzle flow rate is obtained from the choked flow anal- ysis presented in Chapter 4 as equation ( 4.31 ) stated as mm = pct Awm / c * .
It must be noted that the nozzle flow rate depends on the chamber stagnation pressure at the entry to the nozzle and the burn rate depends on the local static pressure .
The pressure variation in many rocket motors that are not highly loaded is small enough to let one assume .
This is true with a large number of applications .
This equation states that if a rocket motor is set up with a propellant surface area , A , and nozzle throat area , A ; with the propellant properties of a given c ¢ * , a and n , the equilibrium chamber pressure , pc cqm is given as above .
For a given composition , p , , c * , a and n will be fixed values and the design parameters are A ; and A ; .
The burning area , Ab is dependent on the grain geometry ( discussed in section 9.2 ) .
If one considers a double base propellant or a HMX based composite propellant , the pressure index n is high ~ 0.6 to 0.8 ( see Table 7.14 ) .
The exponent 1 / ( 1 - n ) will be 6.2.5 to 5 .
This is so large that small deviations in any of the parameters - will have very significant , sometimes disastrous consequences to the operation of the rocket motor .
For instance , if there is a minor crack in the propellant increasing the effective surface area by 1 % , the chamber pressure will increase by 6.2.5 to 5 % .
Thus , a propellant with high n and small structural deficiencies could lead to unintended pressure rise and if such a pressure rise is beyond limits , could lead to motor blow-up .
The throat of a solid rocket that uses materials like graphite or carbon-carbon composite will erode with time of operation .
Typically , the throat diameter remains constant for a duration in which the temperature of the backup material increases to levels where the erosion mechanisms come into play .
Typically , the erosion rate is 0.05 to 0.6.2.mm / s depending on the material and the gas phase mass flux past the surface ( it is useful to recall the mechanism of erosive burning ; here too , convective heat transfer affects the erosion rate ) .
Thus , in large motors with throat diameter of 500 to 700 mm , erosion rate of 0.15 mm / s for a typical 100 s burn time implies a throat area variation of 8 to 12 % .
The true implications of the temperature sensitivity can be understood by ex- amining the role of a in the equation ( 9.4 ) .
Typical daily variations could be about 10 to 15 ° C.
However , seasonal variations can go from - 30 to + 50 ° C.
A temperature sensitivity of 0.5 % / K implies that 5 % variation on a daily basis and 40 % variation on a seasonal basis .
The implications on chamber pressure and thrust even on a daily basis are significant and may become unacceptable on a seasonal basis .
While emphasizing the criticality of the initial temperature effect , one moderating influence that must be borne in mind is that all propellants have low conductivity .
Hence , even though ambient temperature varies , there will be weak effects on the core temperature due to size and low conductivity unless the system is soaked at the given condition for a long enough time , typically 24 to 72 hours .
In order to estimate the influence of the parameters , one calculates the fractional change of thrust and chamber pressure with propellant burn area , nozzle throat area and initial temperature .
These are expressed in terms of differentials as in the following equations .
For practical values of n , and or , the influence of variations in burning area , throat area and initial temperature on the changes in chamber pressure and thrust are presented in Table 9.1 .
Any increase in chamber pressure is synonymous with change in burn rate according to dr / 7 = ndp . / p .. This implies a change in burn rate and also burn time with increase in burn rate implying reduction in burn time and vice versa .
In constructing this table , it must be noted that only small variations around a nominal point are considered .
If the variations are large the basic equations ( 9.5 and 9.6 ) need to be used to calculate the changes .
The very significant variations in chamber pressure and thrust due to larger n are very clear from this table .
The coupled effects of even 10 ° C change on the thrust and chamber pressure can be very significant .
These are unacceptable for operation in many tactical missions .
One strategy that is adopted would be to change the throat area when the ambient temperature changes consistently for a minimum period of time .
Figure 9.1 shows a central plug that can be moved backward and forward to control the throat area .
In summer , when the initial temperature is large , the throat area is increased .
Equation ( 9.6 ) can be manipulated to show that such an area variation must fol- low A ; x explor ( Tn - T , ) / n ] to ensure constant pressure and thrust .
While it may be too difficult to completely offset the temperature effect , the influence may be restricted by changing the area by the scheme indicated here .
In some cases , particularly short range missiles , the entire system is maintained in air conditioned environment with both the temperature and humidity control .
9.1.1 Stability of Motor Operation The mass balance equation ( 9.2 ) can be rewritten by invoking the equation of state where p , is the density of the gases in the chamber = p . / RT , .
Figure 9.1 : A rocket motor for tactical applications with facility for varying the throat .
Notice that by moving the object back and forth using the central screw , one can vary the minimum cross section of the fluid passage and thus , control A , o £ .
Its spread in practical situations is 8 to 15 kg / m ? .
The question of stability is posed thus - It is known that at equilibrium , the right hand side is 0 .
At this condition , if a momentary change in parameters takes place through A , , A ; , or ¢ * , would there be a tendency for the motor operation to return to equilibrium or move away from it .
We consider the case of the pressure exponent , n > 1 and n < 1 as two important cases , since this parameter decides the rate of change of mass generated with respect to nozzle outflow rate when pressure is perturbed .
For n < 1 , the curve droops ( see A in Figure 9.2 ) and for n > 1 , it sharply rises as indicated by B in the figure .
Now consider a slight decrease in p. through one of the several parameters .
For the case n < 1 , this leads to a situation where the mass production rate is larger than the mass flow rate through the nozzle .
Hence , there is a tendency for pressure to increase .
This implies that the operation is stable .
This argument holds good even if there is an increase in pressure .
The mass flow rate through the nozzle is slightly higher than the mass generation rate and hence , pressure drops .
For the case of n > 1 , when pressure rises as indicated in B , the effect is that the production rate is larger than mass outflow rate and hence , there is a tendency for pressure to rise further .
This tendency leads to explosion .
Hence , the stability criterion is that n < 1 .
If the term involving p. is taken into account in the first term on the right hand side of equation 9.14 , this condition becomes n < 1 / ( 1 - p . / p , ) .
This implies that the critical limit is pushed to a value slightly in excess of 1 .
For most motor operations , the recommendation is to stay much below n = 1 .
This is the reason why low values of n are preferred for the propellant .
Equation ( 9.14 ) can be expressed in a non-dimensional form .
We note the equi- librium pressure , p.m is given by setting the right hand side to 0 as in equation ( 9.3 ) .
It is necessary to note that the propellant ignition process involves separate ignition composition with a certain mass and energy .
For the present purpose , it is sufficient to note that time = 0 corresponds to the completion of the ignition process during which period ( that lasts 10 ms to 50 ms depending on the size of the rocket motor ) , the chamber pressure achieved is the ignition pressure , p . ; . , ( ignition transients need to be separately considered and will be discussed subsequently ) .
In actuality if one takes approach to 95 % p. cm , the time taken will be a realistic representation .
The quantity L * in the equation ( 9.17 ) has relevance in motor operation .
It occurs both in solid and liquid rockets .
Typical values of L * in small solid motors is about 0.8 to 1.5 m and in large boosters could be as high as 40 m . It increases from a minimum value at start and reaches a maximum at the end .
Its significance in solid rockets is related to low frequency instability like chuffing that occurs in low chamber pressure motors and during start-up if the ignition energy is inadequate .
Typical value of tc is 1.5 to 2.ms in small motors and 2. to 40 ms in large motors .
Its significance is related to achieving of complete combustion in rocket engines .
Aluminum oxidation to aluminum oxide takes the longest time , typically about 5 to 6.2. ms .
exceeds this magnitude , the combustion efficiency achieved in large rocket motors is close to 99 % with realized specific impulse efficiency exceeding 93 % , the loss of 7 % being due to a combination of chemical kinetics , two phase and wall frictional losses .
When the propellant is burnt up completely , A ; = 0 and hence , the pressure is controlled by the nozzle flow rate alone .
Figure 9.3 indicates the three simple geometries indicative of the broad burning behavior of propellants .
If 4 ; is constant as in an end burning grain [ Figure 9.3 ( a ) , pressure will be constant .
Such a characteristic is called " neutral " burning characteristic .
If a cylindrical grain that burns from inside is considered [ Figure 9.3 ( b ) ] , the burning area in- creases with time till the outer surface is reached and hence , the pressure keeps increasing with time .
This configuration is termed " progressive " burning .
If a cylindrical grain burning only from outside is considered [ Figure 9.3 ( c ) ] , then the burning area decreases with the time of burning and hence , pressure decreases with time .
Such an arrangement is termed " regressive " burning .
These are the fundamental geometric features that will be exhibited by any choice of geomet- ric configuration of the propellant .
In fact , even in one propellant geometry one could have a combination of neutral and progressive , neutral and regressive , or regressive and progressive modes of combustion .
Figure 9.3 : The end burning grain ( a ) , the circular internal burning grain ( b ) and an outside-to-inside burning cylindrical grain ( c )
As different from this condition , a " boost " mode in which high thrust for short duration occurs is demanded in the first stage of missile flight during which period , the missile accelerates to high speeds , gener- ally higher than the speed of the target it is supposed to chase .
After this condition , a period of " sustain " mode is needed to ensure that the guidance system tracks the target and reaches it to neutralize it .
To obtain high thrust , one needs to have larger A , .
This is obtained from internal-external burning or internal burning geometry .
Figure 9.4 shows the variety of geometries used for such applications .
They can be classified into ( a ) side burning two-dimensional configurations and ( b ) three- dimensional configurations .
A side inhibited hollow cylinder burning radially both from inside and outside represents a neutral burning configuration .
Allowing the sides also to burn is a three dimensional configuration with regressive character- istic .
For a long tube , the three-dimensional effect is small .
A rod-in-a-cylinder burning along radial direction alone or including the sides is another alternative to obtain even higher surface area with enhanced regressivity .
If an inside burn- ing cylinder is used , the initial burning area is wd ; , L , where d ; , and L are the initial diameter and length respectively .
In many situations one would need an area much larger than can be provided within this length .
Higher surface area is obtained by wrinkling the internal surface like a star , wagon wheel or a similar geometry shown in Figure 9.4 .
This enhances the perimeter three to four fold and hence , the area as well .
This is why a star or wagon wheel burning geometry is extensively used .
In select missile applications , to match the high loading density and the length- to-diameter ratio , one uses three-dimensional geometries like slotted tube ( a tube that has slots over a part of the length ) cone-in-a-cylinder ( conocyl ) or fin-in-a- cylinder ( finocyl ) , spherical motor with internal slots , all of which are shown in Figure 9.5 .
In order to understand how the burning area varies when the propellant burns , we examine two cases - an inside burning square and a star .
Figure 9.6 shows the two configurations .
It is first recognized that every propellant burns along a local normal .
Therefore , the segment AB of the square port will become A ' B ' with no change in the length and each corner will evolve into a quarter of a circle - like point A becoming A ' A , " etc .
The latter occurs because , the corner point has to move equal radial distance and this leads to a part of a circle .
This is the maximum change in the perimeter that would be possible in a two-dimensional configuration as any burning surface will ultimately become circular as time advances .
The evolution of a pointed star as combustion proceeds is shown in Figure 9.6 .
The surface generated by the segment AB will evolve into

Figure 9.7 shows such a segment .
There are two geometric parameters controlling the geometry - n , the number of star points and 6 , the angle between the star segments at the star point .
We need to obtain the increments in burning length now .
We first obtain the different angles that depend on 7 / n , and 6 / 6.2.that control the geometry .
These are indicated in the Figure 9.7 .
Figure 9.5 : The spherical ( a ) , Fin-in-a-cylinder or Finocyl ( b ) and Cone-in-a-cylinder ( Conocyl ) three dimensional configurations
Figure 9.7 : A typical star segment showing the different phases of burning
This transcendental equation is solved to obtain # ( n ) denoted by 0 , neutral .
Thus , through the choice of suitable 0 , one can obtain all the three modes of combustion .
It can be seen from Figure 9.7 that when point B " is reached , the segment contributing to decrease in area will be completely burnt up .
This increase will go on till the point A " is reached .
This constitutes the outer wall - could be the beginning of insulation / inhibition segment .
Till this point , the combustion area is in progressive mode from the point the possibility of the three modes ( implying neutral , progressive and regressive ) is lost ( Point B " ) .
This wall layer is called sliver fraction .
In several motor operations , it will not burn due to sudden decrease of pressure to much lower values that occur due to reduction in the burning area , particularly when propellants with large pressure index are used .
One of the objectives of grain design is to reduce the sliver fraction .
If the propellant burns to longer web thickness in the regime be- yond B , " the shape of the profile will be closer to the outer circle and the sliver fraction will be lower even though the burning area keeps increasing .
This behavior is simply due to the fact that a circle drawn with O as the center and A as the center ( see Figure 9.7 ) become close to each other at radius large compared to the distance OA .
The question of sliver fraction is important for rocket motors using case bonded double base propellants as in tactical motor applications .
For cartridge loaded systems , the grain geometry will be such that the propellant will burn up from all sides or at least radially from outside as well as inside .
In this case , it is possible that some propellant fragments may remain unburnt due to small changes in burn rates locally and this cannot be dealt with by geometric changes .
In launch vehicles , the lower stages are generally large size motors with reasonable loading .
This implies that the propellant outer radius will be larger compared to the distance between the centers discussed above .
In rocket motors used for upper stages ( that operate at high altitudes ) using composite propellants with low pressure index , say < 0.4 , the motor will continue to cause efflux of gases from the insulating material and propellant remaining unburnt due to the heat stored in them after the combustion of the major portion of the propellant .
This maintains chamber pressures that are low but much higher than the ambient ( that is under hard vacuum ) .
This implies that all the propellant will burn up and the issue of sliver fraction is not a vital aspect .
Two-dimensional geometries involving star , wagon wheel and other simple de- signs can be analyzed analytically for the perimeter and the port area as a func- tion of the web burnt .
The results will invariably be in the form of trigonometric functions for the different phases of combustion ( initial part for which one can get neutral , regressive or progressive modes ) and a later phase which is always progressive .
Figure 9.8 shows the plot of the perimeter and Figure 9.9 shows the port area and the sliver area for the case of n = 6 .
Depending on the web chosen , one can obtain both the quantities .
To aid design , figures like these are generated for a variety of geometric parameters .
Three-dimensional geometries are the slotted tube , conocyl , finocyl , spherical motor with internal slots at various orientations like in Figure 9.5 and other sim-
It must be understood that while conceiving these geometries is simple , to ensure that they can be realized in practice through a meaningful casting procedure is not trivial .
Calculation of the burning area with web requires computer based strategies .
One such strategy involves covering the surface with a large number of points in an appropriate coordinate system and allowing each point to regress a certain distance along the local nor- mal and identifying the collection of such points as a new surface .
This process is continued until some portions are completely consumed and the points disappear .
Even such a procedure takes a long time for computation .
It is suggested that standard contour plot routines can be used gainfully in computing the surface and port areas .
When grain design is performed in practice , one can obtain neutral burning behavior over a certain web burnt region for applications involving the various configurations discussed above .
The extent of neutrality of these geometries is presented in Table 9.3 .
Figure 9.9 : The normalized port area and sliver area as a function of burnt distance
In reality , maintaining structural integrity of the rocket motor casing as well as the propellant is connected to the choice of the burning configuration .
To understand the forces on the motor and the propellant , one must appreciate the flight acceleration profile .
Most rocket motors experience acceleration during the flight , both longitudinal and lateral .
Typical values are presented in Table 9.4 .
While all large size motors , particularly the motors for launch vehicles use case bonded grains , the motors for tactical military applications use cartridge loading ( free standing grains ) .
The acceleration of the first stage of large strategic or space vehicles is usually low at start to keep the acceleration that increases till burn-out within limits .
In the upper stages , the thrust demanded is lower and hence , the changes in acceleration between that at start and propellant burn-out will not be large .
Starting acceleration of space launch vehicles is smaller than for military vehicles because of the freedom in the time of launch of space vehicles something that cannot be allowed for military applications ( the reason is that early flight path can be affected considerably due to wind speeds and higher vehicle acceleration reduces the wind effects ) .
To explain this point further , if we take a progressive grain configuration , the chamber pressures will increase continuously during the burn duration .
The rocket motor casing has to be designed for it to withstand the peak operating pressure as per standard design codes .
Such a motor will reside at pressures lower than the design most of the time and yet will have larger casing thickness and weight .
Rocket Motor Operation 327 largely regressive grain will cause similar issues .
In motors that are accelerating significantly with reasonable structural loads on the propellant - casing interface , a mildly regressive grain could be beneficial .
Thus , one needs to combine the struc0tural efficiency with structural integrity to arrive at an optimal solution .
If one sets down what one desires from a propellant-propulsion system , they are ( a ) high propellant loading , ( b ) near neutral burning , ( c ) low total weight , and ( d ) low sliver losses .
The high propellant loading will help accommodate the pro- pellant inside a smaller envelop ( diameter ) so that the vehicle weight is brought down .
This leads to a design with the port area comparable to the throat area .
In such a situation , there will be erosive burning effects and substantial stagna- tion pressure difference between the head and aft end .
This will cause additional compressive forces on the grain .
Coupled with lateral acceleration , it could lead to structural failure of the propellant .
In motor development , there have been many cases of this nature when high propellant loading density has been sought .
Hence , there arises a need to restrict the loading density .
The other aspects ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) have been discussed earlier .
Thus , propellant design will need to be a compromise amongst various desirable features .
Large motors have settled down to the propellant design with an " M " curve for pressure-time , in which the pressure has two peaks , one at the early time and another towards the tail end .
The key aspect in these and other similar designs is to ensure that the ratio of the peak pressure to the mean pressure is not large , since it is this ratio that decides the structural efficiency of the casing .
When the ignition system of a loaded rocket motor is started up , the motor fires and the pressure measured by a transducer mounted on the head end will appear as shown in Figure 9.10 .
The first part of the pressure rise is due to the com- bination of igniter mass burn up and the mass of burnt gas generated from the combustion of the ignited propellant surface .
Typically , about 30 % pressure rise is contributed by the igniter mass and subsequent pressure rise is due to the pro- pellant itself .
Usually , there will be a pressure peak at the end of this rise and the pressure drops to equilibrium value that can remain constant , increase or de- crease depending on the burning area variation with time till a moment when the propellant has burnt up .
Since all the propellant will not burn up simultaneously , there is a rate of pressure drop associated with the burn of the last fragments .
It may also happen that some pieces that are still burning could be thrown out of the rocket motor through the nozzle since these burning masses move through the fluid towards the nozzle during the course of the burn-up .
The pressure finally drops down to the ambient pressure after the burn-up of the propellant .
Action time is the time between the 10 % maximum pressure at the point of pressure rise to a similar point along the pressure decay line .
Action time is always more than the burning time .
For small sliver non-erosive burn profile , the two times will differ by no more than 2 % .
For highly loaded propellant configuration , and / or those with large sliver loss , the two will differ by as much as 4 to 6 % .
This is illustrated in Figure 9.11 ( a ) and ( b ) .
While the ignition peak drops off fast in the case of a motor with no erosive burning , the peak drops off slowly when erosive burning is significant .
Also , the tail-off is much slower since the burning profile would have caused some portions to be consumed when the significant pressure drop begins .
The actual shape of the burning profile in both cases ( with and without erosive burning ) is shown in Figure 9.11 ( a ) .
The nozzle end portions affected by large convective heat transfer burn up at a faster rate compared to the head end segments leading to an axially non-uniform profile variation in comparison to the non-erosive case where the combustion is uniform .
While designing rocket motors whether progressively or regressively burning , one uses the equilibrium relation ( 9.3 ) to obtain p. vs.
Given a geometric configuration , one can calculate Ab vs. y .
From equation ( 9.3 ) one can get pc vs y since at every y , one knows Ab .
Thus , one obtains pc vs t .
With progressive mode of operation , since pc will vary significantly with time , a question that may arise is : Would the use of equilibrium relation ignoring the unsteady term be justified under these circumstances ?
To answer this , one should compute the ratio of the left hand side term to one of the terms on the right hand side of equation ( 9.14 ) and examine the magnitude .
If this ratio is large , one cannot ignore the left hand side term .
To get an estimate of the ratio Rtr , we make use of a hollow circular cylinder burning from inside as it represents the asymptotic profile in the burning profile of a propellant with any internally burning two-dimensional geometry .
Thus , even for the highest pressure rise rate , the unsteady filling term dmy / dt constitutes about 1.5 % .
That is why equilibrium estimation of chamber pressure is quite accurate .
Of course , this condition will not be obeyed during the starting transient and the tail-off .
Under these conditions , one needs to account for the chamber gas mass filling term on the left hand side .
9.4 Ignition System and Process Igniters have several components .
The first component is an initiator .
This transfers the energy to the main charge through a thermo-chemical process .
Many variants of initiation systems have been built to help safe and sure operation .
The initiation systems are electrical , mechanical shock wave , laser or semiconductor bridge .
The electrical system could be hot wire initiator or exploding bridge wire initiator .
The hot wire initiator has been used for a long time and is a work horse even now .
The first component of this is a squib .
Figure 9.12 shows the elements of a squib .
This is a bridge wire of nichrome that gets heated on the passage of an electric current .
There is a no-fire current , an all-fire current and a recommended fire current .
Typically these are 0.1 , 1 , and 0.5 amps respectively .
Around the squib is placed the primer .
As soon as the bridge wire gets red hot , the primer material ( mercuric fulminate or lead azide ) will explode .
These together weigh 50mg - -1g and will burn up in less than 5 ms .
This energy is picked up by a transfer charge , a booster charge and a main charge in sequence .
The transfer charge consists of 0.5 to 5 g of powder or granules ( 1 - 3 mm size ) .
Since material is in powder form , it picks up the energy from the squib fast enough and holds the fire for about 5 to 10 ms before the booster charge takes over .
Figure 9.12 : Details of a squib used in pyrotechnic igniters , adapted from ref . [ 22 ]
Figure 9.14 : The pyrogen igniter system with safe-arm facility
Their weight is dictated by the motor free volume and the pressure that is intended to be built up - typically between 30 to 40 % of the equilibrium pressure ( just at the end of the ignition transient ) .
Figure 9.13 and 9.14 show the details of three classes of igniters - basket , jet and pyrogen .
The basket igniter is the simplest and used in many small motor applications .
It is robust even though it is heavy .
Its operation allows smooth pressure rise .
For larger size motors , one adopts the jet igniter assembly .
It would also be possible to provide jets in several directions to reach all parts of the burning surface .
The pyrogen ignition system shown in Figure 9.14 is a small rocket motor with the grain composition meant for igniters as discussed in section 7.7 .
This itself has an ignition system usually more elaborate than squib-transfer-booster-main charge strategy .
This is because the igniter is used in large motors .
The exit of this pyrogen motor can also have multiple holes for the hot particle laden jets to issue and cause a number of hot spot ignition points .
The dynamics of ignition of large motors is controlled by the fluid flow processes .
The donor charge is exploded usually with flexible detonating fuse in about a microsecond .
The shockwave from the donor charge is transmitted through the metal body into the acceptor charge that ignites the pyro-charge .
The gases from the pyro-charge can ignite the propellant in the pyrogen igniter assembly .
This system is combined with safe / arm devices in duplicate to provide for redundancy .
The safe position isolates the firing lines from the initiators carried in the safe / arm device and also misalign the explosive train until " arm " is energized .
The laser device consists of a laser firing system , a communicating fiber-optic line through a sealed optical window into the explosive material .
Short wave length laser beams ( ~ 0.3 pum ) cause initiation of the explosive by bond breaking and long wave length beams ( ~ 1 pm ) cause local heating that can be enhanced by using better heat absorbing materials like carbon .
These systems awaiting exploitation are considered " highly safe " because they are tolerant to a number of incidents like electrostatic discharge and radio frequency disturbances .
The semi-conductor bridge type consists of a doped poly-silicon layer formed on a silicon substrate on a metallic surface acting as a conductor of electricity .
A current pulse through the system causes the bridge to burst into a bright plasma discharge in microseconds transferring energy to the main charge .
This is also tolerant to disturbances like the laser device .
All solid rocket motor systems using any one of the initiators and main charge pyrotechnic compositions in pellets-in-a-basket or pyrogen motor need to fulfill
These are ( 1 ) The time delay between the ignition pulse ( electric command ) and 10 % pressure rise point as well as time interval between 10 % to 90 % pressure rise should be within a specified limit ( typically 30 to 100 ms depending on the motor size ) .
These have effect on the exit nozzle operation ( severely over-expanded for the period before the exit pressure exceeds 30 % of the ambient pressure ) leading to unsteadiness in thrust .
( 2 ) The pressure rise rate ( dpc / dt ) should not be so high as to cause shock loads on the propellant affecting its structural integrity .
( 3 ) Minimization of hardware weight and volume particularly in small tactical motors since the inert mass can become significant fraction of the total mass of the motor .
The key feature of the igniter , namely , the weight of the main charge ( wig ) is obtained from the requirement that it should have some solids fraction ( sf ) and the hot gaseous component attain a certain chamber pressure inside the motor ( the entire free volume of the chamber , usually taken up to the throat ) .
This equation is simply the equation of state for the gaseous fraction of the products at the end of the ignition phase .
The more energetic composition using Boron ( 6.2 .. 5 % ) , Potassium Nitrate ( 69.0 % ) and Poly ethyl cellulose ( 6.2.5 % ) gives products at 7 , = 3535 K with composition involving liquid boron ( 36 % ) and gaseous products as follows ( by volume ) : BO = 0.140 , N , = 0.103 , KBO ; = 0.125 , BO , = 0.055 , CO = 0.055 , HBO = 0.035 , Hy " = 0.017 , H = 0.012 and B ; 03 = 0.01 .
Equation ( 9.30 ) is satisfactory for motors that are not long .
In case of large motors ( that are usually long - 20 to 40 m ) , the free volume is large ( 20 to 40 m3 ) one needs to consider the aero-thermo-chemical dynamics to enable predict the pressure - time curve .
Data on several tactical motors as well as large motors used for strategic or launch vehicle applications are shown in Table 9.5 .
It can be seen from this table , tactical motors use a igniter weight-to-free volume ratio of about 7 - 8 kg / m3 ( excepting for tactical motor T-2 , in which case , the propellant is stated to be a fuel rich solid propellant difficult to ignite and so , larger igniter weight is needed to cause a smooth ignition ) .
In the case of large motors , the igniter weight used is much smaller in proportion to the free volume .
This is due to the fact that
The total ignition process can be split into ignition of all of the propellant surface that actually calls for a flame spreading process from the head end to the aft end and the chamber filling process in which the gas has to fill in entire free volume to equilibrium values .
The ignition of all segments occurs by a flame spreading process .
For a 35 m long motor , if we take that the flame spread occurs in 400 ms , the spread rate amounts to 90 m / s .
This spread rate is not uniform .
It starts off at about 10 m / s in the early ignition time and accelerates to 150 m / s towards the propellant end segment .
One of the key features would be the time for which igniter has to keep firing .
In the case of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle ( PSLV , India ) and Space Shuttle - Solid Rocket Booster ( SS-SRB , USA ) , the igniter firing time is about 600 ms .
Attempts to bring this down to 300 ms to increase the pressure rise rate of the motor are in progress in advanced versions of these systems .
Strategic vehicles like IRBM and ICBM are designed for a wide horizontal range to enable a class of targets be accessible to a set of vehicles .
The launch involves the setting of parameters for the payload to be launched at a specific point in space or on earth or under water with a specific velocity ( including the vector ) so that subsequent ballistic path will lead the warhead to the target .
Great accuracies of the position and velocity are required to ensure little errors in reaching the target ( low Circular Error Probability , as the usual terminology treats it ) .
Since the same vehicle will need to be positioned at different locations in space depending on the distance of the target from the launch point , it is essential to have a strategy to terminate the thrust of the vehicle at a point close to the location at which the ballistic trajectory begins .
The strategy used to terminate the thrust is the process of extinction of the burning propellant caused by sharp de-pressurization .
The strategy for causing extinction lies in suddenly increasing At so that the equilibrium pressure is brought down .
