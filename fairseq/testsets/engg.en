This is the second edition of the book "Understanding combustion".
The first book was written in 1986-1987 time frame.
When this book was published, it was not clear what the response of the readers would be.
Fortunately, there was positive feed back on the readability of the book from several unexpected quarters, both academic and industrial.
This has been the motivation to amend and add chapters for a slightly more comprahensive book that aims to give a reader the essence of the subject and enable him to launch into reading other books written in greater detail meant more for a professional.
Even though the essentials have remained the same, much has happened in the subject in the intervening period — rising cost of fossil fuels has been a serious issue arising out of peaking of the liquid fossil fuel availability across the world.
We have burnt up much more than we can sustainably produce.
Solid fuels like coal do not belong to this category yet.
Efforts to develop and use renewable liquid fuels like biofuels and other solid fuels including urban solid waste brought up by indiscriminate urbanization should be on the rise.
Hence, there is no escape from combustion either at home, in the office or during travel — on ground, in air or space.
Three new chapters added to this book are: Gasification of solid fuels, Emission of pollutants, and explosion and detonation.
The developments in gasification in the last twenty years have been the primary motivation for including the subject of gasification.
It is anticipated that it will come into vogue in all parts of world, more particularly the developing world in the coming two decades in very significant way.
The other two subjects were missed out earlier and have therefore been included now to ensure greater awareness among the readers.
It is for these reasons that detailed referencing of original papers is not done.

Oxidizer?
4.2 How Do We Compute the Composition? .
4.3 How Do We Obtain Flame Temperature
In nature, fire must have been caused due to wind-swayed dry branches of trees rubbing over one another or by lava from an active volcano igniting wood or dry grass in its path.
The primitive human witnessing these must have felt awed by the heat and light of the fire and may have run away from it at first and later perhaps bowed before it in respect.
That is how the fire God—“Agni Bhagavan” was born.
Combustion, to a large class of users of firewood for cooking, means putting together solid pieces of fuel wood, igniting it with the modern equivalent of the flint stone, the match stick.
A bit of kerosene is sometimes sprinkled on the wood to get the fire going quickly.
The flame is then maintained by adding fuel pieces or rearranging the pieces already introduced.
More than five hundred million homes in the world depend on solid bio-fuels for cooking.
Another class of users, largely urban, uses liquefied petroleum gas.
Lighting of a gas stove is a much simpler process; one just opens the valve in the gas stove and uses a spark igniter or sometimes a matchstick.
But a steady flame is sustained afterwards.
The use of fire is not confined to cooking alone; humans have found a plethora of uses for it, especially after the industrial revolution.
In creating new materials,
1 Why Should One Attempt to Understand Combustion?
for instance, heat generated by fire is used to melt ores or create new alloys from metals.
Coal, the natural product arising out of a million years of compression of plant material under the earth, is the mainstay of combustion in such cases.
Natural gas, another fuel available in some parts of the globe, for example in Assam and Gujarat in India, is used as a fuel in engines to generate motive or statinary power and in some instances for high temperature chemical processes.
Oils like diesel or gasoline are burnt in reciprocating engines of the compression- ignition kind or the spark-ignition kind to generate power for stationary applica- tions as well as for purposes of traction.
The Aviation Industry that has developed at a fantastic pace in the last hundred years, uses kerosene oil in its engines, mostly the gas turbine engines.
The hot gases expand in a turbine to generate power that is used for compressing the in- coming air and the residual power runs a propeller to provide the propulsive power to the airplane.
There are other class of engines that expand the hot high pres- sure gases in a nozzle into the atmosphere to create high speed jets; this process generates thrust.
And in the last forty years, going beyond the earth’s atmosphere using rockets has become a fact.
The rockets burn exotic chemicals at high pressure in a small chamber.
The hot gases so generated are expanded into the atmosphere through nozzles.
To light a kerosene stove, outer perforated sheets around the wicks are first removed and the wicks are ignited.
If now, the outer perforated sheet is replaced, a nice bluish flame will become stabilized in the annular region, occasionally with bluish buttons of flames around the holes in the perforated sheet.
Such an elegant simple combustion device it is, a question arises as to whether alternate strategies for burning kerosene can be conceived?
The only other design is that of a pressure stove which heats up kerosene in the flame zone itself and issues it out as a gas jet.
The jet of kerosene vapor entrains the air around and burns up in a near-blue turbulent flame.
It may be difficult to appreciate that in order to design such a system, the geometric parameters must be chosen carefully so that the duct carrying the kerosene does not burn up or the resulting flame is from trickling drops.
The gas turbine engine combustion chamber that burns kerosene is even more
The requirement are to burn the fuel and oxidizer under lean conditions (fuel fraction less than the correct proportion for combustion to be complete) at high pressure to provide a relatively uniform high temperature profile at the exit cross- section of the combustion chamber and limit the emissions of undesirable products of combustion, namely, unburnt hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitro- gen.
That all these requirements have been met with in the last four decades with in- creasing index of performance is an evidence to progress in the understanding of the processes and the use of all the advanced design tools.
The liquid fuels, in some situations, vaporise and combust with air as in kerosene stoves.
In some others, like in a furnace or gas turbine combustor, the liquid fu- els are sprayed through injectors and the fine droplets burn up in an oxidizer-rich environment.
In solid propellants, wherein oxidizer and fuel are in close proxim- ity, combustion takes place at high pressure.
The propellant components react in condensed phase (solid/liquid), vaporise and react exothermally in gas phase, and transfer heat back to the condensed phase to sustain the combustion process.
At the very root of these processes is the fact that a flame is produced because the flowing system has the fuel vapour and oxidizer mixing in the right propor- tions, chemically reacting to release heat which becomes the sustaining element for continued reactions.
In some instances the fuel and oxidizer are mixed before reac- tions take place.
These are termed ‘premixed flames’ (e.g., kerosene wick stove).
There is therefore a need to understand the interaction between the fluid flow and the chemical reaction un- der various conditions of temperature, pressure, and ways of mixing the fuel and the oxidizer to appreciate and design various devices — wood stove, a reciprocating engine combustion system, a gas turbine combustor, or a rocket engine combustor.
The motivation for understanding combustion to design combustion systems arises from two considerations: (i) the systems are too complex to be understood easily and trial and error techniques of design simply do not work and (ii) the sys- tems are so large that trial and error techniques are far too expensive to practice.
One important approach to understanding is dimensionless analysis.
Much has been said about dimensionless numbers in engineering literature.
The most power- ful and simple tool to understand, explain and predict the behaviour of engineering systems including chemical systems is the method of dimensionless analysis.
There are more powerful methods which involve the solution of conservation equations of mass, momentum, energy and species which lead to accurate predic- tions of behaviour of chemical-engineering systems.
However, useful information in many cases can be extracted from dimensional analysis referred to above.
A better understanding does not always imply generation of a design procedure.
1 Why Should One Attempt to Understand Combustion?
It gives an insight into the way things work and hence significantly reduces the dependence on the trial and error technique.
Fuels and oxidizers can be in gaseous, liquid, solid form.
They undergo exothermic reactions under a variety of conditions — from those at near ambient pressure and those at very high pressures.
They result in high temperature gases that travel at low speeds (called deflagrations) or at very high speeds (called detonations).
The main aim of combustion is to release the energy of the fuels by reacting with suitable oxidizers into sensible heat such that the efficiency of combustion as high as possible (close to 100 % in many instances) and the undesirable emissions are at a minimum.
The broad spectrum of conditions under which combustion is per- formed calls for a fundamental understanding of various effects.
In this endeavour, both fluid mechanics and chemical thermodynamics are needed.
To signify this, the field of combustion is some times referred to as aero-thermo-chemistry.
To achieve an understanding of the subject, experimental data and analytical tools of varying complexity are needed.
This book addresses the simplest of the approaches to the understanding of the phenomena.
We burn fuels for two major purposes: (i) for generating heat for cooking, melting metals, heat treatment etc.
and (ii) for generating power—Ilike in internal combus- tion reciprocating and rotating machinery or for generating work or force like in air breathing and rocket engines.
The sensitivity of systems to the nature of fuel is much more in those cases where power/ work /force (like in case (ii)) is demanded than in the case of heat requirements (as in case (i)).
Unfortunately, this fact is not greatly appreciated and there are several examples where fuels meant for engines are used for heating purposes as well.
Fuels can be classified into gaseous, liquid and solid forms and some are listed in Table 2.1.
Liquified petroleum gas (LPG), the first of the fuels in Table 2.1 is a product of petroleum refining.
It is used as cooking gas in most urban areas in India.
It is also used as a transport fuel in three- and four-wheelers.
Its name is a bit strange in that it starts with a liquid and ends in a gas.
The cylinder contains a liquid which can be actually checked by shaking it.
On opening the top valve, one gets gas.
A cylinder of about 35 litres (which you can compute based on dimensions measured) contains about 15 kg of LPG (Fig.
2.1).
Typically, the pressure inside the cylinder is about 0.6 M Pa (note that the at- mospheric pressure at sea level is approximately 0.1 M Pa; it is 0.101325 M Pa exactly) i.e., the pressure is about 6 times the ambient pressure.
This pressure depends on ambient temperature.
If the ambient temperature falls below —10°C, which is common in winter in some northern areas of India close to the Himalayas, the valve may be opened and one would get very little gas (after the cylinder has experienced the temperature for about a day or so, for it takes quite some time for the cold to penetrate the cylinder).
Biomass like firewood, Air Domestic heat, Furnaces, En- sawdust, rice husk, gines with gasifiers 2.
example of elementary physics where it is stated that lentil (dal) cooks well at sea level but poorly at high altitudes, this being related to lower boiling point at higher altitudes).
Liquid petroleum gas is composed of a few chemical species like propane and butane which are composed of the chemical elements C and H.
Therefore it is gas at ambient temperature.
As pressure reaches 0.6 M Pa, the boiling point is raised to 26°C.
If the ambient temperature is 20°C but the pressure 0.6 M Pa, you see that Butane has to be in liquid form.
If ambient temperature reaches 35°C, then the pressure inside the cylinder will become 0.8 M Pa and both liquid and gas exist in equilibrium.
At typical draw rates of the gas in cooking stoves—0.03-0.05 g/s (108— 180 g/h).
However, if you draw much larger flow rates—something which can be done in a combustion laboratory and should be avoided at home—the cooling effect dominates and the pressure in the cylinder will begin to fall.
Consequently, water drops form on the outer surface of the cylinder due to condensation of atmospheric moisture, reducing the gas flow drastically.
The composition of LPG depends on the source of the crude used for refining and the effort put into refining it.
Table 2.2 shows a typical composition and density of LPG.
Notice that it is much lighter than water, in fact close to half of it.
Next we take up biogas.
Biogas is produced by anaerobic digestion of biomass.
Its use has gone up significantly in the last decade, and in several parts of India,
Table 2.2: Composition of fuels (HHC = Higher hydrocarbons) Substance Density Composition (%) LPG (liquid) 540-560 C3H6 = 18, C,H;( = 80, HHC-rest Biogas 1.1-1.2 CH, =60-80, CO, = 40-20 Producer gas (wood) 0.9-1.2 CO = 16-20, H, = 16-18, CO, = 8- Blue water gas 0.65 H, = 50, CO = 40, CO, = 6, N, and Coke oven gas 0.40 H, =54, CH, =24,CO =8, CO, = 6, large rural households now have biogas plants based on cow dung.
The cow dung, which has several microbes in it, is mixed with water and allowed to settle in a sealed container with space above the liquid for the gas to collect.
The microbes attack the biomass and generate a gas composed largely of methane and carbon dioxide.
A typical composition of biogas is given in Table 2.2.
The gas stoves that run on biogas are similar to the LPG gas stoves used for cooking purposes.
Biogas can also be used to run gasoline (spark ignition) engines as well as diesel (compression ignition) engines in a dual fuel mode, i.e., in a mode in which both gasoline diesel and biogas are used as fuels (largely biogas).
Producer gas is a product of oxidation — reduction reactions of air with biomass.
Oxidation results in products of combustion like carbon dioxide and water.
This is because biomass is chemically composed of elements C, H, O and some N.
The gases that are at high temperature due to partial oxidation pass through a bed of charcoal (which is produced because of oxidation reaction it- self) and the reduction reaction of these gases with carbon leads to carbon monoxide and hydrogen.
Nitrogen gas can be treated as inert in all these situations except for the generation of pollutants like oxides of nitrogen.
There are other variants of combustible gases called blue water gas, coke oven gas, coke producer gas and blast furnace gas all produced as a result of oxidation — reduction reactions of coal or coke with air (and steam sometimes).
In the second group of fuels listed in Table 2.1 we have liquid fuels.
The first five liquids, namely gasoline, HSD, LDO, furnace oil and kerosene are products of petroleum distillation.
They are composed of C and H in various proportions.
They are not pure compounds.
Figure 2.2: Boiling and freezing range vs Density of petroleum based liquid fuels chain compounds (like the family of methane, ethane, propane, etc.)
Figure 2.2 shows the boiling ranges and densities of these fuels.
One can see clearly that gasolines vaporise better than kerosenes, a fact which is easily known because, one can smell gasoline more than kerosene under ambient conditions.
One may wonder what smelling has to do with boiling point.
If something does not vaporise easily, its molecules are not found in the at- mosphere and cannot be smelt.
The fact that you cannot smell diesel as easily as gasoline implies that gasoline vaporises better than diesel.
Kerosenes come in a wide range.
They include those used at home as well as those meant for the gas turbines of aircraft, called aviation turbine fuel (ATF).
The ATF is a refined kerosene, obtained by particularly eliminating Sulphur so that the life of turbine blades (which experience the combusted hot gases of fuel — air mixture) is extended.
Gasoline is most extensively used in reciprocating spark ignition (SI) engines.
They vaporise easily and are mixed with air in right proportions before their entry into the combustion chamber.
Diesel fuels are used in compression ignition (CI) engines where no spark is needed to intitiate the combustion process.
These engines work at much higher compression ratio than gasoline engines.
The fuel is injected in the form of spray into hot compressed air.
The fuel ignites and combustion follows.
The liquids mentioned under special fuels and oxidizers in Table 2.1 are used in rocket engines.
Rocket engines are basically designed to work independently of the surrounding atmosphere so that they can go out of earth’s atmosphere and still function.
They are non-air breathing engines.
As such, one can look for several fuels and oxidizers.
Since one has to carry the oxidizer also, one does not carry air because 77% (by volume) of it is nitrogen which is inert and its density is too low (about a thousandth of that of a liquid).
One can, for instance, use liquified oxy- gen.
Alternately there are several liquids which have excess oxygen, like nitric acid (HNOs3), red fuming nitric acid (RFNA) that has about 12-14% dissolved nitrogen tetroxide in it), nitrogen tetroxide (N,O,), which is liquid at near ambient condi- tions (nitrogen tetroxide should be kept below 21°C for it to be a liquid).
Liquid oxygen (03) has a boiling point of —183°C' and is called a cryogenic oxidizer since its storage requires special design.
Very good low temperature insulation should be used that should itself be chilled before liquid oxygen is stored.
Several liquid fuels have been listed.
Hydrazine (VN, H2) is an interesting liquid— it can decompose by itself exothermally at higher temperatures and release heat.
If, for instance, an insulated tube is initially heated to 600°C and hydrazine is sprayed into it continuously, then hydrazine decomposes to ammonia, nitrogen and hydrogen and releases enough heat to maintain the temperature inside the tube for continuous decomposition.
But this is not the way hydrazine is actually used since what is required is that the liquid must decompose even at ambient temperatures.
For this purpose, exotic catalysts made of iridium and molybdenum in the form of small pellets packed into a cylindrical chamber are used.
Hydrazine is then sprayed on to the catalyst bed.
The catalysts decompose the liquid into gases almost instaneously.
Liquids which exhibit such a property are called monopropellants.
They are used in rockets attached to satellites for producing small force (or thrust as it is called) required for correction of attitude and position.
The next important feature of liquid fuels is what is known as hypergolic igni- tion.
To appreciate its meaning, two containers can be taken—one having a fuel like unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine, NoH>(C Hs); (not usually available in chem- istry laboratories, but in rocket laboratories) and the other, an oxidizer like red fuming nitric acid.
A pipette and a glass dish are the other accessories needed.
A small amount of fuel is first placed in the glass dish.
Then a small amount of fum- ing nitric acid is pipetted (not by sucking, but by just dipping the pipette into the liquid, closing the top of pippette and lifting off the pipette) and dropped into the fuel.
A bright flame erupts instantly.
Such reaction between liquids in the liquid phase, releasing gaseous components which are so exothermically reactive that the entire combustion process occurs in less than ten to fifteen milli seconds (0.01-0.015 s) is called hypergolic reaction.
Combinations of liquid fuel and oxidizer with this property are called hypergolic combinations.
Opening the valves in the fluid path in a rocket engine would automatically ensure ignition even in near vacuum
Figure 2.3: Composition of Biomass on an moisture-free, ash-free basis Coal is the largest and most widespread fossil fuel resource providing 70% of India’s energy and 23% of World’s energy.
It will remain as a fuel of relevance for a long time even though widespread concerns about ebvironmental emissions have begun to limit the growth of its use.
Coal is produced by natural processes over geological times when biomass was crushed under a load of overburden created by volcanoes and other natural disasters.
This process reduces the volatile content in biomass and what is left in coal is much lower as can be noted from Table 2.3.
Coal is classified by a term known as rank, which is a measure of the alteration the coal has undergone during its formation.
The consecutive stages in the evolution of the coal from biomass are: peat, lignite (brown coal), sub-bituminous coal, bituminous coal, and anthracite in the increasing order of the rank or the extent of carbonization.
Sub-bituminous coal, bituminous coal, and anthracite are together called black coal or hard coal.
Lignite (or brown coal) is relatively soft with a heating value of only about a quarter of that of black coal.
Coal is very dense as much as twice to thrice that of biomass because it is formed under highly stressed conditions.
Interlayered with other inorganic matter, coal beds form up to many meters in thickness and these are known as seams.
It is mined from open mines or from deep underground.
Coal varies widely in its composition.
It is composed chiefly of rings of six carbon atoms joined together in an extremely complex composition of layered arrangements that have not only hydrogen but significant amounts of oxygen and nitrogen.
The structure also includes varying amounts of sulfur which on combustion leads
Table 2.3: Composition of solid fuels — volatile fraction and fixed carbon in moisture free Item Moisture Ash Volatiles Fixed carbon fraction, % in mf fuel, % in mf fuel, % in mf fuel, % Bituminous coal ~ 10 <5 30 —40 45 — 45 Anthracite coal ~5 <15 15-20 60 — 65 Indian coal (E) ~5 ~ 25 30-35 35-40 Indian coal (F) ~5 ~ 35 30-35 25-30 Indian coal (G) ~5 ~ 45 30-35 15-20 to sulfur dioxide, and other inorganic matter that would end up as ash when coal is burnt.
The analysis of coal for moisture fraction, ash fraction, volatile matter and fixed carbon are set out in Table 2.3.
The content of sulfur and nitrogen (sulfur is about 0.3 to 0.8 % of the coal) is important for emissions of sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen (see Chapter 16 on emissions from combustion systems) when coal is burnt, generally in boilers.
The exhaust gases have to be treated to ensure compliance with emission norms of the state and the country.
Coals are burnt in furnaces fixed to boilers to generate high pressure steam that runs turbines which run electric generators.
Indian coals are characterized by a high ash content compared to rest of the coals in the world as can be seen from Table 2.3.
Their use poses problems of ash fusion and clinkering on grate whose resolution demands carefully thought-out solutions.
Sometimes the coal is finely powdered and the powdered coal (called pulverized coal) is burnt directly in furnaces.
There have been attempts to produce liquid fuels from coal by the distillation process.
Though there has been some success in this effort, the process is not widely accepted yet.
There are also methods by which the coal is gasified and the gases so obtained are cleaned and subjected to a process known as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to get a diesel like liquid fuel.
The special fuels and oxidizers are those used largely by the aerospace industry.
Many of the special fuels like polymers have been extensively used in other areas as well.
Polymers are essentially long-chain molecules of a basic chemical unit called monomer.
All plastic materials are polymers.
In fact many natural products are also polymers.
Typical molecular weights of polymers vary from 103 to 106.
At molecular weights of the order of 102, one has a very viscous liquid.
At 10°, one has a hard solid.
The monomers or liquid polymers called prepolymers.
Table 2.4: Molecular Composition of rocket fuels (HTPB = hydroxy terminated polybu- tadiesne, CTPB = carboxy terminated polybutadiene, AP = Ammonium perchlorate, HMX = cyclo tetramethylene tetranitramine, NC = Nitrocellulose, NG = Nitroglycerene) Species Fuel/Oxidiser Elemental Composition HTPB F OH — — — (C4Hg) — — — OH CTPB F COOH — — — (C4Hg) — — — COOH AP  Ox  NH4ClO4   HMX  F  (H2CNNO2)4   NC  F  C6H7O11N3(14 % N2)   NG  OX  C3H5O9N3 or molecular chain polymers on the addition of appropriate catalyst and/or suitable thermal curing.
Polymers were conceived for solid propellant use because, (a) one needs to mix a crystalline oxidizer like ammonium perchlorate powder at high solid loading like 75-87% (amount of solids in the mix) with a liquid binder, and (b) after curing it would lead to a solid with good mechanical integrity.
Since low temper- ature properties are required to be good, terminated polymers like CTPB, HTPB were developed and currently several such polymers with excellent properties have been obtained.
Most of these fuels are based on C and H, but O and N elements will be present to a certain extent.
The oxidizers are composed of C, H, N, O and CI elements.
Table 2.4 shows the molecular composition of some of the oxidizers and fuels used.
The propellants are of two categories: composite and double base.
Composite propellants are those in which there is only physical continuity but no molecular mixing between the ‘fuel’ and the ‘oxidizer’ in the propellant.
On the other hand, are those in which the oxidizer (NG) and the fuel (NC) cannot be distinguished once the propellant is made.
Composite propellants are more recent and can be tailor- made to meet more stringent performance specifications.
This material is then cured at elevated temperature (~ 150°C) to obtain a hard solid.
In the case of double base propellants, nitrocellulose (NC) in the form of fine strips or pieces is mixed with liquid nitroglycerine and other ingredients and the entire material is made into a dough which is then extruded.
Alternatively, nitrocellulose nodules (small spherical particles) are immersed in nitroglycerine liquid in a container, called a mould, and allowed to gel at temper- ature of 60°C or so.
The extruded propellants are mechanically stronger than the propellants made by the second process called casting procedure.
The propellants are cast in combustion chambers small to large.
The space shuttle engine booster uses several hundred tonnes of propellant.
Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) has 125 tonnes of composite propellant cast into its first stage alone.
Since solid propellants have their own oxidizer and fuel, they can be ignited by chance thereby posing a serious fire hazard.
As such, great care is taken in handling propellants for rocket applications.
More about the way propellants burn and the way to control them will be discussed later.
There are natural fuels and synthetic fuels and natural and synthetic oxidizers.
The most abundant fuels are biomass or biomass-related.
Synthetic fuels are used for special applications like rocket propulsion.
Most fuels are based on carbon, hydrogen, with some oxygen and nitrogen.
They are available in gaseous, liquid and solid forms.
The most natural oxidizer is oxygen present in air.
Examples of synthetic oxi- dizers are liquid oxygen, or specially prepared inorganic liquid or solid compounds.
There are many properties of the fuels/oxidizers which matter in their selection for a specific purpose.
The most important property is the energy content of the substance.
It decides how high the combustion temperature will be.
It is also important to know the quantity of oxidizer required to be mixed with a given amount of fuel in order to obtain peak combustion temperature.
This is called stoichiometry and is discussed next.
Stoichiometry implies the proportions of reacting elements in a chemical reaction.
Conventionally, it is used to refer to the ratio of oxidizer to fuel which just leads to complete products of combustion.
The important elements for consideration in a combustion reaction are C and H for fuel and O for oxidizer.
In the case of hydrocarbon combustion with air, if there is no excess of oxygen left with the products being COs, H,O and N, (inert), the proportion of air to fuel is termed Stoichiometry.
More air than this leads to lean mixtures, less air than this to rich mixtures.
The Stoichiometry reactions are represented H2 + (1/2)0s + [79/(21 x 2)Na] — Hy0 + [79/(21 x 2) No] (3.2) CHy + (3/2)02 — CO3 + HyO (3.3) CHy + (3/2)04 + (79/21) X (3/2) Ny — COq + HO + (79/21) X (3/2) Ny (3.4) In equation (3.1), one molecule of hydrogen reacts with half a molecule (!)
The half molecule does not mean much except for Stoichiometry purposes.
Since there are millions of molecules randomly moving around in any gas, the statement is taken to mean that every 2 molecules of H, react with one molecule of Oy and the product consists of 2 molecules of water.
One thing that must be understood is that the reaction never proceeds from reactants to products the way shown in equations (3.1) to (3.4), but by much more complex paths (see Chapter 5).
Another way of describing reaction (3.1) is that one mole of H, reacts with half a mole of O; to give one mole of H2O.
The word mole is taken to imply a molecular weight equivalent of mass.
That is, one mole of hydrogen implies approximately 2 grams of H2.
Similarly, half a mole of oxygen implies (1/2)x32 = 16 grams (g) of oxygen.
Thus one can state the reaction 3.1 as: 2 g of hydrogen reacts with 16 g of oxygen to give 18 g of water.
It is one of the underlying principles of chemical reactions that no mass is created or destroyed in a chemical reaction.
Only the form of the species changes.
It is also to be noticed that there is no mole conservation.
In fact, in reaction (3.1) the total number of moles has gone down from one and a half to unity.
Thus every gram of H, requires 8 grams of oxygen for complete combustion.
If more than 8 grams of oxygen is used, then one gets a fuel-lean system and if less than 8 grams of O, is used, one gets a fuel-rich system.
We now move on to reaction (3.2).
If one looks for stoichiometry with respect to air, then it will be [16+ (79/21) x2x28]/2 = 34.4.
In this reaction, nitrogen is treated as inert.
Nitrogen is a very stable molecule with a very high energy binding the nitrogen atoms.
If nitrogen were to enter into any reaction then this strong bond must be broken.
It requires very high temperatures ~ 2800 — 3000 K for a fair fraction of the molecules to be dissociated into element nitrogen (N2).
The temperature attained in reaction (3.2) would be of the order of 2300 K.
In reaction (3.4), the species considered is CH.
There is no specific species like CH; excepting as a radical which is an intermediate in reactions.
Rather it represents an extreme case of straight chain hydrocarbons described by CnH2n+2.
The value n = 1 gives CH4, methane, a gas at ambient conditions.
n = 4 gives C4H10 butane, a gas at ambient conditions.
It is the primary constituent of liquified petroleum gas (LPG).
C5H12 is pentane, a liquid.
The series goes on like this till at C12 H26 when one gets solids like waxes.
Thus all the straight-chain compounds can be described by CH2∣2/n.
CH2 is an approximate representative of the series.
The स्टोइकोमेट्रिक ratio in the case (3.3) is 3.4 and in the case (3.4) is 3.4/0.232=14.7.
The last number is very familiar.
For many hydrocarbons like kerosene, diesel, gasoline, the air-to- fuel ratio at stoichiometry is about 15.
It decreases slightly from methane (17.2) to about 15 for larger size fuel molecules like hexadecane (C16H34).
One should be careful about the use of stoichiometry in actual situations.
At flame temperatures of the order of 2300 K or so, dissociation of the molecules of CO2, and H2O occurs to a reasonable extent.
Consequently, one obtains some CO, OH, HO2 and others.
These are incomplete products of combustion.
One, therefore, needs additional oxygen to oxidise these.
This is one of the reasons why in many IC engines, 15-20% excess air is used (to make sure combustion is complete).
As far as stoichiometry is concerned, for hydrocarbons the products are CO2 and H20.
What will happen with other elements like Cl, Al etc?
Similarly, one can determine the stable product for other species as well.
One of the useful qualities related to stoichiometry is the equivalence ratio (e.r).
It is the ratio of fuel to oxidizer by weight in a given case to that at stoichiometry
stated in the form of an equation.
(fuel/air) stoichiometry, wt basis Thus, all stoichiometry mixtures have equivalence ratio of unity.
Till now, the discussion has been about fuels which have no oxidising element in them and vice versa.
In rocket propellants both fuels and oxidizers have both the elements and they need to be treated for fuel richness or otherwise.
For instance, one would ask about stoichiometry or equivalence ratio of ammo- nium perchlorate (AP), nitroglycerine (NG) or nitrocellulose (NC).
This amounts in weight basis to 40/117 = 34%.
Thus one describes Ammonium Perchlorate as oxidizer rich to the extent of 34% and it is called an oxidizer itself.
One can similarly show nitrocellulose as slightly fuel rich and nitroglycerine as slightly oxidizer rich.
If one wishes to stoichiometrically balance the combination to make a high performance propellant, one needs NG about 6 times as much as nitrocellulose.
This mixture gives a liquid like material and so one uses fuel rich mixtures close to 1:1 (NC : NG).
For all propellants based on HMX, the solid crystals of HMX are set into a fuel binder matrix.
HMX is slightly fuel rich.
Hence all solid propellants turn out to be fuel rich to varying extents.
In the case of liquid propellants, monopropellants like hydrogen peroxide (H202) or (N2H4) can be used in single propellant mode; there is no oxidizer in such cases.
H20s is oxidizer rich to the extent of (1/2)O, implying 47% oxidizer richness.
In the case of N2H4, exothermic decomposition takes place because of relatively unstable molecular configuration and not quite due to ‘oxidizer’ or ‘fuel’ molecules both being present.
In fact, at the temperatures considered (~1000-1400 K) Nitrogen is inert and hydrogen is of course a fuel.
In all cases where a single molecule has both fuel and oxidizer elements or elements in an unstable configuration, there is a way of defining fuel or oxidizer richness.
This is done by using the concept of defined as where e.r = (∑NiVi)f /(∑NiVi)ox is the number of atoms of elements, fuel or oxidizer and Vi, the valencies of the specific elements.
Table 3.1 contains a list of valencies of various elements
For H2O2 the formula gives e.r = (2x 1)/(2 x 2) = 0.5 from which one can see it is fuel lean.
Similarly (er)Ne =(6x44+7x1)/(11 x2) =1.41; (e.r)nyc = 0.94 (e.r) NH, ClO, = (4 X 1)/(1 x14+4x 2) =0.44 As can be noticed, the values of equivalence ratio confirm the expected feature re- garding fuel richness or otherwise.
Tables 3.2 and 3.3 give the stichometry ratio for a range of fuels with oxygen or with air as the oxidizer.
Those fuels which have oxygen as an element in their structure will need smaller amount (weight) of oxygen or air for combustion.
Those involving greater amount of hydrogen will need large amount (mass basis) of oxygen/air for combustion.
The stichometry ratios vary from about 2.5 to as much as 35.
The data with regard to solid fuels show that the composition of the fuels changes from wood to anthracite coal by successive carbonization.
The actual amount of oxygen and hydrogen stripped from the starting material depends on the process that occurs at high pressure and temperature inside earth.
The net result is that the oxygen-to-fuel ratio continues to rise from wood to coal as shown in Table 3.2.
The implications of stichometry ratio to combustion are very significant.
If one were to observe a flame from a burner which issues fuel gas into an otherwise undisturbed atmosphere, one would find that a hydrogen flame at the same mass flow rate is thirteen to fourteen times as long as that for carbon monoxide in the laminar range of flow rates.
(See Chapter 10 for further details).
If in a confined atmosphere, leakage takes place in the presence of a very hot spot, smaller amount of hydrogen will consume up all air available in comparison to hydrocarbons.
Till now we have been talking of fuels and oxidizers as though we know what they are.
Indeed how can we say what is oxidizer?
Is oxygen always an oxidizer?
Chemically an oxidizer is defined as one which acquires electrons and fuel as the one which can donate electrons.
The various elements are categorized in terms of ei- ther their richness in donating electrons or hunger in accepting electrons.
Such a table is called electronegativity table.
Table 3.4 shows the Pauling’s electronegativ- ity values in decreasing order.
In the fuel range, we have carbon, hydrogen, aluminum, magnesium, lithium, , , , , iodine, and potassium.
Thus in a compound like F2O3, fluorine has the oxidising capability and oxygen acts as a fuel.
Since fluorine is a very powerful oxidizer, it would react quickly and form stable products.
Nature therefore is bestowed with relatively small amounts of fluorine.
Oxygen, then remains the next most abundant and powerful oxidizer.
The power is reduced only by dilution with inert substance namely, nitrogen.
On the fuel side, the more reactive of the fuels are sodium and potassium.
Given a certain amount of oxygen, in an environment of mixture of fuel elements like C, H, Al, or Na, it is the metal elements which get oxidized largely, then hy- drogen and carbon elements.
The most common fuels are based on hydrocarbons.
But metals are used as well to meet the requirements in special cases like in rocket engines.
In this chapter we have seen some elementary, but important aspects of combustion namely stoichiometry.
We have also seen what fuels and oxidizers are and why they are so.
Fuels are donors of electrons and oxidizers are acceptors of electrons.
The most powerful oxidizer is fluorine; metals are very reactive fuels (though this quality alone does not make them most eminent all the time).
Stoichiometric ratio refers to the amount of oxidizer required to completely oxidize the fuel to stable products of combustion at ambient (or more correctly standard) conditions.
We shall now see what happens when reactions like the above take place.
You may have already concluded that heat is evolved during the reaction—how much heat and what happens to this heat?
Heat is intrinsically self-evident quantity which is experienced when a warm object is touched, or say, when a person lights a fire in an open field in a cold climate for warmth.
To develop from this qualitative understanding of heat a scheme by which quantities are measured, interrelated and predictions made requires the science of thermodynamics.
We need the major results of thermodynamics for finding the the temperature and the composition of combustion products when fuel and oxidizer burn.
This subject is called chemical thermodynamics to emphasize the presence of many species and their chemical interaction.
Thermodynamics deals with quantities of state at equilibrium — temperature, internal energy, enthalpy, entropy, availability and so on.
In the true sense of its description it is only thermostatics that attempts to answer certain questions concerning transformations, but not the rate.
The question of how fast heat is transferred from one point to another or how fast reaction takes place is outside the preview of classical equilibrium thermodynamics (as it is called).
One needs to study non-equilibrium thermodynamics for this purpose.
We shall presently review the elements of thermodynamics for understanding the way flame temperature or other equilibrium properties are calculated.
Firstly, what does the concept of equilibrium mean?
It simply means that characterizable properties do not change over space or time.
For this definition to be useful, the definition is modified to state that the properties do not change over ap- propriate scales of space and time.
To appreciate what this means, let us consider an example.
It is quite often stated that the temperature of the northern hemisphere is a few degrees more than that of the southern hemisphere, or that the peak temperature at Bangalore or any other city is 25°C.
Surely temperature over as large an area as say, Bangalore is never the same.
Even in a small area the temperature can vary by as much as several degrees.
So all that this statement implies is that in all regions, which are shaded from sun, the measured temperature is about the same as that measured at a meteorological station.
However, the temperature quoted at the airport for instance will be a few degrees different from that at the meteoro- logical station.
4 How Much Heat?
distances of possibly several kilometers around the meteorological station, but not over larger scales—for instance a distance as large as that to the airport—because temperature is not the same over this distance.
All that this implies is that equi- librium is said to occur over certain smaller scales in a system which by itself in totality, is at non-equilibrium.
Consider a candle flame.
The temperature measured through different parts of the flame is significantly different.
Yet we talk of temperature at a point.
This means that the total non-equilibrium system is split into a number of states which can be described by equilibrium properties—pressure, temperature etc.
Thermodynamics, as distinct from mechanics, introduces an additional quantity of state (equilibrium) needed for specifying a system—the temperature.
Zeroth law gives it a shape by indicating that several bodies in contact with each other are said to be in thermodynamic equilibrium provided they have the same temperature.
Stated differently, a quantity called temperature has to be the same if systems in physical contact are to be at equilibrium.
The first law summarizes the experience of life that energy can neither be cre- ated nor destroyed but only transformed; that one cannot continue to extract heat continuously without any other change in the system.
Conceiving that all descrip- tions require a system and surroundings and interactions between them, thermo- dynamics distinguishes between those in which there is no mass, momentum and heat transfer (called isolated systems) and those in which there is no mass transfer but momentum and heat transfer can occur (called closed systems) and those in which nothing is forbidden (called open system).
In the closed system one can conceive of a constant volume or constant pressure system to state the limits.
No work will be done in the case of a constant volume system.
Any heat transferred to this system (dg) will result in a raise in internal energy (de) of the system, which in perfect gas is cvdT.
(dq)v=constant = de = c, dT 4.1) where c¢, is called the constant volume specific heat = de/dT.
In the systems where pressure-volume work can be done—like a cylinder fitted with a piston at the top and on which one can set weights to change the pressure, the transfer of heat into the system causes a rise in internal energy along with the work required to move the piston.
(dq) p=constant = de + pdv (4.2) To treat such cases a quantity called एंथलपी (h) is defined as so that at constant pressure one gets h = e + pv = (dq) p=constant (4.4)
and thus the enthalpy change of the system represents the heat transfer to the system at constant pressure.
The difference between changes in enthalpy and internal energy represents work done by the system.
Like internal energy, enthalpy is also uniquely related to temperature in a perfect gas.
To see this, we need to make use of the equation of state, an equation relating pressure, density (or volume) and temperature resulting from Boyle’s and Charle’s Laws.
It is now the right time to discuss the properties of mixtures because we need to deal with situations of a number of species being together.
The fundamental principle that applies here is the one given by Dalton who stated that in a container having a mixture of gases the total pressure exerted by the mixture equals the sum of the pressures of the gases which can be taken to exert pressure as though each alone is present.
Equations (4.10) and (4.11) concerning Xi and Yi can be used to write Yi = mi /m = (ni Mi)/(nM) and we get
4 How Much Heat?
The above relations (4.16) are valid for specific heats, entropies and Gibbs free energies (to be treated later).
The enthalpy of any species is composed of two parts.
One of this is the sensible enthalpy.
hsi(T) = ∫ cpidT  (4.17) where L is the latent heat of vaporisation.
The second part of enthalpu due to the chemical and physical state of the substance, called the heat of formation, is due to differences in enthalpy between different species at the same temperature.
If there were no such differences one would not have exothermic reactions (and therefore, flames).
The heat of formation is essentially the heat of a reaction (which is a general form of the term heat of combustion) but, in a special reaction.
It is the heat of reaction in a reaction in which the species alone is the product and the component elements of the species are the only reactants at standard state (standard state is 298.16 K, 0.1 M Pa).
The heat of formation of the reactants at standard state is set to zero while compiling the tables of the complete data on heats of formation (denoted by hfi).
Since the heat of formation refers to a species, the first reaction (A) cannot qualify for consideration at all.
Hence (B) does not qualify either.
(C) and (D) reactions do qualify for consideration of heats of formation.
The heats of reaction here give the heat of formation of H2O and CO2.
For others, the table is formed from the measure- ments of heat of combustion/reaction in various reactions.
For example, Ho, O2, No, Fy, Clo, Bry, C(s), Mg, Al, B, are all taken to have zero heat of formation.
The heat of formation of H, O, OH, H2O, N, F2O3, HCl, HBr are all obtained from experimental data and by imposing conditions of self-consistency.
In a sense, the idea of heat of formation is no different from that of heat of combustion, which an engineer is most familiar with.
Heat of combustion refers to a reaction while heat of formation refers to a species.
The latter can be seen to be a great advantage since the same species can be involved in several kinds of reactions and one needs to keep track only of heat of formation of each of the species and not heats of reaction of several hundred combinations.
Table 4.1 shows the values of heats of formation (hfi) of some of the important species.
Table 4.1: Heats of formation (hfi, kJ/mole), I= liquid, s = solid
4 How Much Heat?
For this reaction we identify various coefficients as A1 = CH4, A2 = O2 A3 = CO2, A4 = H20 a1 = 1, a2 = 2, a3 = 0, a4 = 0, ả1 = 0, ả2 = 0, ả3 = 1, ả4 = 2 Hc = -74.5 + 394.0 + 2 x 242 = 803.5 kJ
4 How Much Heat?
The heat of combustion per kg of fuel will be (803.5/16)M J = 50.2 M J/kg.
at 298.16 K is 242 — 0 — 0 = 242 kJ and for H, it will be 242/2M J = 121 M J/kg.
If, in reaction (C) or any of the other reactions for that matter one adds an inert substance like nitrogen, the heat of combustion is not affected.
It is true that this heat is now absorbed by a mass augmented by inerts and hence one can expect the final temperature to be lower.
The heat released however, will remain the same.
Table 4.5 lists the heats of combustion for some reactions.
The second law states a principle indicating directions of processes.
For instance, heat flows from high temperature to low temperature.
The reverse does not happen unaided.
This part of the observation is not indicated in the first law.
The first law states that either of the processes can take place provided energy is conserved.
The second law is variously understood and discussed.
The useful view point here concerns the feature indicated above.
If ds < 0 in an isolated system, the system is not natural
If ds = 0, then the system is at equilibrium and no further change takes place.
Thus the second law introduces a quantity called entropy whose change will give a direction of process.
Second law does not define the absolute value of entropy.
It is defined by the third law which states that entropy of a crystalline substance is zero at absolute zero temperature.
Using the data on specific heats and enthalpies, entropy is calculated for various species and presented in Table 4.4 for the same species.
For closed systems operating at constant pressure and temperature, the quan- tity that indicates direction of processes is called Gibbs free energy.
It(g = h-Ts) is defined as dg = dh — Tds — sdT = dh — Tds (4.21) Since dT = 0 and dg < 0 for natural processes, is equal to dg=0 for equilibrium, greater than dg>0 for processes which do not take place by themselves.
It can be seen that when dh = 0, the principles noted above with respect to g are equivalent to those of entropy.
The fact that dg = 0 at equilibrium is used in the calculation of chemical composition at constant pressure and temperature.
Armed with the basic information we now have, we begin answering two questions: Will the reaction proceed along a direction indicated?
What is the composition for a given set of reactants at a given pressure and temperature?
Let us take an example.
Is N2O (g) ⥤ N2 (g) + (1/2) O2 (g)  at 300 K, 0.1M Pa a natural reaction?
To do this we compute grhs - glhs and see if it is positive, or negative.
Depending on this value we declare the reaction to be not natural, at equilibrium or natural.
hlhs = h + hs,N2N2OO (300) - hs,N2O (298.16) = 81.6 kJ   hrhs = hf,N2 + hs,N2O (300) - hs,N2O (298.16) = 81.6 kJ   ∆g  is negative and hence the reaction must be a natural one.
In making these calculations the data on heats of formation, sensible enthalpies and entropies have been used.
These are taken from Tables 4.1 to 4.3.
Let us take another example.
Consider H2O (I,0.1 M Pa) — H50 (g,0.1 M Pa).
4 How Much Heat?
Whether the reaction is natural or not depends on entropy changes as well as entropy changes.
Table 4.6 indicates the qualitative behaviour of reactions under various conditions.
All associa- tion reactions (H + OH ⥤ H2O, for example) are most probable at low temperatures but not so at high temperatures (Type 2).
Type 4 is opposite of Type 1.
We now proceed to answer the second question.
To do this we need a basic rela- tionship concerning the dependence of Gibbs free energy on pressure
We now consider reactions at equilibrium.
At equilibrium, the rates of forward reactions must equal those of reverse reactions so that there is no net production or destruction of any species.
During the transition from initial state to equilibrium the Gibbs free energy (at constant total pressure and temperature) will decrease
4.2 How Do We Compute the Composition?
Reactants: moles of various species; pressure p; temperature T (example H2, 1/2 O2, N2, etc.).
The process of reaction causes change of species without loss of elements.
For instance, while the final products may be HO, H2O, H2, H, O2, O, in different pro- portions, the total amount of H atoms has to be the same as initially introduced.
To calculate the composition, one must enunciate the possible products.
In the case of H2-O2-N2 reaction at high temperatures, one may have H2 H, O, HO, H2O, N2, N, NO, N2O, HNO (11 species) as possible products.
The number of elements is three.
8 is the number of equilibrium relations needed to complete the set of equations.
4 How Much Heat?
Figure 4.1: Isolated cylinder with piston small concentration at certain temperatures.
This reduces the number of equations to be solved.
The equilibrium relations and element conservation equations are solved together to obtain the composition.
These equations constitute a set of nonlinear algebraic equations whose size is large even for 2 or 3 elements.
From the early sixties to the seventies, several attempts were made to solve such equations by various means and a very powerful computer technique was developed at NASA in the early seventies.
This is a workhorse programme used all over the world in obtaining the equilibrium composition (and adiabatic flame temperature as well).
This programme minimizes the Gibbs free energy (at p = constant, T' = constant) to obtain the equilibrium composition.
4.3 How Do We Obtain Flame Temperature We have laid the foundations for calculating the flame temperature.
We make an important and reasonably good approximation: the flame temperature is attained as in an adiabatic situation.
This implies that no heat is lost to the surroundings from the system.
This situation is typified in Fig. 4.1
The reactants are kept in an isolated cylinder with a piston to simulate the pressure.
Then they are sparked to initiate ignition.
After this the reactions proceed to completion.
The temperature rises to adiabatic flame temperature.
The calculations are made using of the idea described in Fig.4.2
A first estimate of adiabatic flame temperature is made.
4.3 How Do We Obtain Flame Temperature Figure 4.2: Adiabatic flame temperature determination calculated using the scheme enunciated earlier.
This composition is set in box (B).
The change in chemical enthalpy between (A) and (B) is obtained in the manner in which the heat of combustion is calculated.
This part of rise in temperature is in the form of sensible enthalpy rise.
If all the heat of combustion is used up to raise the temperature to Tf, then one has obtained the adiabatic flame temperature.
If some heat is left in balance or the heat absorbed is larger than what is available for an assumed temperature Tf, keep computing the composition and checking the bal- ance till heat balance is satisfied to the required degree of accuracy.
If the reaction then ∑(a'i - ai)[hf,i + hs,i (T0) - hs,i (298.16)] is the heat of combustion and ∑a'i ai (hs,i(Tf) - hs,i (T0)) is the sensible enthalpy absorbed.
We shall take a few examples to clarify the procedure.
Reactants: H2, O2, (79/21) N2: initial temperature: 298.16 K; and pressure: 0.1 M Pa.
It means that H2 + O2 + 3.76 N2 ⥤ H2O + (1/2) O2 + 3.76 N2 and therefore,  a1 = 1, a2 = 1, a3 = 3.76, a'1= 0, a'2 = 1/2, a'3 = 3.76, a'4 = 1
4 How Much Heat?
Heat of combustion = 242 kJ.
If there were no nitrogen in the initial mixture, one would (40 + 1/2 x 40)(Tf — 298.16) = 242.0 k.J Ty — 298.16 = 242000/60 = 4330 K, Ty ~ 4630 K. At this temperature, the product H2O will not remain undissociated.
Therefore a fair amount of enthalpy will be absorbed in dissociation.
The products contain H2O, O2, OH, O, H etc.
the process of creating the elements and radicals makes lesser amount of enthalpy available for raising the temperature.
This makes the temperature to be about 2600 K or so.
One can make detailed calculations (given the initial data) using the NASA programme referred to earlier.
This programme is so powerful that in most cases one can obtain a result in less than a few seconds of computational time on any modern personal computer.
Till now, discussions were concentrated on reactions at constant pressure because in several practical situations like in rocket engines or diesel combustion, combustion occurs at constant pressure.
There may be situations where combustion occurs at constant volume.
In such cases the quantity to be used for minimization is Helmholtz free energy function = e - Ts.
Generally, these values will be larger than those corresponding to constant pressure by 100-200 K because there is no work output in a constant volume reaction.
We shall take a look at some results.
Table 4.7 shows the results of flame temperature and product composition for kerosene—air system for various air-to-fuel ratios.
The stichometry ratio is about 15.
The flame temperature peaks around this value and drops on either side.
The products at this condition contain about 1.2% (vol) of carbon monoxide.
If we use
4.3 How Do We Obtain Flame Temperature Table 4.7: Flame temperature, equlibrium composition and other properties of kerosene—air Kerosene, about 30% excess air, then carbon monoxide becomes negligible.
At A/F of 30 or beyond, the only products are H2O, CO2, N2 and excess O2.
It is under these conditions that the approximations made earlier for the calculation of flame temperature in the example are valid.
One can notice that the molecular weight of gases is lower for fuel-rich conditions and achieves the value of air at oxidizer-rich conditions.
The typical values of temperature for several common fuel and oxidizer combinations are shown in Table 4.8.
The flame temperature does not depend significantly on the nature of hydrocarbon fuel as long as the oxidizer is air.
It is particularly true for flame temperatures beyond 3000 K, because most of the energy goes into dissociating the stable molecules so that the temperature does not change much.
Increase in pressure is helpful in reducing dissociation, thereby causing a rise in flame temperature.
The change in flame temperature, again, beyond some pressure is very limited because the change in composition beyond pressures of 5.0-8.0 M Pa is not much.
Acetylene with its high heat of formation has a flame temperature with air distinctly higher than other straight chain hydrocarbons.
4 How Much Heat?
Table 4.8: Flame temperature of some typical fuels Fuel Oxidizer Pressure Initial Peak Producer gas and wood are low-energy fuels compared to hydrocarbons.
Producer gas has about one-tenth the heat of combustion of kerosene on weight basis.
Since it needs little air to burn stoichiometrically, it still can raise the temperature to a significant value (~ 1500 K).
Wood (dry) has a calorific value of about 16-20 M J/kg, being a little more than one-third that of kerosene; it also has oxygen in it.
It needs about six and a half times its weight of air to combust stoichiometrically and ideally attains a temperature of1900 K.
c* is called the characteristic velocity.
It is given by where the ratio of specific heats (~1.2) and is about 0.62.
Higher c* means better performance of a rocket propellant combination.
Whereas in the case of solid propellant (not shown here) as well as UDMH-N,0, liquid propellant, the peak in T; corresponds roughly to peak in c* implying that molecular weight variation does not play a major role, in the case of liquid hydrogen-liquid oxygen (LH,— LOX) system, variation in plays a significant role.
As can be noticed, M(H2) = 2 and M(H2O) = 18, the average molecular weight varies between 8 and 18 in the figure.
4.3 How Do We Obtain Flame Temperature Figure 4.3: Equilibrium combustion properties

mixture H2-LOX fuel rich causes an increase in Tf/M even though Tf decreases
This fact is made use of in  LOX-LH2 engine where the operating oxidizer to fuel ratio is only 4.5 to 5 even though the stiochometry ratio is 8.
The flame temperature is reduced, which reduces the thermal problem on the engine.
measured flame temperature It is useful to examine as to what extent does theory replicate reality, for it is often thought that theory is always very distant from reality.
The word “theoretical” itself has several levels.
The first is the adiabatic flame temperature.
This does not involve flow aspects.
The next aspect includes fluid flow effects that influence the flame temperature through stretch (or straining of flame surfaces).
Thirdly, there are heat losses by the system with flame to the surroundings.
Inference from flame temperature measurements should accpont fof these aspects.
When it is asked whether the adiabatic flame temperature computed by the procedure outlined earlier is realized in actual practice, it is to be understood that stretch effects are excluded.
One can expect that in a complex flow field, the fluid elements will move in various directions.
A flame is expected to be stretched if there is change in fluid velocity in a direction parallel to the flame surface.
This stretch can be positive or negative.
Positive stretch makes the flame thinner.
Negative stretch makes the flame thicker.
When a flame is flat and the premixed fluid flows through the flame in a direction normal to it, one would have an unstrained flame.
This is an ideal flame discussed in chapter 6.
In a classical Bunsen flame, the region near the top where the flame is curved, one experiences negative stretch (also called compressive strain rate) and the conical region below this segment experiences positive stretch.
In a complex flow field, the flame surface could move unsteadily and curve up in various directions, leading to various strains being imposed on the flame.
If one measures the temperature in the burnt zone just after a flat flame, one would really measure the adiabatic flame temperature corresponding to the mixture ratio of premixed mixture.
If one measures the temperatures in a conical (Bunsen) flame one will find stretch is to reduce the flame speed’ or the local consumption rate and at extreme stretch, there could be flame extinction as well.
If the flame is turbulent, one could have flame extinguishment at several locations at different instants leading to temperature fluctuations from the ambient value to high temperature largely because of these effects.
The effect of heat losses will be severe in small systems and lesser in larger systems - the governing factor would be a geometry which minimizes the surface area that contributes to heat loss but has necessary volume to release the heat.
4.5 Can we raise the peak temperature from a given reactant set?
4.5 Can we raise the peak temperature from a given This question becomes relevant in industries that use low quality fuels but intend to perform thermal operation requiring high temperature like the glazing opera- tion on ceramic material or melting of iron.
In the former case at least 1350 K is required and in the latter at least 1600 K is required.
If we are using a fuel— oxidant mixture that generates 1100 K, how can we achieve the objectives noted above?
Figure 4.4 shows the schematic of how this can be achieved.
The fuel- oxidant mixture is burnt in two locations, with the hot gas from the first location being used in a heat exchanger to preheat the oxidant alone or the fuel as well before being used in the second combustion system.
Since the entry conditions for the second combustion system have reactants at sufficiently high temperature (even up to 800 K depending on the quality of the heat exchanger), it is possible to raise the temperature even up to 1700 K. In many practical situations, the waste heat from the process itself can be used for preheating the reactants, either in part or com- pletely.
4 How Much Heat?
By putting up a heat exchanger to heat the air for combustion, such industries would have derived enormous financial benefit and would have saved the planet considerable fuel!
We have discussed in this chapter the essential elements of chemical thermodynamics.
The science of this area is well developed and understood.
Powerful computer programmes for the calculation of adiabatic flame properties are available.
The measured temperatures of flames in actual situations is lower due to stretch effects as well as heat loss.
Increasing the peak combustion temperatures can be achieved by using a separate combustor to preheat the reactants if the process concerned does not have an exhaust (waste) stream at high temperature.
Equilibrium adiabatic flame temperature sets the upper limit of observed flame temperature for most systems—gaseous oxidizer, fuel; solid propellant, liquid bipropellants.
There is one important exception in some liquid monopropellants - hydrazine.
In this case, the measured decomposition temperature ex- ceeds the adiabatic flame temperature.
The reason lies in the fact that ammonia, one of the products decomposes endothermically very slowly to N2 and H2.
Thus in an actual system decomposition is partial and not complete.
This leads to a slightly better performance in terms of Tf and c* in the actual system compared to equilibrium conditions.
5 How Does a Reaction Proceed?
At What We saw till now what reaction products are and how to compute their mass or mole fractions in the mixture.
The question we ask now is how fast is an equilibrium state attained from a given initial state.
In order to compute this we should describe the rate of generation or destruction of a given species in a reaction system.
It may be recalled that a hydrogen—oxygen reaction was set out as  H2 + (1/2)O2 + pN2 ⥤  H2O + pN2  Does the reaction proceed this way?
If the products contain many species like we found in equilibrium products, will the reaction proceed differently?
The reaction does not proceed in the way indicated by simple stoichiometry.
This is not due to the fact that equilibrium products contain many other species, for one can consider cases of low flame temperature with a larger inert fraction and make sure that no species other than the only stable product are present in any significant measure.
Yet the reaction does not proceed along the path shown.
Why is this so?
To answer this we must understand as to how a reaction takes place.
In a gaseous medium it is known that molecules are moving randomly with a range of velocities with a mean related to the temperature of the gas.
Collisions occur during the random movements of molecules.
These collisions are usually unproductive, i.e.
the molecules after collision move away in different directions without any change in the molecular structure.
Amongst these collisions, some occur at higher velocities.
At these velocities the molecules act like bullets and when they collide, they end up breaking up molecules or forming bonds with other molecules.
For instance, consider the following reactions: In the first reaction, H2 collides with another H2, and breaks up to form Hydrogen atoms.
Here only one bond is broken.
In reaction (2), the collision of H2 occurs
5.1 How Fast Does a Reaction Take Place?
The reaction rate is now understood to be due to collisions largely between two molecules (called bimolecular).
This means the rate of reaction is proportional to concentration of molecules of each of the participants-higher pressure implying higher concentrations, linearly.
Thus Reaction rate (RR) = AXiX2p2
Next we examine the dependence of the reaction rate on temperature.
It is to be recalled that energetic collisions are responsible for a reaction.
It is not the molecules with mean energy that matter, but those with much larger energy levels.
It implies that one can set a threshold value of energy E which must be exceeded for
The Boltzmann energy distribution law states that the probability of a molecule possessing energy FE is proportional to exp(—E/RT).
More elaborate study obtains expression for probability of molecules possessing energy equal to and larger than E to be approximately exp(—E/RT).
Thus, the reactants (in a true situation, the single step molecular event in a large number of s) have to have energy larger than E for reaction to be successful and the fraction of such molecules is exp(- E /RT).
This dependence is also termed Arrhenius law.
Thus, the reaction rate can be taken to be The quantity Af, is called frequency factor and is a constant.
It is proportional to collision frequency, the number of collisions per unit time.
The study of chemical reactions this way is not special to combustion alone.
Chemical engineers do deal with reaction rates but mostly isothermal.
Biochemical reactions take place at temperatures near ambient temperature.
In fact, most microorganisms die beyond 80-90°C.
It is only in combustion that temperature range of 300-3600 K is experienced in a single system like a flame.
Consider the example of an H atom colliding with a propane molecule.
One can notice in Fig 5.1 that there are several paths of approach that the H atom can take when it attacks a large molecule like propane.
Since the bond strength between various atoms is different, the ability of H atom to break up the propane molecule is different along the different orientations shown.
Hence the reaction rate will get affected by the orientation of the molecule in the reaction.
For a general reaction,
5.1 How Fast Does a Reaction Take Place?
Ci = species concentration (moles/volume).
This relationship is called the law of mass action.
It describes the rate of reaction as a function of species concentrations, and a constant dependent on temperature.
If the reverse reaction ∑aiAi ⥨∑àiAi is involved and if one uses equation of state and relationships between molar and mass fractions, one gets Where the first and second terms within the parenthesis sign are the rates of forward and backward reactions.
Now if steady state or equilibrium is attained, one gets dYi/dt = 0 and so Thus one can note that equilibrium constant is obtained in the limit of reaction rates in a reversible reaction going to zero.
These are usually determined from specially performed experiments.
Since the reaction rates are very large and the reaction times are very small (a few micro seconds to a tenth of a millisecond or so), transient instrumentation techniques are used to obtain the data.
Once kf, is known, the backward rate kbi is obtained from equilibrium constant which is known from thermodynamics, the data being specific heats and entropies.
Some features of the reaction rate expression are interesting.
Typical values of the activation energy E are of the order of 100-150 kJ/mol for most hydrocarbon- oxygen reactions.
If we examine the dependence of reaction rate on temperature, RRr, /RRy, = e B/BT1 j= E/T (5.6) For E/R = 5000 K (note R = 8.346 J/mol K)
Thus, a 10% change in temperature more than doubles the reaction rate.
This steep dependence of reaction rate on temperature causes the study of combustion very intriguing and interesting.
The reaction rate increases at a fast rate with temperature.
But in a premixed gas, as the temperature increases, the reactants are consumed and the rate has to decrease beyond some temperature and go to zero eventually when the reactants are totally consumed.
The temperature at which peak occurs being related to activation energy (overall).
Till now we have discussed the essentials of reaction paths and reaction rates of elementary s or molecular events.
It has been brought out that single overall s written down are good enough for stiochometry calculations although they do not indeed take place that way.
This implies that one cannot write down strictly an overall expression for the reaction rate.
While this is indeed valid, engineering science does not get limited by such ‘pure’ thoughts.
An engineering mathematician models reactions by a single step, assigns a rate equation with some parameters and conducts analysis and obtains general results.
He does this because the treatment of complex kinetics is indeed very formidable.
Typically n is 1.8 to 2.2 in most cases.
Till the seventies, ninety per cent of the flame problems were treated based on single-step reaction assumption.
It is only in the last two decades that complex kinetics has been treated using better numerical techniques and faster computers.
A further factor is related to values of activation energy and pre-exponential factor (like Af in the Eqn).
numbers are at best known to an accuracy of a factor of 10 and the activation energy to an accuracy of 20-30%.
(See Table 5.1 for data on several reactions and their rate data.)
So, it was argued, there was not much point in making accurate calculations because the data were so uncertain.
In the last Fifteen years, chemical kineti- cists have improved the accuracy of data of many elementary s and it has become worthwhile making detailed calculations.
Some of the spectacular advances will be discussed in later chapters (see for instance, premixed flames, Chapter 6).
Even so, efforts to obtain an equivalent single-step reaction rate expression based on initial reactant concentrations continue.
Whereever a single-step reaction is inadequate, successively increasing number of s are used to describe the chemical system so that some overall predictions on ignition, flame propagation, etc.
can be accurately obtained.
A great advantage now, in comparison to earlier times, is that a lot more experimental data of a discriminatory nature are available.
Further, comparisons of simplified models can be made with the results of complex chemistry and the limitations of simplified model obtained.
Much of these are in the frontier area of research.
Chemical reactions of importance to combustion are characterized by a strong dependence on temperature.
Active radicals are a central part of the description of flames.
These are generated by molecular events involving energetic collisions.
Phenomena dependent on or affected by reaction dominance like premixed gas ignition and/or steady propagation call for a more detailed description of reactions to be taken into account.
For obtaining qualitative dependencies even in such cases, the idea of a single-step overall reaction is very useful.
In overall reactions, a single- step equivalent reaction rate can be written as ,where the exponents n1,n2 and n can all be different (generally n1 = n2 = 1, n = 2).
5 How Does a Reaction Proceed?
At What Rate?
Premixed flames are those generated when the fuel and the oxidizer are mixed be- fore letting them into the combustion zone.
They are not common in nature because if they were, there would have been serious fire hazards.
a glass tube is initially filled with premixed gaseous mixture of fuel and oxidizer, say air, and sparked by using a high voltage source.
After the mixture is sparked, a flame will propagate through the mixture.
The flame will be plane in the early stages and becomes curved as it passes further.
The flame becomes curved because of the viscous effect of the glass tube.
the apparatus contains rotameters to measure the flow rate, and a mixer to mix the fuel and air and pass the mixture so that it attains uniform velocity at the exit.
If the mixture is sparked, a flame which is plane and thin would remain nearly stationary.
The velocity of the unburned fuel-air mixture entering the flame when it is stationary is the flame speed denoted normally by Su, the subscript u referring to the unburnt condition.
This situation is similar to the one described earlier excepting that in (a) the gases are quiescent and flame propagates and in (b) flame is stationary and gases are moving in.
In apparatus (b), the fuel and air flow rates can be varied so that the air-to-fuel ratio can be varied and the flame speed can be measured
At mixture ratios far from stoichiometry, the flame speed reduces to very small values and eventually at very lean and very rich mixtures, the flame does not propagate at all.
These lean and rich mixture ratios are called flammability limits.
Figure 6.1 (c) represents flame over a Bunsen Burner.
As the flow rate increases, the flame becomes a deeper conical one.
The velocity of incoming gases along a direction normal to the flame is the flame speed.
If the flow rate is increased, the flame adjusts itself such that the speed of incoming gases normal to the flame will still be the flame speed.
Typical flame speeds are about 0.30-0.5 m/s for hydrocarbon-air fuels
6.2 Why are we interested so much in Flame Speeds?
Before we answer this question, we shall examine the dependence of the flame speed on various parameters through a simple analysis.
If ẅf''' is the reaction rate (kg/m3s) of the fuel and H the heat of combustion, then H w''df represents the heat flux (W/m2)
(if it is multiplied by unit cross section, then one gets the heat generated in kW).
The flame thickness is inversely proportional to flame speed.
Experimental results confirm this as already indicated.
The flame speed varies as the square root of reaction rate.
The reaction rate in the above expression should be treated as an average value, The expression indicates that flame speed is representative of the reaction rate of premixed mixture.
If we now recall the results of flame speed indicated earlier, we conclude that H2-O2, stiochiometry mixture is lot more reactive compared to H2-air which itself is more reactive compared to LPG-air system.
If most reactions are taken as bimolecular, n ~ 2, then Su ~ p0, i.e., Su is independent of pressure.
Thus the pressure index of S, varies from 0.1 to 0.2 for this range of overall orders of reaction (1.8 to 2.4) which is usual for most systems.
This result is in complete conformity with experimental observations.
The dependence on initial temperature is caused through the change in flame temperature.
6.2 Why are we interested so much in Flame Speeds?
Let us consider the question of importance of flame speeds in combustion processes.
Several phenomena like ignition, quenching, lifting and blow-off of diffusion flames, blow-off of high-speed premixed mixtures are all related to chemical reactivity of a gaseous mixture.
These can therefore be directly related to the burning velocity of a mixture.
In situations where chemical reactivity is to be treated, one can use the flame speed as the representative quantity.
If a solid propellant is burning in one-dimensional geometry, then the configuration is similar to the flame in gaseous media excepting that a solid interface is accepting the heat transfer from flame and burning.
If a porous bed of pieces of solid fuel (like bio-fuel or coal) is burning with the flow of air through the bed, the flame front propagates through the bed against the air flow.
This process is similar to the propagation behavior in gaseous fuel-oxidizer mixtures.
While the simple analysis described above is adequate to understand the over- all features, much effort is needed to elucidate the dependence of flame speed on pressure.
This is because what is being done is to relate the pressure index of the flame speed to reaction rate pressure index, something which is unknown because the reaction proceeds in several tepss and it is not clear a-priori which of the steps is/are important.
In order to take complex kinetics into account, one needs to solve conservation equations, involving mass, momentum and energy, in general.
In respect of deflagaration (subsonic flame propagation) it is adequate to solve species (mass) and energy conservation equations.
The conservation equations of many species being formed or destroyed via various s are solved on a computer which results in flame speed, temperature and mass fraction profiles.
Computation performed for several pressures will reveal the pressure index.
The resulting profile can also be used to obtain the overall heat release rates as a function of local temperature.
One can then determine the reactivity of the gaseous mixture.
Figure 6.4 shows the plots for H2-O2 and hydrocarbon-air systems.
It can be seen that peak heat release rates are as high as 106-107 MW/m3
Referring back to Fig 6.1, wherein various geometries of premixed flame are shown, it is possible that the flames could be pro- duced with large ducts and at reasonably high velocities as well.
In such cases the flames no longer remain laminar.
High speed pictures will show combustion zones randomly moving around; the flame will be noisy as well.
Such flames are said to be affected by turbulence.
Turbulence begins to play a significant role in ducts for Reynolds numbers larger than 2300 or so.
At any level of intensity, if the scale of turbulence is large, it is taken that the flame is simply contorted (or more generally called wrinkled) and this increases the consumption rate by increasing the surface area for combustion.
Thus, at high Reynolds number (~ 104), the turbulent flame can be ten times as thick and propagate ten times as fast as a laminar flame.
While these overall results are quite in agreement with experimental observations, the foundations are by no means sound.
For instance, it is not clear why the reaction rates in turbulent range should be the same as for laminar range.
This is an area of current research where theoretical description is refined to predict details of flame structure in ad- dition to overall results.
Laminar flames are often understood to be only of theoretical importance and that turbulent flames that are of practical relevance.
This is not true.
Laminar flames are also of practical importance.
Solid propellant combustion processes occur at length scales of a ten to hundred microns with gas efflux velocities of a few m/s.
With viscosity being high due to high temperatures (of 1000 to 2000 K), the effective Reynolds number of the flow is 10 to 100.
The flows coming out of the propellant surface would be unsteady, but laminar.
Flame quenching (see the next chapter) is a process that occurs at dimensions and velocities that are in the laminar flow regime.
A new subject called micro-combustion process being evolved now occurs in the laminar flow regime.
Flames propagating at constant speed can be treated as stationary by reversing the inflow at the speed required to maintain the steady behavior.
The speed at which the unburnt mixture approaches the steady flame is termed the burning velocity and it characterises the chemical reactivity of the mixture.
The propagation speeds are weakly dependent on the pressure, but strongly on the initial temperature of the mixture.
Reducing the dilution increases the propagation speed.
Premixed combustion process behavior dominates the combustion of double-base propellants at all pressures and composite propellants at low pressure.
The specific qualification in terms of pressure arises from the consideration that the propellant ingredients are in a molecularly mixed state in double base propellants and the length scales of combustion at low pressure are large compared to the particle sizes in a composite propellant.
Turbulent flames burning in some regimes can be treated as wrinkled laminar flames.
In fine scale highly-turbulent combustion, turbulence interacts deeply with reaction process.
Suppose you had to light an LPG gas stove manually.
You would possibly use a mechanical spark igniter.
You would open the valve on the front and cause the spark a few seconds later.
Unless you time the spark properly, the gas would not ignite.
You do it a few times at various locations around the gas exit region.
At one moment you may find that the entire gas mixture ignites.
Also, if you open the valve and start the sparking operation too late near the gas exit region, you would not achieve any success.
What is it that is happening?
The gas will ignite and flame will stabilize provided the mixture is neither too rich nor too lean in the spark region.
If you sparked too early (after you complete the operation of opening the valve) the gas would not have arrived at the spark region after mixing with air and so the mixture will possibly be too lean to ignite.
If you sparked too late, the mixture of fuel and air issuing out of the gas outlet would possibly be too fuel-rich and so it would not ignite at all.
To give another example, if the valve of a gas stove or gas cylinder is inadvertently left open (or leaks), gas accumulation takes place in a confined area.
A short while after leakage is noticed, and before any corrective action can be taken, the whole gas is up in flames.
In this situation the leaked gas would be mixing with air and the mixture which would be moving around possibly due to ambient wind encounters an excelent ignition source and the gas (in the appropriate mixture ratio range) ignites.
In both these cases, the essential feature is that the gas mixture is inflammable only over a limited range of mixture ratios.
Inflammability limits are the range of fuel-oxidant mixture ratios within which a flame can propagate and beyond which flame cannot propagate.
It is experimentally measured by a rather simple apparatus.
A long tube (10-12 times the diameter in length) typically of 40-60 mm diameter (diameter cannot be too small) is filled with a mixture of chosen mixture ratio.
It is sparked at the top, middle, or bottom.
If the flame propagates, then the mixture ratio is moved further to lean or rich side.
That mixture ratio at which flame hes- itates to propagate (or does not just propagate) is the inflammability limit.
There are slight differences between results of upward and downward flame propagation.
But we will not consider these.
For instance, consider the results of methane-air mixture as shown in Fig 6.2.
If you notice the left hand side region, the curve is approaching very small flame speed at fuel fraction of 5% (by volume).
This is typically about 0.02 m/s.
Similarly, on the rich side, the curve drops down to very small values at fuel fraction of 15%.
The flammability limits may therefore be taken to lie between 5-15% for methane- air at ambient temperature.
An important question concerning these values has been raised in literature.
If we have treat an adiabatic flame propagation, would there be limits or would the propagation occur at any mixture strength?
It is indeed true to say that adiabatic flame should be capable of propagation at any mixture ratio.
This fact has been proved by systematic calculation of the propagational behavior.
In reality however, there are heat losses-the irreducible heat loss due to radiation from the flame.
If one calculates the propagation speed as a function of mixture strength, one finds that the difference between the speeds without and with heat loss is very small at stoichiometry (about 2 %) and increases towards the lean and rich conditions.
At the low propagational speeds, the energy present in the flame is so small that relatively small heat loss is enough to quench the flame.
One can impose natural heat loss behavior and calculate the limits.
These match with the observed limits.
Some typical values of flammability limits are given in Table 7.1.
It may be noticed from Table 7.1 that: the limits get enlarged because of oxygen essentially due to greater reactivity; that in the case of acetylene the upper limit is 100% because acetylene is exothermically decomposable by itself; hydrogen has very wide limits compared to hydrocarbons due to its higher reactivity; the upper limit (rich) is about 2—4 times the stoichiometry; the lower limit (lean limit) is about 30-60% of the stoichiometry.
The limits get enlarged at higher initial temperatures.
The lean limit remains unaltered because of increase of pressure.
The upper limit is enhanced substantially at higher pressures.
The data on Table 7.1 and the discussion in then earlier paragraph imply that the behaviour is different for lean and rich operating conditions.
These are due to chemical kinetic effects which should be taken into account along with heat losses if the predictions are to be realistic.
While simple theories explain many observed features qualitatively, computational studies with realistic chemistry and multi-dimensional geometry have captured many observed features.
Suppose one k conducting the experiment on flammability limits with cylindrical tubes of successively lower diameter.
The flammability limits remain about the same till a certain value, typically about 20 mm or so.
This diameter at which flame will not propagate at all
The answer lies in the fact that the heat production or release rate of the flame is not adequate enough to overcome the heat losses and propagate.
Another way of stating this result is that the flame speed k decreasing from adiabatic value to lower values depending on the extent of heat loss and it becomes zero when heat loss rate is a significant fraction of the heat generation rate.
The heat generation rate is calculated by multiplying the volumetric reaction rate by the heat of combustion and volume of combustion zone given by the cross sectional area of the duct and flame thickness.
For propagation through tubes, which is being considered at present, it is the loss by conduction to the walls that matters.
This heat loss is estimated by stating If heat generation rate is comparable to heat loss rate, then quenching may be considered to occur (d - dq, is the quench diameter).
We note that H = cp (Tf - T0) and obtain
The proportionality constant, C, varies between 10 and 30.
The dependence of quench distance on pressure and initial temperature is essentially through the laminar flame thickness of flame speed.
Typically, n ~ 2 and so d; ~ 1/p.
The dependence on initial temperature is felt through its effect on the flame temperature.
Typical values of quench distance for some gases are shown in Table 7.2.
One can notice from Table 7.2 that the lowest quench distance is as low as 0.2 mm.
Thus it is difficult to prevent H2O2, flame from moving across any barrier in ducts.
The information on inflammability limits is useful for causing ignition as well as preventing fires.
If a fuel-oxidant mixture needs to be ignited, it must lie within the limits of flammability.
Thus, one simple check to determine if a mixture is ignitable is to examine the limits of flammability.
There are occasions where one does not want a mixture to ignite.
One practical instance is as follows.
Most submarines have a device to surface fast from depths in case of an emergency.
produces gases at high pressure.
These gases act on the surface of water in the chamber and so the water is ejected.
The products of decomposition of hydrazine are ammonia, hydrogen and nitrogen.
This mixture at a temperature of about 400- 500°C, mixes with air in the ballast tanks.
Pressures are anywhere between 2.5-3.0 M Pa (25-30 times the ambient pressure).
It is not immediately clear if the mixture will ignite in the environment.
If it ignites, the results would be disastrous.
Examination of data in the light of knowledge of flammability limits indicates that the possibility of ignition cannot be ruled out.
Experimental evidence indicates a high incidence of ignition (and explosion) in several tests made at various conditions.
Similarly, quenching has several useful practical aspects.
Several chemical industries deal with hydrogen and hydrogen-air or other mixtures.
In industries, these gases are handled at fairly high flow rates.
If there happens to be ignition anywhere, the flame will propagate (at as much as 1.5-2.5 m/s for hydrogen Air system) throughout the system and may enter a large hold of gas and cause explosion.
In all such cases, it is important to isolate various systems so that the possibility of flame in any one region does not affect the other units/systems.
For designing flame isolators, one needs to use the information on quench distances.
Two systems, if connected through a large number of parallel tubes each of diam- eter less than quench distance (the large number is to provide for adequate total cross sectional area) and preferably made of high conductivity material, would be- come decoupled because flame cannot cross from one to the other.
A somewhat similar design has been used to design a flare to burn combustible gases from a biomass gasification system.
This system needs to be used certainly at the first start-up, and in emergency shutdowns and also at other times required during the plant operation.
While under normal conditions combustible gas with- out any oxidant is the only gas that passes through the system, it may turn out that some leakages have developed during its life which may create a good combustible mixture passing through the system.
If, at the time when the flare is operating emergency shutdown occurs, the average speed through the system k falling and at some time it can go below the flame speed.
At this time the flame will propagate up- stream and can cause undesired combustion in large volumes of gaseous mixtures, if present, leading to thermal explosion.
Figure 7.1 shows the schematic of this design.
The gas from a duct is divided into two, four (or more, if needed) paths and the exit occurs from a rectangular section where width is smaller than the quench distance.
The total cross-sectional area is made comparable to the gaseous inlet area so as not to cause any additional pressure drop in the line.
The gases coming out of the rectangular slots can be ignited and the flame maintained.
If the exit velocities are large enough to blow the flame off, this can be countered by maintaining a meshed structure to enable flame to be stablized outside.
If, now, the blower (or any other source) delivering the gases is turned down or off, the flame tends to move back (flash back).
This movement is prevented by the small cross-section where the flame extinguishes since the heat generation rate is inadequate to overcome the
Figure 7.1: A schematic for ensuring that flame does not flash back even if the gas that flows out of the slots gets premixd subsequently heat loss rate.
The two are connected with flame speeds as is amply clear from the simple expressions on quench distance and the other aspects of discussion.
Understanding these would help bring a mixture to the ignition range or take it out of it, to permit transmission of ignition from one region to another, or prevent it.
We now move on to ignition and stability of flames.
It is a matter of experience that a fuel gas can be ignited in an easier manner than a kerosene wick which in turn is easier than a solid fuel in stoves using these fuels.
Since ignition implies a flame in gaseous phase, one has to generate fuel vapours from liquid/solid before ignition can take place.
This is why it is easier to ignite a gaseous fuel.
It is more difficult to vaporise a solid compared to a liquid and that is the reason for greater difficulty in igniting solid fuels.
Aircraft engines use kerosene as a fuel.
Kerosene is usually injected as a fine spray into the combustion chamber.
Ignition is performed by a spark source.
It must be noted that the flow velocities in the combustor are by no means small, typically 20-50 m/s.
Hence it is quite difficult to re-ignite under these conditions.
Let us assume that ignition has taken place and the aircraft has flown into cruise altitude.
Suppose the aircraft moves into a zone of heavy rain and water ingestion causes a ‘flame-out’ as it is called.
It should be possible to reignite the system at this altitude and at reasonable flight speeds.
This is a tough task and if achieved, makes the engine qualify for acceptance by aircraft as a propulsion system.
To find how much must be the energy of the spark to cause ignition in such conditions and where to locate the spark in the flowing fluid requires an understanding of the processes of ignition.
We begin now to try and understand the processes during ignition.
There are two methods of ignition— (i) high energy spark, (ii) a naked flame.
The high energy spark is created between two electrodes kept at some distance away from each other.
Generating a high voltage across the electrodes (typically of the order of 10 kV) causes a breakdown of the resistance in the gaseous atmosphere and the re- gion between the electrodes is filled with ions and high energy species.
The local temperatures are also high.
These high energy species diffuse to the surroundings, recombine at a distance and generate heat.
The chemical reactions begin in the en- tire region around the spark.
Whether these reactions decay away or sustain into a propagating flame will depend on the relative levels of energy generated locally to that which is diffused away.
The minimum energy required can be estimated by calculating the energy of a flame with thickness equal to flame thickness and a cross-section of a dimension equal to quench distance.
The logic for this comes from the following observation.
If the energy of the spark is restricted to the cross-section equal to or less than the quench distance corresponding to the gas—air mixture, the
The energy of the flame is the product of the sensible enthalpy per unit mass of the gas taken from the ambient to the flame temperature and the mass of the gas confined within the quench diameter and flame thickness.
As long as the ignition energy is larger than this value, ignition will take place.
This is a steep dependence on pressure.
This value is in the right range of values determined experimentally, noting that this is an upper estimate of the limit.
Some of these values are shown in Table 8.1.
Note that these values are for a quiescent atmosphere.
If pressure is a third of the sea level pressure, as it happens for a flying aircraft, the ignition energy will be
8.1 Ignition of a Liquid Pool and solid fuels about thirty times this value, 1-2 mJ.
If now we superpose the effect of flowing stream at velocities ~20-50 m/s, the energy goes up substantially.
While actual calculations can indeed be made, the typical ratio of ignition energies with flow compared to that at quiescent conditions, is about 100 or so.
This brings the ignition energy in the range of 0.1 J or so.
Typical values of ignition energies in spark igniters of aircraft engines are about 1-2 J and this is consistent with the fact that in aircraft engines, ignition is of kerosene spray (of fine droplets) and not gaseous fuel.
Ignition by a naked flame is always easier than a spark.
A spark is a very stable source of energy especially since it is tiny and can be arranged easier.
This does not mean pilot flame ignition is not used in practice.
It is indeed used even in rocket engines.
The pilot flame is spark ignited and it becomes the ignition source for a much larger system.
8.1 Ignition of a Liquid Pool and solid fuels Under unforeseen contingencies it may happen that liquid pool gets formed.
A typical instance could be the breaking up of a fuel tanker at sea.
The entire liquid fuel spreads on the sea surface.
So we ask a question: Under what conditions does a pool of kerosene burns
You may find that the kerosene will not ignite at all.
Then even a small flame brought near the pool would quickly ignite and burn away the vapours obtained a little earlier.
What do all these mean?
For ignition one needs fuel vapours.
In the case of kerosene the boiling point is high and so vapours are found in small quantities in the region above the pool.
On the other hand, one will find more vapours on a gasoline pool even at temperatures of 20-25°C.
Therefore, bringing any tiny source of ignition is adequate to cause ignition.
These aspects are covered under the concepts of flash and fire points.
Flash point is the temperature of the liquid at which an ignition source is able
If the ignition source is taken away, the flame also will disappear.
Stated differently, the flame is not self-supporting at the flash point.
Following ignition, the heat transferred by the flame will generate enough volatiles to continue burning in the gas phase.
Igniting solid fuels is even more difficult.
Consequently, if a person wants to light a wood stove, she would douse the ends of fire wood sticks with some kerosene and then light the piece.
It is not always for sure that if you ignite the stick with kerosene the wood stick would ignite for the kerosene could burn away leaving the wood unignited.
Firstly, it must be understood that kerosene is the first to vaporise because its boiling point is about 150-200 °C.
Volatiles from wood would get generated only at 300-350 °C.
Hence it is kerosene which would burn away first.
But during this process, transfer of heat by radiation and conduction close to the flame should begin to generate volatiles from the wood and then combust it.
If this process becomes self-sustaining before the kerosene burns away, the process of ignition is successful.
For instance, if you had doused the wood pieces with gasoline instead of kerosene, there would be less chances of ignition of wood.
This is because gasoline would burn away faster and the chances that wood would generate volatiles within this time are lower.
In fact many a criminal has been unsuccessful in burning away incriminating documents by dousing them with gasoline for he had not understood combustion principles!
It is not that one needs to use kerosene for ignition.
The heat transferred is shared by the larger portions in conduction mode and the heat is simply dissipated.
Therefore, one needs to use a large number of small-sized fibrous dry sticks and ignite them with a matchstick.
The fibrous wood pieces, particularly the sharp-edged ones, will ignite immediately and the entire bunch will start burning.
They can then be put on the grate of a stove and by suitably adding additional wood pieces of slightly larger sizes, the fire can be maintained.
The energy utilized here will be close to 20 to 40 J.
8.2 Matchstick composition and ignition The common matchstick is used in many kitchens in many countries, even though it has gone out-of-vogue in other countries in favor of lighters and quartz crystal based sparking devices.
The composition used on the matchstick ignites on being rubbed against a special surface (as it happens in safety matches) and holds the flame for a time that would be needed to light a kerosene wick stove or a cigarette or other combustible substances.
The trees whose trunk is used for this purpose are usually white pine and aspen.
With an automated process, the wood is veneered (thin slices of wood come out in the form of a sheet) and matchsticks are cut.
In many cases, these are soaked in ammonium phosphate to act as a fire retardant.
This prevents the stick from smoldering after the match has gone out.
The striking end of the matchstick is dipped in hot paraffin wax to provide a small amount of fuel to transfer the flame from the burning chemicals on the tip to the matchstick itself.
Safety matches are those that embed the safety in two ways: (a) they have two components that need to be used to cause a flame.
The matchstick has a composition on its head and a surface that is separate from the stick, a different composition and (b) the very highly reactive white phosphorous that was used earlier is replaced by red phosphorous.
The striking of the matchstick against the surface causes the generation of frictional heat; this is sufficient to cause the ignition that involves, as an initial step, the conversion of a trace of red phosphorous to white phosphorous.
The compositions of the matchhead and the striking surface are not unlike those used in igniter compositions of rocket engines.
Only, they are less expensive and less reactive.
The match head is typically composed of 45-55 % potassium chlorate, with a little sulphur and starch, a neutralizer (ZnO or CaCO3), 20-40 % of siliceous filler or powdered glass, diatomiticous earth and animal glue.
Some heads contain antimony (III) sulfide so they burn more vigorously.
The striking surface is composed of typically 25 % powdered glass, 50 % red phosphorus, 5% neutralizer, 4 % carbon black and 16 % binder.
Powdered glass aids the friction to generate heat.
Inert fillers are added to give sufficient mass to maintain the fire for the required time.
Typical mass of the composition on the matchhead is about 5 to 10 mg and its calorific value is about 1.5 to 2.0 J/g.
Thus the energy of a matchstick head is about 6 to 20 J.
8.3 Ignition in Reciprocating Engines Spark Ignition Engines In engines that use gasoline fuel, the carburettor mixes the fuel spray with air and sends it on to the engine combustion chamber.
After the mixture is ingested into the chamber, at an appropriate moment in the cycle in relation to top dead centre, a spark is fired so that the ignition occurs.
The spark is created by a voltage source of 3-5 kV.
Compression Ignition Engines In such engines which use diesel fuel, the pressure ratio used is high (~15-20) so that compression causes the temperature to raise to such an extent that when liquid injection takes place, it can ignite by itself under the conditions of high pressure and temperature.
One of the important requirements in such engines is that ignition must take place very
The typical time available for combustion in an engine running at say 1500 rpm, is about 2-4 ms.
This requires the droplet to be very fine—which indeed it is.
The other condition is for environmental condition to permit ignition in the time scale of the kind indicated.
8.4 Ignition in Rocket Engines It has already been indicated that there exists combination of liquid fuels and oxidizers which on mixing will react and burst into flame.
These are the hypergolic combinations.
When the liquids are mixed, the liquid phase reactions (between UDMH and N2O4 or N2H4 and RFNA, for example) at the interface between the liquids is such that very reactive species are produced which enter the gas phase and react exothermically leading to high temperature flame.
While this feature is true in most combustion reactions, the essential point concerns the rate of re- actions.
The rate of reactions here is so large that the time between mixing and occurance of a gaseous flame is as small as 3-10 ms.
This duration between start of mixing to burst of flame is called the ignition delay.
Thus, even at extremely low pressures, when the gas phase reactions can be expected to be slow, the reactions are completed in as small a time as 20-30 ms and ignition is indeed smooth.
It is for this reason that most rocket engines that need high reliability like the lunar module engine, for instance, use only hypergolic combinations.
There are rocket engines based on liquid oxygen-liquid hydrogen (LOX-LH2) mixtures.
These engines use igniters which by themselves are small rockets ignited by spark.
Figure 8.1 shows schematically the arrangement for such an engine.
Similar arrangements need to be made for LOX-kerosene engine.
Such engines can also be made restartable if needed.
8.5 Ignition for Solid Rocket Engines In solid rocket engines there is a solid propellant (configured geometrically properly) which needs to be ignited.
Figure 8.2 shows two arrangements of propellant and ignition scheme.
In relatively small rockets, ignition is caused by an igniter charge which consists of pellets of appropriate composition.
A typical composition may be like 50 % ammonium perchorate (AP), 35 % boron or titanium and 15 % polymer.
The ignition is usually electrical—a fine wire coated with a heat sensitive explosive such as lead azide or mercuric fulminate causes ignition when an electrical current, typically 0.75-1 amp is passed through the wire.
The heat sensitive material explodes and this causes the main charge to burn fast (in about 10-30 ms).
The gases when passing through the duct along the grain, cause convective heat transfer and thus enhance the possibility of local ignition.
The flame then begins to spread across the entire surface of the propellant and steady operating conditions are achieved in about 0.3—2.5 s depending on the size of the rocket being tested.
In large-sized rockets like PSLV stage rocket of India, the igniter constitutes a rocket by itself.
Such igniters are called pyrogen igniters.
In all such cases a part of igniter products, namely gas, is expected to raise the pressure in the chamber and another to cause local ignition.
Careful design is called for to make sure that there are no over pressures during ignition and the transient blends smoothly into normal, steady operating conditions.
Ignition is the first part of any combustion process.
It is affected by the pressure and the initial temperature of the system under consideration.
Ignition delay, i.e., the time from start of the ignition process to achieving steady state should be small in systems for ignition process to be effective.
The process of ignition is more difficult at low pressures and temperatures.
In gas-phase fuel-oxidant mixtures, ignition energy is typically 0.1-0.2 mJ under quiescent conditions.
In flowing mixtures, the ignition energy increases a hundred-fold depending on velocities, local mixture
Ignition in liquids is affected by the fire point of the liquid fuel, apart from the ambient pressure and initial temperature.
Ignition in gasoline engines is spark-initiated and that in diesel engines compression-initiated.
The combined action of high temperature and pressure towards the end of the compression stroke causes ignition of the tiny liquid droplets Injected before the end of the compression stroke.
In rocket engines, hypergolic combinations for liquid engines eliminate the need for separate ignition system.
In other engines using non-self-igniting propellants, an ignition system is called for.
These are usually based on the same propellant and ignition is caused in smaller chambers with spark initiation.
The hot gases then become pilot flame for the main engine ignition.
In solid rocket engines, the igniter serves the purpose of building pressure inside the combustion chamber and also produces hot particles of metal or metal oxides which impinge on the solid propellant and create many ignition sources for the entire propellant to ignite in a small time.
Stability, Extinction and Blow-Off of Stability is a concept used in many scientific disciplines.
Invariably it means that the system in static or dynamic equilibrium gets restored to equilibrium on being displaced slightly from its original state.
This interpretation is also appropriate for flames.
There are many situations where the flame- premixed or diffusion-is subject to disturbances.
If, innspite of these disturbances, the flame gets restored to the original state when the disturbances are removed, then, the flame is said to be stable.
Let us first look at situations where the subject is relevant.
Figure 9.1 shows several such situations.
The unstable flames may move to one of the more stable states— the no-flame state.
In this case the flame is thought to be ‘extinguished’ or blown off.
Figure 9.1 (a) is shown a classical Bunsen burner used in chemical laboratories or glass blowing units.
It is quite often run on kerosene vapour and sometimes with LPG.
When one runs out of either of these, acetylene is used.
At comparable flow rates one may find that the flame flashes back in the case of acetylene-air mixture when it would not for LPG or perhaps kerosene-vapour-air mixture.
If one had designed the system for acetylene air, then allowing kerosene vapour-air to flow through causes the flame to blow off at the same flow rate.
In Figure 9.1 (b) the combustion chamber of a gas turbine engine is indicated.
