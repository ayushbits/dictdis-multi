Licensing of State and Central Co-operative Banks- Present Status
The Committee on Financial Sector Assessment ( CFSA ) ( Chairman : Dr. Rakesh Mohan ) had recommended that no unlicensed cooperative bank may be allowed to operate in the cooperative space beyond March 31 , 2012 .
However , this would need to be attained in a non- disruptive manner .
As there were a large number of cooperative banks functioning without license [ 17 out of 31 State Cooperative Banks ( StCBs ) and 296 out of 371 District Central Cooperative banks ( DCCBs ) ] , the Reserve Bank relaxed the licensing norms .
DEPOSIT INSURANCE AND CREDIT GUARANTEE CORPORATION
The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation ( DICGC ) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reserve Bank of India .
The number of insured banks as on March 31 , 2013 stood at 2,167 comprising 89 commercial banks , 67 RRBs , 4 LABs and 2,007 co-operative banks .
With the present limit of deposit insurance in India at ₹ 0.1 million , the number of fully protected accounts at 1,393 million ( as on March 31 , 2013 ) constituted 94 per cent of the total number of accounts ( 1,482 million ) as against the international benchmarks of 80 per cent .
Amount-wise , insured deposits at ₹ 21,584 billion constituted 32.6 per cent of assessable deposits at ₹ 66,211 billion against the international benchmark of 20-40 per cent .
At the current level , the insurance cover works out to 1.45 times per capita income as on March 31 , 2013 .
The provision of deposit insurance serves several purposes .
First , it secures public confidence in the banking system , thereby contributing to financial stability .
Second , deposit insurance benefits depositors , particularly small ones , through protection of their deposits , thereby contributing to the social security objective .
Third , confidence in the banking system coupled with broad access to safe and affordable small savings accounts promotes financial inclusion and helps households prepare for unexpected expenses and plan for a more secure financial future .
Deposit insurance is a very effective tool to attain financial inclusion , given the existing high level of financial exclusion around the globe , especially in the underdeveloped world and emerging and developing economies .
The Financial Stability Board ( FSB ) undertook a peer review of deposit insurance systems among its member institutions .
The report observed that the global financial crisis has illustrated the importance of effective depositor compensation arrangements .
The crisis resulted in greater convergence in practices across jurisdictions and emerging consensus about appropriate design features that include higher coverage levels , elimination of co-insurance , improvements in the payout process , greater depositor awareness , adoption of ex ante funding by more jurisdictions and strengthening of information sharing and co-ordination with other safety net participants .
In light of the operational issues surrounding microfinance and lending against collateral of gold jewellery , the guidelines issued on Fair Practices Code for such NBFCs were revised / amended .
As per the guidelines such NBFCs should put in place Board-approved grievance redressal mechanism with the name of the grievance redressal officer prominently displayed at all branches ; the Fair Practices Code in vernacular language should be prominently displayed ; there should be transparency in loan pricing , besides others .
NBFCs lending against gold jewellery have been advised to follow KYC guidelines ; have internal policies to establish ownership of gold ; have adequate security and insurance on gold collateral and have Board- approved auction policy in place .
In order to play an effective role in the financial system , deposit insurers must comply with the BCBS-IADI ' Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems ' .
In some areas , there are deviations from the ' Core Principles ' , which need to be addressed .
In some countries , including India , non-bank deposit-taking institutions do not have deposit insurance coverage .
Second , coverage limits need to be periodically examined so as to achieve a balance between financial stability and market discipline .
The deposit insurer would also need to take into consideration the value ( of deposits ) at risk and the likelihood of failure for determining the sufficiency of funds .
In addition , adequacy , timeliness and efficiency in payout are important for the deposit insurance agency , that is contingent on timely access to information .
Deposit insurance systems should regularly test the readiness and effectiveness of their payout processes .
In this regard , data systems such as the " single customer view " in the US and the UK need to be implemented in India .
The financial crisis led to the expansion of mandates in many systems .
The challenge before economies is to ensure proper co-ordination between the deposit insurer and other safety net participants , which would ensure appropriate resolution and expeditious claims settlement .
The cross-border information-sharing arrangements between deposit insurance agencies also need to be strengthened .
The margin cap for all NBFCs irrespective of their size have been revised to 12 per cent until March 31 , 2014 .
However , with effect from April 1 , 2014 margin caps may not exceed 10 per cent for large MFIs ( loans portfolios exceeding ₹ 100 crore ) and 12 per cent for the others .
Under the Act , factoring companies other than banks , Government companies etc . ( as provided in Section 5 of the Act ) would be registered with the Reserve Bank as NBFCs and would be subject to prudential regulations by the Reserve Bank .
Hence , it has been decided to introduce a new category of NBFCs viz . , Non-Banking Financial Company-Factors and separate Directions in this regard have been issued .
This Directions states , inter alia , that every company intending to undertake factoring business shall make an application for grant of certificate of registration ( CoR ) as NBFC-factor to the Reserve Bank as provided under Section 3 of the Act .
Their request must be supported by their Statutory Auditor ' s certificate indicating the asset and income pattern .
An entity not registered with the Bank may conduct the business of factoring if it is an entity mentioned in Section 5 of the Act
REGULATION , SUPERVISION AND FINANCIAL STABILITY
Based on the Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2012-13 , the definition of infrastructure lending for the purpose of financing of infrastructure by banks and financial institutions was harmonised with that in the Master List of Infrastructure sub-sectors ' notified by the Government of India on March 27 , 2012 .
Accordingly , it was decided to harmonise the definition of infrastructure lending for NBFCs with that of banks and the extant definition of infrastructure loan in the NBFC Prudential Norms Directions , 2007 stands amended .
In line with the increasing size and complexity of the financial sector , the Reserve Bank has taken steps to ensure that the laws governing the sector are in line with modern financial practices .
Accordingly , several relevant laws were amended to keep pace with the changing developments ( Box VI.7 ) .
Recommendations of the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission
Pursuant to the announcement made in the Union Budget 2010-11 , the Government of India set up the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission ( Chairman : Justice Shri B.N. Srikrishna ) , on March 24 , 2011 .
The terms of reference were wide in their ambit and included the examination of the architecture of the legislative and regulatory system governing the financial sector , besides reviewing the existing laws that govern the financial sector in India .
The Act enables the Reserve Bank to increase the ceiling on voting rights from ten to 26 per cent in a phased manner .

Volume 1 contains the analysis and recommendations of the Commission and Volume II contains the draft Indian Financial .
The Commission has proposed a financial regulatory architecture comprising of the following agencies :
Reserve Bank of India - performing three functions : monetary policy , regulation and supervision of banking and payment systems .
Unified Financial Agency - for implementing consumer protection law and microprudential law for all financial firms other than banking and payment systems .
Financial Sector Appellate Tribunal - as an appellate body that will hear appeals against the Reserve Bank for its regulatory functions , the unified financial agency , decisions of the financial redressal agency and some elements of the work of the resolution corporation .
Resolution Corporation - into which the present DICGC would be subsumed .
It would work across the financial system .
Financial Redressal Agency - as a one-stop shop where consumers can file complaints against all financial firms .
The Reserve Bank conducted government ' s market borrowing programme smoothly during 2012-13 despite tight liquidity conditions .
The weighted average yield of dated government securities declined and the weighted average maturity increased .
To encourage savings by offering better menu choices to risk-averse investors , amidst high inflation in recent years , the Reserve Bank issued inflation indexed bonds .
The financial year 2012-13 was characterised by sustained inflationary pressure and tight liquidity conditions .
The Reserve Bank , as the government ' s debt manager conducted the borrowing programme smoothly , guided by the twin objectives of minimisation of cost and pursuit of maturity profiles that are consistent with low rollover risk .
Market borrowing to the tune of ₹ 5580 billion was successfully completed .
Securities amounting ₹ 18 billion , however devolved on primary dealers as compared with ₹ 121 billion during the previous year .
The gross and net amounts raised through dated securities in 2012-13 were higher by around 9 per cent and 7 per cent , respectively than those raised in the previous year ( Table VII.1 ) .
The weighted average yield of dated securities declined to 8.36 per cent in 2012-13 compared to 8.52 per cent in 2011-12 due to easing of yield mainly for the long dated securities .
The weighted average coupon on the outstanding stock of Government dated securities , however , increased to 7.97 per cent as on March 31 , 2013 from 7.88 per cent as on March 31 , 2012 ( Table VII.2 ) .
A large volume of long dated securities was issued during the year which resulted in the average maturity of debt issuances during 2012-13 to increase to 13.50 years from 12.66 years during the previous year .
The debt management strategy should have a bouquet of instruments at its disposal for managing public debt in a cost- effective and non-disruptive manner .
IIBs have emerged as a critical instrument for government market borrowing across the developed and emerging market economies ( Table 1 ) .
Although the debt management strategy shall be using variety of instruments for successful completion of market borrowing programme , it has largely relied on fixed rate nominal bonds .
One variant of IIBs , 5 year Capital Index Bond ( CIB ) was issued on December 29 , 1997 wherein only the principal repayment at the time of redemption was indexed to inflation .
The response to the issue was , however , subdued as interest payment was not protected against inflation .
It is known fact that SLR requirement for banks and requirement of some minimum investment in G-Sec for insurance companies and provident funds provides significant captive demand for G-Sec .
The net allocation under the market borrowing programme for state governments for 2012-13 was placed at ₹ 1,881 billion .
Taking into account the repayments of ₹ 306 billion , the gross allocation amounted to ₹ 2,187 billion , while gross sanctions under Article 293 ( 3 ) amounted to ₹ 1 , 861 billion .
The 28 state governments raised a gross amount of ₹ 1,773 billion ( net ₹ 1,467 billion ) in 2012- 13 as against ₹ 1,586 billion ( net ₹ 1,366 billion ) raised by 26 states in the previous year ( Table VII.4 ) .
Odisha Government did not participate in the market borrowing programme in 2012-13 as against Assam , Odisha and Chhattisgarh in 2011-12 .
The weekly average investment of the state governments in Auction Treasury Bills ( ATBs ) increased to ₹ 441 billion from ₹ 277 billion in the previous year .
The outstanding investment in ATBs as at end-March 2013 stood at ₹ 286 billion was higher than ₹ 220 billion at end-March 2012 .
The outstanding investments under CSF and GRF amounted to ₹ 485 billion and ₹ 44 billion , respectively , as at end-March 2013 .
The report of the Committee to assess the feasibility of introducing more long-term fixed interest rate loan products by banks ( Chairman : Shri K.K. Vohra ) was placed on the Reserve Bank ' s website on January 22 , 2013 .
There has been a steady increase in the demand for banknotes and coins over the years , despite the increased use of technology-driven non-cash modes of payments during the recent period .
The Reserve Bank continued its efforts to ensure supply of good quality banknotes in pursuance of its Clean Note Policy .
Further , to increase the longevity of banknotes , the Reserve Bank 1s planning to introduce ₹ 10 plastic banknotes in five cities of India on a trial basis .
To address the challenge of counterfeit notes , the Reserve Bank tried to enhance public awareness through sensitization programmes across the country .
The Bank and Government of India together , have initiated various measures to strengthen the security features and design of banknotes .
Managing currency is one of the core functions of the Reserve Bank , being the central bank of India .
Although coins of all denominations are issued by the government , they are put into circulation through the Reserve Bank .
The Reserve Bank is the sole authority for issuing banknotes in India under Section 22 of the Reserve Bank of India Act , 1934 .
Although there is a rising trend of using technology- driven non-cash modes of payment , the demand for banknotes and coins has been rising .
The Reserve Bank , in accordance with the pace of demand for banknotes , tries to ensure a steady supply of clean banknotes as per its Clean Note Policy .
It also continues its efforts to strengthen the security features of banknotes and enhance public awareness of banknotes , for which it has initiated various sensitisation programmes .
To ensure adequate quantity of banknotes and coins in the system and to ascertain better quality and the genuineness of banknotes , the Reserve Bank took several steps during 2012-13 .
Keeping in view the increase in demand for banknotes , the Reserve Bank placed an enhanced indent during 2012-13 .
Soiled and unfit banknotes were removed from circulation and disposed of in an eco-friendly manner by shredding and briquetting them .
The government has initiated the process of selecting new features for the next series and the Reserve Bank is actively associated with this activity .
Simultaneously , the Reserve Bank initiated the process of reviewing the banknote designs in consultation with the Government .
To promote a reporting system for counterfeit notes , the administrative and legal procedures are being simplified .
Further , as part of its Clean Note Policy , the Reserve Bank has been exploring alternatives for enhancing the life of banknotes , such as plastic notes , which will be introduced on a trial basis in select Indian cities ( Box VIII.1 ) .
To increase the circulation life of banknotes , particularly in small denominations , the Reserve Bank , in consultation with Government of India , considered various options , including printing banknotes on plastic substrate .
Accordingly , it has decided to introduce one billion pieces of ₹ 10 banknotes on plastic substrate for field trials in five cities , viz . , Jaipur , Bhubaneswar , Kochi , Shimla and Mysore , which have been identified because of their geographic and climatic diversity .
Australia was the first country to introduce polymer notes in 1988 .
Since then , over 30 countries have introduced polymer banknotes , of which several have completely switched from paper to polymer .
The latest entrant is Canada , where notes for denominations of CAD 20 , 50 and 100 are already in circulation and notes for denominations of 5 and 10 will be put into circulation in November 2013 .
Currency Chests with sub-treasury offices are being gradually phased out and their number was 11 as on December 31 , 2012 .
As at end-December 2012 , the State Bank of India and its associates accounted for the highest share of around 70 per cent of Currency Chests , followed by the nationalised banks with 27 per cent ( Table VIII.3 ) .
Of the counterfeit notes detected by the Reserve Bank in 2012-13 , around 79 per cent ( 23,093 pieces ) were detected in the soiled note remittances by banks and about 21 per cent ( 6,107 pieces ) were tendered over Reserve Bank counters .
During 2012-13 , the detection of counterfeit notes in the denomination of ₹ 1000 increased by 18.2 per cent , whereas detection of counterfeit ₹ 500 and ₹ 100 notes decreased by 6.8 per cent and 12.3 per cent , respectively , in comparison with the previous year ( Table VIII.8 ) .
A roadmap for enhancing the processing capacity of soiled notes through the Currency Verification and Processing System ( CVPS ) for the period 2012-13 to 2014-15 has been worked out to attain the objectives of the Clean Note Policy and maintain the average life cycle of banknotes .
Of the 59 CVPS in the Reserve Bank offices , which have an annual processing capacity of 7.5 billion pieces ,
The remaining 20 machines are being upgraded from 20 to 30 notes per second .
There are also 28 Shredding and Briquetting Systems ( SBS ) in the Reserve Bank .
Of these , the capacity of 5 machines has been enhanced , and another 13 machines will be upgraded / overhauled during the next 12 to 15 months .
Encourage opening of currency chests in the rural and semi-urban areas
The Reserve Bank continued its efforts in making the payment systems more secure and efficient .
Efforts were also made to make the payment systems more affordable for users and to widen their reach beyond the existing levels to achneve the goal of financial inclusion .
During the year , the Reserve Bank continued its endeavours to improve the IT infrastructure with a view to facilitating the Indian banking sector ' s alignment with the latest technological innovations .
Cheque Truncation System , introduced in the year 2008 , has also shown substantial growth during the year , thus consolidating the paper-based clearing structure in the country .
Overall , the payment and settlement systems registered healthy growth , with volumes and value growing at 15.0 per cent and 29.7 per cent , respectively , on y-o-y basis compared with the growth of 9.0 per cent and 23.2 per cent , respectively during the previous year .
The application package ' Express Cheque Clearing Systems ' ( ECCS ) that was introduced in 2011 for non-MICR clearing houses is now available at 1,269 centres and offers a speed clearing facility .
The grid-based Cheque Truncation System introduced in March 2012 in Chennai , has been extended to cover image-based clearing operations across the states of Tamil Nadu , Kerala , Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh , as well as cities such as Kolkata , Ludhiana , Puducherry and Chandigarh .
As part of the national roll-out , CTS clearing operations in Mumbai commenced in April 27 , 2013 .
The Real Time Gross Settlement System ( RTGS ) processed transactions to a settlement value of around ₹ 8 trillion on March 28 , 2013 , which is the highest value settled through RTGS on a business day .
To ensure interruption-free operations under all circumstances , disaster recovery drills for RTGS systems are conducted on a quarterly basis .
With the addition of 18,257 branches during the year , the coverage of the National Electronic Clearing Service ( NECS ) has been increased to 75,659 locations as at the end of July 2013 .
The Regional Electronic Clearing Service ( RECS ) system introduced in various Reserve Bank centres has seen expansion in branch coverage during the year .
The removal of transaction limits on mobile banking and the raising of limits for transactions that can be sent without end-to-end encryption have contributed to this increase .
As at end-May 2013 , 44 entities are operating various payment systems in the country , which included a financial market infrastructure organisation - the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd . ( CCIL ) , the National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) , card payment networks ( VISA , MasterCard , RuPay , etc . ) , automated teller machine ( ATM ) networks , cross-border in-bound money transfer services and pre-paid payment instrument ( PPI ) issuers .
To accelerate the growth and penetration of ATMs in the country , the Reserve Bank , in June 2012 , issued guidelines on the entry of non-bank entities into the space of ATM operations , which have been christened White Label ATMs ( WLAs ) .
Of these , 12 entities have been granted in- principle approval and one entity has been issued a Certificate of Authorisation .
The first WLA was operationalised at Chandrapada ( tier-V town ) , Maharashtra on June 27 , 2013 .
The Reserve Bank published the Vision Document for payment systems , laying down the roadmap for payment systems in the country for the next three years , i.e. , 2012-15 ( Box IX.1 )
In order to further enhance the speed of decline in usage of cheques , a discussion paper on " Disincentivising Issuance and Usage of Cheques " was prepared and placed on the website for comments from the public .
Two efficiency enhancement features were introduced in the National Electronic Funds Transfer ( NEFT ) system .
An additional batch at 8 : 00 AM was introduced , taking the total number of batches to 12 on weekdays and 6 on Saturdays .
To facilitate the migration of small-value transactions from cash or cheque to NEFT , customer charges for transactions up to ₹ 10,000 were reduced to ₹ 2.50 .
Adoption of uniform routing code and uniform account number structure
While the RTGS and NEFT systems use the Indian Financial System Code ( IFSC ) , the ECS , cheque clearing systems use the Magnetic Ink Character Recognition ( MICR ) code and cross-border transactions use the SWIFT Branch Identifier Codes ( BIC ) .
Another suggestion was to consolidate the multiple routing codes ( MICR , IFSC , SWIFT , BIC ) to enable interoperability among payment systems .
Similarly , the structure of customer account numbers varied across banks in terms of length , pattern , composition and presence of cheque digits .
This hampered even basic validations on account numbers during origination of payment transactions .
To study these issues and provide recommendations , the Reserve Bank constituted a Technical Committee ( Chairman : Shri Vijay Chugh ) in August 2012 to examine :
the harmonisation of all existing bank / branch codes
While analysing the issues , the Committee aimed to achieve the objective of standardisation while ensuring that the changes required in banks ' systems and processes would be minimised and cause the least inconvenience to customers .
The Committee submitted its report in December 2012 .
The main recommendations of the Committee are :
In view of validation checks built around branch identifier in IFSC by a large number of banks to prevent credits going to wrong accounts , the Committee recommended its continuation .
The IFSC is best suited for routing purposes in payment systems in the current scenario and as such it may continue to be used .
Further , in order to limit the number to existing level , the Committee recommended that any new payment system should use only the IFSC for routing purposes .
The Committee recommended the implementation of IBAN in banks as it would bring in uniformity and also enhance the efficiency in systems that use account numbers as a Critical input for successful processing of payment transactions .
The Committee recommended 26-characters long IBAN with alpha bank-id as it will require minimum changes across banks .
However , the Committee noted that IBAN will not bring in portability of accounts across banks .
The recommendations of the Committee are under consideration of the Reserve Bank of India .
The Reserve Bank has been seeking to enhance the safety and security of card payment transactions - both Card Present ( CP ) and Card Not Present ( CNP ) transactions .
In addition , the Reserve Bank has also issued necessary instructions for securing CP transactions based on the recommendations of a Working Group which submitted its report in May 2011 .
The Working Group inter-alia suggested evaluation of the usefulness of Aadhaar as additional factor of authentication ( AFA ) for card present transactions .
Accordingly , based on the results of the Pilot conducted at New Delhi in December 2012-January 2013 , a Working Group has been formed to study the feasibility of Aadhaar as an AFA for CP transactions and other related issues .
PAYMENT AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
In earlier days , a payment was made by sending a cheque to the payee and payee deposited the cheque in his / her bank for credit to his / her account .
Later on , there came a facility by which the payer himself could deposit the cheque in his / her bank for credit to payee ' s account .
These were termed as " payer " initiated payment and were known as GIRO .
In India , although a wide range of payment instruments and payment channels are currently available in the country , there is no dedicated system for facilitating bill payment where cheque and cash still occupy a major place .
Committee to Recommend Implementation of GIRO-based Payment Systems in India
In line with the objective set out in the Payment Systems Vision ( 2012-15 ) , a Committee ( Chairman Shri G. Padmanabhan ) was set up to finalise the modalities of implementing the GIRO payment system -both electronic and cheque based , in India .
The Committee released the report in April 2013 .
Bill payments , including utility bills and other payments related to school fees , examination fees , government payments , pre- paid payment instruments top-ups , mobile phone recharge / top-up , insurance premia , taxes etc. form a major component of retail payment transactions space .
Despite the availability of a wide range of payments instruments and channels , there are significant operational and cost inefficiencies in the bill collection processes .
It is estimated that over 30,800 million bills are generated each year in just the top 20 cities in the country and almost 90 per cent of these are estimated to be collected through cash / cheque with a very small share of electronic payments through ECS etc .
Other suggestions given in the Report are :
Bill Presentment : IDRBT could develop an appropriate algorithm for capturing bill data to bring in standardisation of bills .
IBPS should support the prevalent paper mode of bill presentment but should encourage electronic
Bill Information flow : Under IBPS , payment information should flow online to minimise reconciliation issues and customer grievances .
Payment instruments / channels : The IBPS should facilitate acceptance of payments through IVRS , net banking , mobile banking and enable acceptance of all payment modes including cash at the IBPS points .
Customer Support : IBPS will provide for online registration of complaints from customers and the first point of contact ( bank branches / customer service point receiving the payment ) would provide customer support .
Grievances related to bill payment will have to be attended to by the biller while IBPS / aggregator would provide the necessary support to the billers in this regard .
The Committee recommended that a separate organisation needs to be set up to operate and manage the IBPS ina professional manner and run on commercial lines which may be authorised by the Reserve Bank under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act , 2007 .
Clearing Corporation of India Limited ( CCIL )
The Reserve Bank is committed to the adoption and implementation of the international standards and best practices in payment systems including , the new CPSS-IOSCO standards ' Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures ( PFMls ) ' .
During the year , CCIL has implemented several measures to strengthen its risk management framework which includes complete revamp of the margining system in securities segment , implementation of changes to forex forwards regulations pertaining to exit option for members , resignation by members , limited liability for members and computation of default fund etc .
CCIL during the year conducted two rounds of trade compression in IRS / FRA which resulted in early termination of trades .
Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems ( CPSS )
Additionally , CPSS-IOSCO has published the disclosure framework for promoting consistent and comprehensive public disclosure by FMIs and an assessment methodology that would provide guidance for monitoring and assessing observance with the PFMls .
CPSS has also published a report on " Innovations in retail payments " which provides an overview of innovative retail payment activities in the CPSS and several other countries and identifies a number of exogenous and endogenous factors that could serve as drivers for retail payment innovations or as barriers to them .
The report also identifies a number of issues for central banks including the increasing role played by non-banks in retail payments for which a separate CPSS Working Group ( Chairman Shri G. Padmanabhan ) has been setup .
Technical Support to SAARC Countries
The Reserve Bank , as part of the SAARC initiatives has been providing technical support to the member countries .
Banks have adopted different strategies for putting in place systems and processes to achieve the above .
By March 2013 , most of the banks have implemented suitable solutions to generate all the returns to be submitted to the Reserve Bank .
The ADF project has been considerably successful in sensitising the banks on the need for ensuring data quality and consistency in regulatory reporting .
The Reserve Bank is closely monitoring the progress in this regard .
In this context , it is imperative that the regulator has sufficient information in the form of dashboards , score-cards and reports on almost real time basis to make timely policy decisions and act proactively .
The initiative of ADF is a first step in this direction .
The next focus would be on analytics .
Withincreased use of information technology ( IT ) infrastructure by banks , there is a need to examine the issue of shared IT resources in order to optimise costs while maintaining the desired levels of efficiency and security .
The feasibility of such shared resources by the banking sector needs to be explored wherever possible , taking into account security issues , data integrity and confidentiality .
One such avenue is cloud computing .
Cloud computing is a large-scale parallel and distributed computing system .
It consists of a collection of interconnected and virtualised computing resources that are managed to be one or more unified computing resources .
A cloud broadly has three segments in its structure : application , storage and connectivity .
Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS ) : This is the most basic cloud service model .
Here , the cloud providers offer computers , either as physical or as virtual machines , and provide storage , firewalls , networks and load balancers .
IaaS providers supply these resources on demand from their large pools installed in data centres .
This can be done in local area networks or in wide area networks , where the internet can be used for connectivity .
Essential Characteristics of the Cloud :
A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities , such as server time and network storage , as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider .
Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms ( e.g. , mobile phones , tablets , laptops , and workstations ) .
The provider ' s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model , with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand .
Examples of resources include storage , processing , memory , and network bandwidth .
PSS aims to build adequate security in the perimeter of the network to avoid attacks from network packet sniffers , IP spoofing , denial of service , password attack , application layer attack , BOT attack efc .
It ultimately aims to protect the organisation from all external threats and attacks from outside cyber world .
Information Security Operations Centre ( iSOC )
For a multi-faceted institution such as the Reserve Bank , the organisational systems and controls need to be robust so as to ensure that the system functions along sound lines .
In this regard , the Reserve Bank has taken several initiatives to strengthen its communications policy , besides improving the governance standards and pursuing its efforts to nurture a dedicated work force . Several conferences , seminars and outreach programmes were organised during the year which facilitated the process of knowledge sharing as also discussion and debate about issues of topical interest among employees and outside experts .
GOVERNANCE , HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT AND ORGANISATIONAL MANAGEMENT
The discussions generally covered issues such as extension of banking services in unbanked / under banked areas , use of IT-enabled banking services / Electronic Benefit Transfer ( EBT ) , measures to promote financial inclusion , enhancing credit flow , development of Self Help Groups ( SHGs ) , improving credit-deposit ratio and measures to enhance the quality , accessibility and integrity of banknotes .
Directors / Members of the Central Board / Local Boards - Changes

An all-India Reserve Bank inter-school quiz - RBIQ - was launched in 2012 .
This initiative is in line with the emerging consensus that any attempt at expanding the outreach of financial education needs to start at the school level .
Improving basic financial education through an interesting , effective and popular format such as a quiz contest at the school level has the potential to build a solid foundation for financial literacy .
It is felt that the RBIQ will become a major awareness and sensitisation exercise on the role of the Reserve Bank and the banking system across the country , particularly for a vast segment of our youth .
The main objectives of organising RBIQ are as under :
To create awareness and interest in the history and role of Reserve Bank , banking and finance , other banking institutions , economics , current affairs , personalities and events that have contributed to the growth and progress of India over the years ;
To build a connect between Reserve Bank and the student community across the country and achieve extensive dissemination of financial literacy ;
Designed as an informative , educational and enjoyable quiz event , RBIQ was held at 32 locations across the country .
RBIQ 2012 helped to build a connect with the young student community enrolled in schools across the country and achieve deepening of the financial literacy efforts .
In 2013 , it is planned to hold RBIQ at 12 more locations , i.e. a total of 44 locations spread across the country .
Students in standards 9-12 across all Boards would be eligible to participate in RBIQ .
RBIQ consists of questions on the Reserve Bank and Indian banking history , banking , accounting , finance , trade and commerce , India ' s economy , economics , common business terms , India ' s achievements over the years , General Knowledge and current affairs .
Towards this end , a need was felt to innovate on the inclusion initiatives by exploring the potential of sensitising and involving young Direct Recruit Officers of the Reserve Bank .
This would better integrate the human resources as also bring in fresh , implementable ideas into the Reserve Bank ' s overall endeavour for financial inclusion .

The accounting year 2012-13 concluded with a surplus of ₹ 618.04 billion , reflecting an increase of 43.6 per cent over the corresponding figure of ₹ 430.40 billion for the previous year .
While the income earned from investments in foreign assets increased modestly reflecting the decline in interest rates in international markets , the earnings from domestic assets increased significantly , mainly due to the increased portfolio of Government of India securities .
The total income , before transfer to Contingency Reserve and Asset Development Reserve and excluding unrealised gains and losses directly adjusted in relevant accounts at ₹ 743.58 billion , registered an increase of 39.8 per cent over the year 2011-12 .
The total expenditure , at ₹ 125.49 billion , represented an increase of 23.8 per cent over the previous year ' s expenditure of ₹ 101.37 billion .
by 8.2 per cent , to ₹ 23,907 billion during the Reserve Bank ' s accounting year 2012-13 ( July-June ) .
On the assets side , this was explained by an increase in the Reserve Bank ' s holding of domestic securities , loans and advances as well as foreign assets .
The increase in domestic assets by 14 per cent was mainly on account of purchases of Government securities worth ₹ 919.3 billion during the year through open market operations .
The value of gold reserves , however , fell by 11.3 per cent on account of decline in international gold prices .
On the liabilities side , the expansion of the balance sheet is explained by the rise in notes in circulation by 8.9 per cent , besides accretion to the Currency and Gold Revaluation Account ( CGRA ) by 9.9 per cent .
Technical Committee to review the form of presentation of the Balance Sheet and Profit & Loss Account
The Technical Committee examined various aspects of the form and presentation of the financial statements of the Reserve Bank , with particular reference to their readability , information content , conformity to the International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) , in addition to conducting a comparative analysis of the financial statements of other major central banks .
Some of the major recommendations are :
Nomenclature and form of the Profit & Loss Account
The ' Profit & Loss Account ' may henceforth be called ' Income Statement ' .
A single Profit & Loss account ( or as per nomenclature recommended , ' Income Statement ' ) may continue to be prepared for the Bank as a whole .
Since interest income is the major source of income for the Bank , all items of anon interest earning nature be grouped under a single head and be shown as ' Other Income ' .
While RBI should prepare its financial statements generally in accordance with International Accounting Standard ( IAS ) / International Financial Reporting Standard ( IFRS ) , it may make such departures as it considers appropriate .
THE RESERVE BANK ' S ACCOUNTS FOR 2012-13
Currently disclosures are made both in the Reserve Bank ' s Annual Report chapter on ' The Reserve Bank ' s Accounts ' and also in the ' Significant Accounting Policies and Notes to the Accounts ' attached to the financial statements .

Department increased from ₹ 2.21 billion as at June 30 , 2012 to ₹ 2.36 billion as at June 30 , 2013 , registering a marginal increase of 6.8 per cent .

The growth in real GDP at market prices increased modestly to 5 per cent during 2013-14 led by a pickup in exports coupled with a decline in imports .
The contribution of net exports to overall growth increased significantly in 2013-14 .
Statistical measures indicate that while the trend growth rate of real fixed investment had peaked in mid-2005-06 , it declined markedly thereafter largely on account of the structural bottlenecks that choked investments .
Investment Cycles in India and the Recent Downturn Empirical evidence suggests that both structural and cyclical factors have caused investment to slow down in recent years .
Moreover , these two factors have reinforced each other .
The trend component has declined since mid-2005-06 , largely reflecting the impact of structural impediments .
The empirical analysis based on quarterly data over the past fourteen years also reveals that fiscal imbalances , fuel inflation , world growth ( as a proxy for external demand ) and the monetary policy stance impact the cyclical component of real fixed investment growth .
The trend component of real investment in India was estimated using the Hodrick-Prescott ( HP ) filter on the deseasonalised series of real gross fixed capital formation ( GFCF ) adopting a growth cycle approach .
The cyclical component of investment was extracted by subtracting the estimated trend growth from its actual growth over the period 1997-98 : Q1 to 2013-14 : Q4 .
The series of the growth cycle Growth Cycle of Real Fixed Investment and trend growth of real fixed investment is shown in the chart below .
The time period was divided into three phases , based on the generally evolving path of real GDP growth .
In Phase I , the rate of investment growth alternated , exceeding and remaining below trend for nearly the same number of quarters .
On the other hand , the investment growth generally remained above trend in Phase II but dipped below trend for the larger part in Phase Ill .
The cyclical component of real investment growth dipped and turned negative especially since Q1 of 2012-13 .
The sectoral composition of fixed investment shows that the private corporate sector accounted for most of the reduction in the overall investment rate in recent years particularly in ' machinery and equipment .
In line with the observation on following trend growth in investment a recent study by Anand and Tulin ( 2014 ) also highlights the importance of economic policy uncertainity and deteriorating business confidence in the recent investment slowdown .
Interest rates appears to explain a smaller portion of investment slowdown .
Further work will be necessary to examine the contribution of specific factors , like delays in land acquisition and environment clearances , reduction in the marginal productivity of capital despite lower real interest rates , weak business confidence and policy uncertainty that may have adversely impacted the growth rate of real investment .
Over the previous decade , productivity changes may have had a significant impact on the growth rate for the Indian economy .
India KLEMS ( Capital , Labour , Energy , Material and Services ) project study has shown significant productivity improvements in the previous decade up to 2008-09 .
Much of this period overlapped the high growth phase in the Indian economy .
The Reserve Bank ' s preliminary estimates showed that the household financial saving rate Productivity Growth in India Productivity improvement remains an important contributory factor in the overall growth process .
Empirical studies relating to productivity growth in India largely relate to the 1980s and 1990s .
While these studies differ in terms of the methodology used , some of the studies based on the growth accounting framework , reveal that there was a sharp acceleration in the rate of total factor productivity ( TFP ) growth in the Indian economy after 1980 .
Further , the rate of growth in TFP in the post-reform period is found to be even higher than that in the 1980s , mainly due to improved productivity performance of the services sector .
Recent estimates on TFP growth for 26 industries and at the aggregate level have been prepared for the period 1980- 81 to 2008-09 under the aegis of India KLEMS research project ( RBI , 2014 ) which indicate that the TFP increased significantly in the 2000s ( up to 2008-09 ) as compared to the previous two decades .
The increase in TFP at the economy level in the 2000s was primarily due to manufacturing , electricity and services sectors .
In agriculture and mining sectors , however , the rate of TFP growth decelerated in the 2000s .
In the case of construction , the steep fall in TFP growth during 1980-99 was largely arrested in the 2000s .
Looking at the reasons for productivity growth , the opening up of the economy post-1991 has been identified as an important factor which resulted in a significant jump in services sector productivity which continued during the 2000s .
The electricity sector is found to have economised on the use of energy and services input in 2000s raising the value added per kilowatt hour of production .
The manufacturing sector has seen a more broad-based phenomenon of productivity growth with 8 out of 14 industries showing faster productivity growth during 2000-08 .
The liberal market reforms in the 1990s seem to have helped in the accumulation of capital in some segments of manufacturing immediately after the reforms , while opening up to foreign technology and import of capital goods might have translated into better productivity gains in the latter period ( 2000s ) ( Das , 2014 ) .
In some other studies , increase in manufacturing productivity in 2000s has been attributed to factors , such as , removal of trade barriers and increasing openness .
Infrastructure facilities as well as labour market conditions also exerted a significant influence on technical efficiency and productivity growth of manufacturing industries in India .
As productivity might have been adversely impacted over the last 3 years , going forward , removing infrastructure bottlenecks and labour market rigidities holds the key to improving output growth vis-a-vis factor accumulation .
Continuing relocation of labour out of low productivity sectors to high productivity sectors is also akin to increase in productivity .
In India , although there is some migration from agriculture , there is a need to create further employment opportunities in industrial and services sectors to ensure gainful employment of migrated labour and for enhancing overall productivity level .
During 2013-14 , the recent thrust to infrastructure spending is expected to boost productivity along with employment .
Further , the opening up of various sectors to FDI will promote greater competition and productivity .

Several measures taken by the Reserve Bank and the government helped stabilise the economy .
With greater political stability , commitment to fiscal consolidation , strengthening of the monetary policy framework and better policy implementation , GDP growth is expected to be around 5.5 per cent in 2014-15 from the sub-5 per cent growth in the preceding two years .
The disinflationary momentum that set in since December 2013 has taken inflation to a lower trayectory , broadly in line with the Reserve Bank ' s projections .
However , downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation arise from the sub-normal monsoon and the geopolitical situation in the Middle East .
To secure a sustainable growth of at least 7 per cent over the medium term , microeconomic policies that improve activity levels and productivity will be needed so that they can work in tandem with a supportive macroeconomic regime with a reasonably positive real interest rate , low inflation , moderate CAD and low fiscal deficit .
The Indian economy stands at crossroads that could take it from a slow bumpy lane to a faster highway .
Some acceleration is likely in 2014-15 that could take the growth to around 5.5 per cent .
Deficiency in rainfall during the 2014 monsoon season so far poses some downside risks , but overall growth in 2014-15 is likely to be better than previous year with likely revival in industrial and construction activities .
The improvement in the monsoon since mid-July will also help contain crop output losses .
With greater political stability and a supportive policy framework , investment could turn around .
The economy is poised to make a shift to a higher growth trajectory .
This prompted the Reserve Bank and the government to take several measures to stabilise the economy .
Monetary and fiscal policies , therefore , need to maintain caution during 2014-15 so that the gains in macro-stability are preserved and the disinflationary momentum gathers traction .
While the Reserve Bank of India ' s accounting year is July-June , data on a number of variables are available on a financial year basis , i.e. , April-March , and hence , the data are analysed on the basis of the financial year .
Where available , the data have been updated beyond March 2014 .
For the purpose of analysis and for providing proper perspective on policies , reference to past years as also prospective periods , wherever necessary , has been made in this Report .
Meanwhile , microeconomic policies covering reforms in the areas of industry , services , international trade , labour markets , public sector management , financial markets and competition are needed to work towards improving activity levels and productivity .
This approach can deliver a sustainable growth of at least 7 per cent in a non-inflationary manner once global growth normalise .
The economy coped with challenges on growth , inflation and financial stability front through several government policy initiatives and the Reserve Bank ' s role in this is documented in the rest of the chapters of this Report that cover the review of economic policies ( Part | ) and Reserve Bank operations ( Part II ) .
As the year progressed , it became clear that the macroeconomic fragilities were getting under control and the outlook for 2014-15 appeared to be better .
While the value added in mining and manufacturing contracted , services sector growth remained unchanged .
The low overall growth reflected contracting fixed investment and slowing consumption , though there was an improvement in export growth aided by rupee depreciation and contraction in imports due to subdued demand conditions and policies to dissuade gold imports .
The weak business sentiment , infrastructure bottlenecks , low public investment , domestic political uncertainty and an uneven global recovery led private fixed investment to contract .
The uncertainty in the legal and regulatory framework in key areas such as environmental clearances , land acquisition and use of natural resources , especially mining activity , added to the low business confidence and affected investments in the economy .
Private final consumption expenditure moderated on account of low income growth and high inflation .
Macro instability , however , diminished considerably with the narrowing of the twin deficits- both current account and fiscal- and the gradual reduction in inflation .
Inflation declined during latter months of 2013- 14 , but remains above the level that could 1.6 Headline consumer price index ( CPI ) inflation generally increased during June-November 2013 driven largely by food price increases .
The spike in vegetable prices , especially of onions , led to CPI inflation peaking at 11.2 per cent in November 2013 .
Food price corrections , largely on account of seasonal moderation in vegetable prices drove a subsequent fall in CPI inflation to 8.3 per cent in March 2014 .
Apart from the pressure from rising food prices , the sharp depreciation of the rupee in the H1 of 2013-14 led to pass-through effects , especially in the case of freely priced fuel products .
Staggered revisions in administered prices of diesel also added to inflationary impulses .
Even more worryingly , CPI excluding food and fuel segment inflation remained sticky at around 8 per cent for most of 2013-14 .
Double digit inflation in housing and ' others ' sub-category , which largely includes services , were the major drivers of inflation in this segment .
Food price pressures witnessed in 2013-14 despite a normal monsoon raised concerns over supply chain inefficiencies as well as the need for improving the agro-marketing infrastructure in the country .
Sharp swings in vegetable prices often have a destabilising impact on inflation expectations and concomitantly raise the general level of prices .
Increased input costs , driven by sticky nominal wages in rural areas partly fuelled by high food inflation and full indexation of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act ( MGNREGA ) wages , also pointed to the role of wage-price spiral in keeping inflation elevated and persistent .
Administered price revisions in fuel , have pushed up inflation in the short run , but have also reduced fiscal pressure and thereby medium- term inflation risks .
Twin deficit risks tamed in 2013-14 1.8 Twin deficit concerns that were the source of macro-economic fragilities during 2011-12 and 2012-13 moderated during 2013-14 .
Central government finances continued to improve in 2013- 14 with the gross fiscal deficit ( GFD ) at 4.5 percent of GDP lower than 4.8 per cent budgeted for the year and also realised for 2012-13 .
Containing GFD at this level helped in demand management and in providing credibility to the fiscal consolidation commitment in a year when risks of contagion came to the fore .
However , notwithstanding the headline numbers , some concerns about the quality of fiscal adjustment remain .
Achievement of budgetary targets was made possible by a sharp cutback in expenditures and higher non-tax revenues , aided in a large part by higher dividend receipts from various public sector enterprises ( PSEs ) and public sector banks ( PSBs ) .
While many PSEs were already cash rich with inadequate investment plans , it is important to ensure that this practice does not affect the internal financing or reserves of the public enterprises that could hamper their investments in the future .
Non-plan expenditure remained broadly at the budgeted level , although expenditure on major subsidies exceeded budgetary targets .
Capital expenditure was lower than budget estimates by 18 per cent .
Cuts in capital outlays have potential adverse implications for growth in the medium-term , as public investment is critical to crowd-in private investment against the backdrop of two years of subdued private sector activity .
Though the current account deficit was large in Q1 of 2013-14 at 4.9 per cent of GDP , a correction in CAD subsequently helped compress full year CAD to 1.7 per cent of GDP .
This transformation after two years of wide CAD was brought about by a confluence of domestic policy efforts and better global conditions , with a resultant steep fall in imports and some improvement in exports .
Imports declined mainly due to a fall in gold imports induced by a significant decline in international gold prices and policy curbs on its imports .
Similarly , softening of international commodity prices such as oil , fertilisers and coal along with a slowdown in the domestic economy contributed to a fall in imports .
The improvement in exports was supported by improvements in partner countries ' growth and a more depreciated rupee .
The year 2014-15 has begun on a promising note .
Index of Industrial Production ( IIP ) growth is beginning to look up , while inflation on an average , so far , has been lower than in the corresponding period of the previous year .
Monetary policy is providing a more stable environment in terms of interest rates , liquidity and credit conditions , with tangible efforts to improve resource flow to productive sectors .
The latter includes cuts in statutory liquidity ratio ( SLR ) and exemptions from regulatory pre-emptions such as cash reserve ratio ( CRR ) , SLR and priority sector lending ( PSL ) for issuing long-term bonds to finance loans to infrastructure and affordable housing .
The Union Budget aims to keep the economy on the path of fiscal consolidation .
However , strict adherence to fiscal discipline to avoid overshooting of expenditures and concerted efforts to mobilise tax and non-tax revenues , as also strong efforts on non-debt capital receipts will be necessary to attain these fiscal targets .
Export growth has improved , while capital inflows remain adequate .
Further , there has been a healthy accretion to foreign exchange reserves that helps insulate the economy against prospective shocks that may be transmitted onshore .
The spike in global oil price following the civil war in Iraq was transitory .
Upside risks to the oil prices , however , remain in the event of underlying geopolitical tensions resurfacing more strongly in the Gulf region .
Overall , the exchange rate has been stable so far in 2014-15 .
The Indian economy could grow in the range of 5 to 6 per cent in 2014-15 with risks broadly in balance around the central estimate of 5.5 per cent .
This is broadly in line with the projections made by the Reserve Bank at the start of 2014-15 , though risks to the central estimate were more on the downside at that point .
Signs of improvement in mining and manufacturing activity , expected pickup in investment , improved availability of financial resources to private sector with lower draft of government on financial savings of the households amid fiscal consolidation , improved external demand and stabilising global commodity prices are expected to support recovery .
However , downside risks could play out if global recovery slows , geopolitical tensions intensify or monsoon weakens again in the rest of the season .
All-India cumulative rainfall deficiency in the current monsoon season till August 13 , 2014 was placed at 18 per cent of the long period average ( LPA ) , as against an excess of 12 per cent in the corresponding period last year .
There has been a marked improvement in the monsoon since mid-July when the deficiency was 43 per cent .
Area sown under kharif crops ( till August 14 ) was 2.3 per cent lower than the normal and was 8.9 per cent higher than the 2009 drought year .
Based on the sowing data , it appears that the drop in output may now be restricted mainly to coarse cereals and pulses .
As on August 13 , the level in the 85 major reservoirs was 14 per cent higher than the average over the last 10 years , though it was 12 per cent lower than last year ' s level on the comparable date .
Even if the rainfall is normal in the rest of the monsoon season , some rainfall deficiency will stay .
However , its adverse impact on growth , inflation , fiscal and trade deficits is expected to be small as on the current reckoning , the deficiency in quantitative and qualitative terms is likely to be much less than that in 2009 .
On an average basis for the last five years , rabi crop accounted for 50.7 per cent of total foodgrains output .
As such , the odds are that agriculture and allied sector could make a positive contribution to overall growth as was the case even in 2009-10 .
In case the monsoon weakens again in the rest of the season , there is risk of modest adverse impact on electricity production .
This is because reservoir levels could fall short of their full capacities .
However , overall prospects for electricity generation remains encouraging despite the likelihood of hydro-power generation decelerating from 18.6 per cent growth registered in the previous year .
In the thermal segment that accounts for nearly 82 per cent of power generation , new capacities planned for the year are expected to add 8.9 per cent to overall installed thermal capacity .
Similarly , installed nuclear power Low Rainfall and Its Consequences The India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) in August 2014 updated its forecast of southwest monsoon rainfall to 87 per cent of the long period average ( LPA ) , from 93 per cent given in June 2014 .
The probability of monsoon to be deficient ( < 90 per cent ) is now less at 68 per cent .
Till August 13 , 2014 cumulative rainfall was 82 per cent of LPA .
Prospects of drought in some parts of the country exist .
There is no unique definition of a drought .
IMD focuses on meteorological droughts and classifies all-India drought years as those with overall rainfall deficiency of 10 per cent or more and drought area exceeding 20 per cent of the total plain areas .
While , Indian agriculture has become more resilient in recent years , rainfall deficiency and its uneven distribution over time and space continues to have a significant bearing on crop production .
Historically , whenever rainfall was deficient by 10 per cent or more , kharif foodgrains production , mainly rice and coarse cereals , declined .
Major rabi crops being well irrigated were less impacted ( Table 1 ) .
Since 1980 , there have been four all-India drought years as per the IMD ' s definition ( Table 2 ) .
In all these years , foodgrains production declined , but the extent of decline ranged between 2 to 18 per cent .
WPI food inflation was above 9 per cent , except for 2002-03 when off-take jumped by 59.2 per cent .
Low rainfall can also have adverse consequences for rural demand , overall growth and , fiscal and trade balance .
Agro imports constituted only 2.6 per cent of total imports in 2013-14 , but an additional impact can come from lower agro exports that constituted 13.6 per cent of India ' s total exports .
The marked improvement in monsoon since mid-July 2014 has reduced the likelinood of 2014-15 being a drought year but the final outcome would depend on the spatial distribution of rainfall in the rest of the season .
Thus , any losses in hydro-power are expected to be more than fully compensated by increased thermal and nuclear power and electricity production could register reasonably good growth .
The Asian Carry Trade Index measures the cumulative total return of a buy-and-hold carry trade position that is long four Asian currencies ( Indian rupee , Indonesian rupiah , Philippine peso and Thai baht ) that are fully funded with short positions in the US dollar .
It is assumed that the investment is in three-month money market securities , with each of the four Asian currencies assigned an equal weight in the currency basket .
The recent surge in global equity markets has come amidst low global growth and inflation and slower earnings growth particularly in the US , suggesting that equity markets are pricing assets with a very low risk premium .
With economic growth in the US and the UK expected to improve in the near future , there is a risk that central banks may start increasing policy interest rates earlier than what was previously assessed .
Irrespective of whether this happens or not , markets may start pricing rate hikes , which in turn may lead to increased uncertainty and higher volatility .
Further , an increase in interest rates in the US may trigger a reversal in carry trade flows to EMDEs leading to higher volatility in the forex , equity and bond markets .
During 2013-14 , the Indian financial markets were marked by periods of intense volatility , particularly during May-August 2013 ( accompanying taper related announcements ) .
As bond yields in the AEs , particularly the US , rose sharply , the attractiveness of their fixed income securities vis-a-vis those of the EMDEs improved and triggered large-scale sell-offs in domestic financial markets by foreign institutional investors ( Flls ) , causing intense volatility .
Weak macroeconomic fundamentals added to the volatility in the Indian markets , but the impact was largely in line with that of other EDMEs .
Opening of forex swap windows combined with restrictions on gold imports restored confidence in the markets immediately .
In addition , exceptional liquidity measures to contain volatility and their quick withdrawal helped restore stable market conditions in a sustainable way by September 2013 .
Money markets tracked the liquidity conditions and policy rates adjustments during the year .
The marginal standing facility ( MSF ) rate became the effective policy rate after the Reserve Bank placed a cap on the amount provided under the repo window of the liquidity adjustment facility ( LAF ) as part of the tightening measures to manage exchange rate volatility during July-September 2013 .
The weighted average call and collateralised borrowing and lending obligation ( CBLO ) rates increased to 9.97 per cent and 9.90 per cent respectively in September 2013 from 7.76 per cent and 7.36 per cent respectively in July 2013 .
However , a calibrated unwinding of exceptional monetary measures during September-October 2013 coupled with easing liquidity conditions on the back of large capital inflows under the forex swap facilities contributed towards the softening of money market rates and led to the restoration of stable conditions in the market .
During 2014-15 so far , the money market has remained orderly with the rates moving within the corridor set by the reverse repo rate and the MSF rate .
The average fortnightly issuance of certificate of deposits ( CDs ) and commercial papers ( CPs ) decreased in 2013-14 .
The weighted average effective interest rate ( WAEIR ) of aggregate CD issuances increased to 9.74 per cent at end-March 2014 from 9.24 per cent at end- March 2013 .
The weighted average discount rate ( WADR ) of CPs increased to 9.92 per cent at end- March 2014 from 9.77 per cent at end-March 2013 .
However , reflecting easing short term liquidity conditions , both CD and CP rates decreased to 8.69 per cent in July 2014 .
G-sec yields softened in the early part of the year reflecting some moderation in domestic inflation and easing of global commodity prices .
The 10-year generic yield touched a low of 7.12 per cent on May 24 , 2013 compared with 7.99 per cent at end-March 2013 .
The 10-year generic yield peaked at 9.27 per cent on August 19 , 2013 .
However , yields softened thereafter on the back of open market operation ( OMO ) purchases in August 2013 and on gradual unwinding of exceptional measures to tighten liquidity .
Subsequently , relatively higher government borrowings and continued monetary tightening with a view to containing inflation capped the downward movement .
The 10-year generic yield closed the fiscal year higher at 8.84 per cent .
Yields have softened during 2014-15 so far reflecting easing of the US treasury yields , active buying by institutional investors , moderation in inflation , improvement in the fiscal situation and growing positive market expectations about government policy after the general elections .
The gains had , however , been negated to an extent in June 2014 due to growing geopolitical tension in the Gulf region .
The yield curve flattened at the longer end as compared to the previous year and the average volume generally varied inversely with the movement of the 10-year G-sec yield .
The issuance strategy during the past focused on building volumes under benchmark maturities with a view to improving secondary market liquidity .
The Reserve Bank has developed an interest rate derivative market for making the debt market more vibrant and liquid .
The re-launch of interest rate futures ( IRFs ) on acash settled basis in December 2013 will further augment secondary market activity .
The Rupee came under severe pressure after the signalling of tapering of quantitative easing by the US Fed in May 2013 , reaching an all-time low of 68.36 ( RBI reference rate ) against the US $ as on August 28 , 2013 ..
It moved in a range of ₹ 60.1 to ₹ 63.0 during Q4 of 2013-14 and appreciated further in Q1 of 2014-15 .
A cross-country comparison shows that the Rupee performed better than some other peer economies .
During 2013-14 , capital inflows through foreign institutions remained highly volatile .
FIl flows in the debt segment , however , continued to remain volatile .
Flows in the two segments share relatively few common co-determinants apart from past exchange rate movements .
Past depreciation of the Rupee and other emerging market flows explain equity flows while domestic monetary variables such as interest rates and term spreads , besides Rupee depreciation drive debt flows .
Past stock market returns were found to be the main drivers of sharp spikes in flows , especially reversals in equity markets .
Few variables explain surges , while negative stock returns , higher treasury bill yields and a more upward sloping term structure influence equity reversals .
Sharp retractions in flows , particularly debt flows , followed the US talk of tapering of quantitative easing .
The results suggest that the US monetary policy spillover is transmitted internationally and one channel is through the markets for sovereign debt .
Except for a brief spell in January 2014 , when the domestic equity market recorded correction amidst the US Fed ' s reduction of asset purchases and eruption of a political crisis in Ukraine , the markets continued their upward trend .
Among the sectoral indices , BSE capital goods , BSE auto , BSE IT , BSE healthcare and BSE teck outperformed the benchmark index during 2013-14 , while broader indices such as BSE 100 and BSE 500 under- performed .
Concerns over the asset quality of banks and corporate governance arising from ownership structures of public sector banks , amongst other things have contributed to the low performance of the BSE Bankex since end-March 2013 .
The global crisis highlighted the risks of contagion from bank balance sheets across countries and called for higher standards in regulation to check system-wide stability issues with particular attention to the banking industry .
Taking a cue from the crisis , regulatory capital has been beefed up across countries including in India .
Nonetheless , the dynamic global developments call for a more robust institutional structure for the banking industry .
Structure of the Banking Industry - A Global Perspective It is important to review the banking structure in India with a view to enabling it to cater to the needs of a growing and globalising economy as well as furthering financial inclusion .
The global financial crisis of 2008 prompted many economies to review their banking structures .
Recently , based on its own research , the World Bank ( 2013 ) espoused a balanced view on the debate on state involvement in financial sector in the aftermath of the crisis .
It argued that evidence suggests that the state needs to encourage contestability through healthy entry of well- capitalised institutions and timely exit of insolvent ones .
While the crisis may have fuelled criticisms of ' too much competition ' in the financial sector , leading to instability , research suggests that factors such as a poor regulatory environment and distorted risk taking incentives promote instability rather than competition itself .
Other empirical studies suggest that the banking structure in a country evolves in response to the quantum and types of demand for banking services .
These demands , in turn , depend on the country ' s economic , demographic and geographical features .
In this backdrop , it is important to consider India ' s banking structure with a cross-country comparison based on some banking indicators ( Table 1 ) .
These indicators capture size , inclusiveness , ownership pattern , concentration and soundness .
Concentration ratio refers to the share of top three banking institutions in total assets of the banking industry .
NIMs are also high in the face of low competition and come in the way of efficiency .
This underscores the need for increasing the number of banking institutions , especially in the private sector .
The discussion paper on ' Banking Structure in India - The Way Forward ' released by the Reserve Bank in August 2013 , advocated fresh bank licensing on a _ ' continuous authorisation ' basis rather than a ' stop and go ' licensing policy .
It also spelt out a reoriented tiered banking structure for India having a few large banks with domestic and international presence , several mid-sized niche banks , regionally focused urban cooperative and regional rural banks and a large number of small privately owned local banks .
The committee on Comprehensive Financial Services for Small Businesses and Low Income Households ( Chairman : Dr Nachiket Mor ) submitted its report in January 2014 and recommended a vertically differentiated banking structure in which banks specialise in one or more of 3 functions - payments , credit delivery and retail deposit taking .
The committee , thus , recommended the licensing of new categories of specialised banks including payments banks and wholesale banks .
HLAC ' s recommendation that the application of the Department of Posts be considered separately in consultation with the Government of India has also been accepted by the Reserve Bank .

2014-15 , the primary equity market may improve backed by an already buoyant secondary market .
Housing prices rose at a moderate pace .
However , the pace of growth slowed in 2013-14 with an average growth in the all-India index at 12.6 per cent reflecting a correction in trends on the back of subdued demand .
The twin deficit risks that loomed large during H1 of 2012-13 were brought under control by lowering the fiscal gap since H2 of 2012-13 .
Recognising the spillover of high fiscal deficit into larger CAD was an important motivation for the central government to continue the fiscal consolidation process in 2013-14 , even though this was also needed from the perspective of aggregate demand management and its inflationary implications .
Notable gains in containment of key deficit indicators in 2013-14 are apparent in the provisional accounts ( PA ) .
In terms of ratio of GDP , revenue deficit ( RD ) , gross fiscal deficit ( GFD ) and primary deficit ( PD ) were placed lower at 3.2 per cent , 4.5 per cent and 1.2 per cent , respectively
Fiscal consolidation in 2013-14 vis-a-vis budget estimates ( BE ) was mainly achieved through reduction in capital expenditure and plan revenue expenditure , necessitated by a significant shortfall in tax revenues and disinvestment proceeds .
Gross tax revenues suffered a shortfall of 7.9 per cent from the budgeted level in 2013-14 , primarily due to lower indirect tax collections which were affected by industrial slowdown , deceleration in services sector growth and lower imports .
Non-tax revenues exceeded the budgetary targets , aided in large part by ad hoc dividend receipts from various public sector enterprises .
Both capital expenditure and capital outlay , as per cent of GDP , were lower in 2013-14 ( PA ) than their budgeted levels .
Note : Total expenditure , capital expenditure and non-debt capital receipts have been adjusted for pre-payment to National Small Savings Fund in 2004-05 and transactions relating to transfer of Reserve Bank ' s stake in State Bank of India ( SBI ) to the Government in 2007-08 .
Cutback in capital expenditure has potential adverse implications for growth prospects in the medium term .
Curtailment of expenditures through unpaid subsidies also helped to meet the deficit targets in 2013-14 .
This practice shifts the expenditure burden to subsequent years leading to fiscal imbalances over time .
There is , therefore , a need for improving fiscal accounting and transparency .
Further fiscal consolidation needed over the medium-term based on both expenditure cutting .
Scope exists for expenditure reorientation by curtailing subsidies and increasing public investment .
Subsidies accounted for nearly 23 per cent of the total non-plan spending during 2013-14 .
Notwithstanding some progress over the last 2 years in bringing subsidy expenditure under control , further expenditure reduction can be achieved through better targeting of subsidies , more frequent price revisions in domestic LPG and controlled fertilisers and by considerably limiting interest subventions .
There has hardly been any improvement in the gross tax revenue-GDP ratio of the central government , notwithstanding the gradual withdrawal of fiscal stimulus .
Indicates capital outlay and expenditure on education , health and rural development .
It is , therefore , imperative to improve the gross tax-GDP ratio through tax reforms , widening of the tax base Table II.10 : Gross Tax Revenue Raised by Components 2004-08 2007-08 2008-10 2010-14 2013-14 and better tax administration , to make further progress in fiscal consolidation .
Union Budget 2014-15 relies on buoyant tax revenues and higher disinvestment to reduce the fiscal gap .
With the expected growth of 19.8 per cent in overall tax revenues ' , the gross tax revenue-GDP ratio is budgeted to improve by 0.6 percentage points to 10.6 per cent during 2014-15 .
Non-debt capital receipts are budgeted to increase by 84.6 per cent in 2014-15 mainly due to a sharp growth in disinvestment proceeds .
Non-plan expenditure to moderate in 2014-15 through containment of subsidies ; capital expenditure budgeted to increase 11.5.8 Total expenditure is budgeted to increase by 14.8 per cent in 2014-15 .
Non-plan expenditure- GDP ratio is budgeted to decline by 0.3 percentage points to 9.5 per cent in 2014-15 , mainly by containing subsidies .
Among the other major non- plan expenditure items , while growth rates in interest payments and grants to states are envisaged to decelerate sharply in 2014-15 , growth in defence expenditure is budgeted to show a moderate increase .
Although plan expenditure is budgeted to increase at a significantly faster pace than non-plan expenditure , it will still remain less than one-third of the total expenditure .
The actual plan expenditures in 2012-13 and 2013-14 were lower than their budgeted levels by 20.6 per cent and 18.4 per cent , respectively .
States performed better in the second phase of 1.5.10 States resumed their fiscal consolidation in 2010-11 consequent to the amendments in their FRBM Acts in line with the targets set by the Thirteenth Finance Commission ( FC-XIlIl ) .
Fiscal consolidation during 2010-13 was largely revenue-led , with significant increases in both own tax revenue as well as current transfers from the Centre , the latter reflecting the enhancements recommended by FC-XIlIl .
The aggregate expenditure-GDP ratio was higher than that in the earlier high growth period of 2004-08 mainly on account of a sharp increase in development expenditure , particularly social sector expenditure .
Revenue surplus during the year was negligible as against a surplus of 0.2 per cent of GDP in 2012-13 .
The capital outlay-GDP ratio during 2013-14 ( RE ) increased by 0.4 percentage points over that in the previous year .
The BE for 2014-15 indicates a decline in the GFD-GDP ratio by 0.1 percentage point over 2013-14 ( RE ) mainly due to an increase in revenue receipts through higher current transfers from the Centre .
The combined gross fiscal deficit of the Centre and the states is placed higher at 7.0 per cent of GDP in 2013-14 ( RE ) as compared to 6.8 per cent in 2012-13 .
The decline in the fiscal deficit of the central government by 0.2 percentage points during 2013-14 ( RE ) was more than off-set by the sharp increase in the fiscal deficit of states by 0.5 percentage points .
In 2014-15 ( BE ) , the combined fiscal position is , however , budgeted to improve , reflecting the process of fiscal consolidation , both at the Centre as well as state levels .
The combined fiscal deficit in 2014-15 ( BE ) is placed lower at 6.4 per cent of GDP ( Appendix Table 6 ) .
Adherence to this target will be important as high fiscal deficit financed through debt issuances and the resultant public debt accumulation have an adverse impact on the economy , both in the short-run as well as the long-run .
India ' s external sector underwent a major adjustment in 2013-14 .
After widening to a historical annual high of 4.7 per cent of GDP during 2012-13 , the current account deficit ( CAD ) narrowed sharply in 2013-14 aided by a lower trade deficit .
A modest recovery in exports and a sharp fall in imports , particularly gold imports , helped in improving India ' s trade balance .
Following a lower trade deficit accompanied by robust growth in services export and stable flows of remittances , CAD declined to 1.7 per cent of GDP in 2013-14 .
Various proactive policy measures undertaken by policy authorities helped in mitigating external sector vulnerabilities and containing CAD within sustainable limits .
Reflecting the lagged impact of rupee depreciation and modest recovery in some trade partner economies , India ' s exports started improving in July 2013 .
However , the uptrend in exports was halted in February-March 2014 before it resumed in Q1 of 2014-15 .
Exports mainly benefitted from greater demand from Saudi Arabia , Iran , China , the US , EU countries and Japan .
Although export demand in a majority of the sectors witnessed an upturn , exports in the gems and jewellery sector declined both due to a fall in international prices of gold and silver and lower demand in select economies such as UAE .
In fact , the robust trend in demand for gems and jewellery from major destinations , viz . , the US , Hong Kong and Belgium was nullified by a sharp decline in exports to UAE .
Similarly , broadly reflecting a fall in gross refinery margins in the first three quarters of 2013-14 , India ' s exports of petroleum products to Singapore , UAE and the Netherlands moderated significantly .
Imports moderated significantly in 2013-14 reflecting the impact of the domestic economic slowdown , policy measures and fall in international prices of key import commodities .
For instance , various policy measures and fall in international prices stemmed the import of gold in 2013-14 .
With a significant fall in natural gas prices in 2013 , the international prices of fertilisers also eased , which limited the growth of India ' s fertiliser import bill .
India ' s lower demand for imports of iron and steel items was attributed to various factors such as depreciation of the rupee and improved domestic supply .
The slowdown in domestic economic activity and the delay in the implementation of various infrastructure projects probably reduced the demand for capital goods imports .
The recent upturn in exports and resumption of FIl flows augur well for India ' s overall balance of payments in 2014-15 .
As per provisional estimate for Q1 of 2014-15 , India ' s net export of services stayed almost stable at the level of Q1 of 2013-14 .
However , going forward , certain upside risks to CAD , that had fallen significantly in 2013-14 , cannot be ruled out .
Potential risks to India ' s balance of payments could emanate from both domestic and global factors .
First , as economic slack diminishes with recovery in the domestic economy , the upturn in the investment cycle will require higher non-oil non-gold imports , which already seem to be underway since May 2014 .
Second , speedy easing of norms for gold imports could lead to a widening of CAD in 2014-15 .
Third , even though international crude oil prices were earlier projected to stay low with gradual easing of the supply side , the re-emergence of geopolitical risks , particularly in Iraq and Russia ' s on-going tensions with Ukraine , may keep oil prices relatively firm and thus have implications for India ' s oil import bill .
This may pose upward risks to India ' s CAD .
Fourth , notwithstanding a modest recovery in exports on the back of stronger global demand and adjustment of the rupee exchange rate in 2013- 14 , downside risks continue due to uncertainty about the global growth outlook .
Lastly , some sector specific issues , particularly relating to drugs and pharmaceuticals , iron ore and coal need redressal to ensure a better trade balance .
Quantitative easing ( QE ) by advanced countries in recent years boosted foreign portfolio inflows significantly in India mainly reflecting higher growth and interest rate differentials .
After the US Fed ' s indication on QE tapering in May 2013 , net FIl flows retreated largely from the debt segment during June to November 2013 .
However , since the actual tapering of QE announced in December 2013 , FIl flows have remained broadly intact .
This essentially reflects considerable improvement in India ' s external sector with CAD falling below a sustainable level , a build-up of forex reserves owing to special swap schemes offered by the Reserve Bank ( during September-November 2013 ) and stability in the rupee exchange rate .
Further , growing prospects of a better policy environment with a stable central government in place may also have boosted the confidence of foreign investors .
However , going forward , FIl flows may remain prone to volatility with expected tightening of monetary policy in the U.S. , if domestic fundamentals do not improve and / or external sector risks re-emerge .
BRICS-CRA to help in managing short-term BoP China and South Africa signed an international treaty establishing the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement ( CRA ) , in Fortaleza , Brazil .
The initiative to implement the CRA was officially launched in June 2012 by the BRICS leaders at the sidelines of the G-20 Summit that took place in Los Cabos , Mexico .
The CRA complements and reinforces the global financial safety net , which comprises the IMF , regional financial arrangements and bilateral swap agreements between central banks , in addition to the countries ' own international reserves .
The initial total committed resources under the CRA will be US $ 100 billion .
The CRA will become effective only after fulfilling all the legal requirements for its entry into force .
India ' s external debt as at end March 2014 increased by US $ 31.2 billion over the year , mainly led by the special swap scheme introduced by the Reserve Bank for commercial banks to mobilise FCNR ( B ) and overseas borrowings .
The borrowings under the Swap Scheme in combination with a decline in CAD and revival in equity flows helped in building up foreign exchange reserves .
In line with greater recourse to debt creating flows , India ' s external debt and net external liabilities have risen in recent years .
However , since the incremental external debt during 2013-14 was mainly long-term in nature , it does not pose an immediate concern for India ' s external vulnerability .
Moreover , with increase in foreign exchange reserves in H2 of 2013-14 , most external sector vulnerability indicators have improved .
Following indications of QE tapering by the US Fed coinciding with growing concerns about high CAD , the rupee depreciated sharply during June to August 2013 .
In order to ensure better comparability of India ' s external competitiveness vis-a-vis its trading partners , the Reserve Bank released the CPI based real effective exchange rate ( REER ) in April 2014 .
In literature , there are a number of alternative measures of real exchange rates .
For computation of relative prices , indices based on consumer prices , producer prices , GDP deflator and unit labour costs are often used .
Each of these measures of relative prices has its own pros and cons .
Till recently , in the absence of a representative consumer price index ( CPI ) for India , the Reserve Bank was providing the REER index ( 6 and 36 currencies ) using the wholesale price index ( WPI ) and consumer price indices ( CPI ) for partner countries .
With greater focus on CPI inflation as the primary objective of domestic monetary policy , it is pertinent to have an alternative index of REER based on CPI .
The methodology used to construct the CPI based REER index ( both trade and export weights ) is discussed in RBI .
In line with the fall in the nominal value of the rupee , CPI based REER has also shown depreciation since 2011-12 .
However , given that the CPI based inflation differential with trade partner countries continues to be high , the REER of rupee is still above the base year level .
Further , the REER based on the 6 currency basket is higher than that based on the 36 currency basket .
Operations of one overseas principal engaged in the cross-border in-bound remittance service under money transfer service scheme ( MTSS ) ceased completely due to non-compliance of guidelines .
NPCI which operates the 24x7 Immediate Payment Service ( IMPS ) was accorded permission to introduce multiple settlement sessions .
In-principle approval was also given for setting up cardless cash withdrawal systems .
Over the years , the Reserve Bank first automated all clearing houses for settlement purposes and then leveraged the core banking solution ( CBS ) of banks for enabling processing of outstation cheques locally under speed clearing .
Later , CTS and grid-based CTS were introduced for building further efficiency in cheque clearing .
However , even after years , non-CTS 2010 standard cheques continued to be presented at CTS grids posing risks .
Banks were advised against the continued use of post-dated cheques in locations where the ECS facility was available .
As a customer service measure , banks were advised that cheque return charges should be levied only in cases where the customer is at fault and responsible for such returns , and not otherwise .
An arrangement of uniform holidays was put in place at the 3 grid-CTS locations for streamlining the procedures and ensuring faster cheque realisations across different states covered by the grid .
The NEFT system was enhanced for handling larger volumes and efficiency .
To improve customer service , banks were advised to adhere to the NEFT procedural guidelines concerning charges to customers , adherence to return discipline , facilitation of remittance for walk-in customers and suo moto payment of compensation for delayed credit or return .
Banks were advised to facilitate quicker lodging of complaints relating to ATM transactions and proactively registering mobile numbers / e-mail IDs of customers for sending alerts .
As a fraud control measure , banks were also advised to enable time-out sessions for all screens / stages of ATM transactions keeping in view the time required for such functions in the normal course .
The facility of e-KYC for opening accounts , available to banks , was also extended to non-bank entities authorised to issue PPls .
PPI guidelines , first issued in April 2009 were amended and consolidated in March 2014 .
To ensure safety and security of card payments , the Reserve Bank has mandated the migration to Europay , MasterCard and Visa ( EMV ) chip and personal identification number ( PIN ) for all international cards as also the need for a PIN for all debit card transactions at point of sale ( POS ) terminals .
While these requirements were to be complied by card issuing banks , similar requirements were placed on the banks which have installed card acceptance infrastructure for compliance to payment card industry data security standards ( PCI-DSS ) , terminal line encryption ( TLE ) and unique key per terminal ( UKPT ) / derived unique key per terminal ( DUKPT ) security .
Over a period of time , both card-not-present and card- present transactions have been strengthened through the use of the additional factor of authentication ( AFA ) .
The Reserve Bank issued a policy document on ' Regulation and Supervision of Financial Market Infrastructure ' ( FMI ) describing in detail the criteria for designating a FMI , its oversight and other related aspects .
CCIL has been advised to adopt the principles for financial market infrastructures ( PFMls ) issued jointly by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems ( CPSS ) and the International Organisation of Securities Commission ( IOSCO ) .
CCIL was declared a qualified central counterparty ( QCCP ) in the Indian jurisdiction on January 1 , 2014 .
During the year , CCIL has been granted several permissions / approvals : i ) doing away with physical exchange of confirmation for trades in the currency options , ii ) commencement of interest rate swaps ( IRS ) guaranteed settlement , iii ) in- principle approval for introduction of the payment vs payment ( PvP ) model in USD / INR settlement , and iv ) portfolio compression in USD-INR forex forward trades for members .
The committee submitted its report in January 2014 .
The committee identified the challenges faced by banks in providing mobile banking services to customers , including customer enrolment , technical issues and SMS / unstructured supplement service data ( USSD ) / application-based mobile banking .
PFMI suggests that ' FMls may use the assessment methodology to periodically conduct , full or partial , self-assessments of observance of the principles ' .
By trade compression , members off-set between the trades , which causes significant reduction in their outstanding trades and associated risks .
Members who desire to participate in the portfolio compression exercise have to indicate to the service provider their willingness and acceptance of the defined parameters .
The participants generally specify a threshold limit for mark-to-market ( MTM ) loss / gain caused due to the early termination of trades and the trades eligible for early termination based on these tolerances .
This involves execution of a mathematical algorithm to arrive at the optimum solution .
Generally , the live cycle is preceded by a mandatory trial run and the entire exercise is spread over 4 to 5 business days .
Portfolio compression is recognised globally as an important risk mitigating tool .
Periodic portfolio compression will eliminate the capital charge for risk weighted assets appearing on the balance sheets of banks / financial institutions .
CCIL , based on the approval of the Reserve Bank has been providing trade compression for interest rate swaps ( IRS ) only .
CCIL has now been accorded approval for carrying out portfolio compression in USD-INR forex forward trades for members of the segment .
CCIL will remain responsible for settlement of all these trades whether through portfolio compression or at the time of settlement of those trades on maturity .
The oversight framework is based on three parameters : monitoring , assessment and inducing change .
It is managed through self-assessment by the authorised entity , evaluation of the self- assessment and on-site inspection by the supervisors , complemented by off-site monitoring and market intelligence .
CPSS promotes the safety and efficiency of payments , clearing , settlement and related arrangements , thereby supporting financial stability and the wider economy .
It serves as a forum for central bank cooperation in related oversight , policy and operational matters including the provision of central bank services .
India continues to be a member of this important forum .
CPSS and IOSCO members are required to strive to adopt PFMls in their respective jurisdictions .
The term FMI generally refers to systemically important payment systems , central securities depositories ( CSDs ) , securities settlement systems ( SSSs ) , central counterparties ( CCPs ) and trade repositories ( TRs ) that facilitate the clearing , settlement and recording of financial transactions .
As a member of the Financial Stability Board ( FSB ) and of CPSS , the Reserve Bank is committed to the adoption and implementation of the ' Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures ' ( PFMIs ) .
The policy on supervision and regulation of FMIs regulated by RBI describes in detail the criteria for designating a FMI , applicability of PFMIs to FMls , oversight of FMls and other related aspects .
Hitherto the oversight was based on international standards such as Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems ( CPSIPS ) , Recommendations for Securities Settlement Systems ( RSSS ) and Recommendations for Central Counter Parties ( RCCP ) .
The FMls regulated by RBI are RTGS , SSS , CCIL and Negotiated Dealing System-Order Matching ( NDS-OM ) .
RTGS and SSS for government securities are owned and operated by the Reserve Bank .
The assessment of FMls , including those operated by the Reserve Bank , will be against the PFMls as per the document ' PFMIs-Assessment Methodology ' published by CPSS- IOSCO in December 2012 .
The oversight of FMls is carried out through a combination of off-site supervisions which include self-assessment , call for information , system of alerts , external and / or internal audits of control measures and prior approval of changes , on-site inspection and other measures which include periodic meetings with the boards and the senior managements of FMls to discuss developments , oversight concerns and expectations .
The purpose is to identify gaps between implementation measures and the principles , keeping in mind the materiality of the impact of the gaps .
In the Level-1 assessment report , India waas rated as ' 1 ' in adopting PFMI principles and ' 4 ' in adherence to the responsibilities of FMls in the survey results published in August 2013 .
Consequently , steps were taken by the Reserve Bank as also by the Securities and Exchange Board of India on making it public on adoption and applicability of PFMIs to the FMIs .
The second round of the survey was published in May 2014 wherein India has been rated ' 4 ' for both adherence to principles as also responsibilities .
The Reserve Bank is a member of the Regulatory Oversight Committee ( ROC ) as also its executive committee .
CCIL has been accorded approval to act as a LOU for issuing globally compatible LEls in India .
As a LOU , CCIL will be issuing unique identifier codes to all eligible and desirous legal entities participating in the financial market .
Further , SAARC formed a technical committee and came out with a concept paper on the harmonisation of payment systems in the region , covering two areas for harmonised payments : i ) card payments : inter-connectivity of main switches of ATMs of a country to route cross- border transactions ; and ii ) connecting e-payment gateways to enable integration of POS gateways between regional countries for acceptance of payment cards .
To ensure continuity and sustenance of ADF implementation , banks have been advised to set up internal returns governance groups to constantly monitor progress .
Globally , it is for the first time that the ISO 20022 message formats are being used for transmitting RTGS messages .
The new RTGS system provides 3 access options to participants : thick-client , web- API ( through INFINET or any other approved network ) and the payment originator module .
Participants have the choice to decide on the mode of participation in the system based on the volume of transactions and the cost of setting up the infrastructure .
With implementation of the new RTGS system , the old RTGS system ceases to exist and the RTGS System Regulations 2013 have replaced the RTGS ( Membership ) Business Operating Guidelines , 2004 and RTGS ( Membership ) Regulations , 2004 .
The Reserve Bank constituted a group in September 2013 to prepare an approach paper for enabling PKI for payment system applications in India .
The group comprised representatives from banks , the IDRBT-Certifying Authority , the Controller of Certifying Authority and departments of the Reserve Bank .
The group also interacted with Indian Banking Association ( IBA ) .
It also suggested that banks provide the option to their customers for enabling PKI for their online banking transactions .
ITSC was constituted to advise the Reserve Bank on its overall IT strategy , infrastructure , applications and security and to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the IT vision document 2011-17 .
The revised information security policy and related sub-policies have been approved by ITSC .
The operational guidelines relevant to administer the policy were released in April 2014 .
A steering committee to implement EDMS with an objective of organising the documents in a systematic manner in electronic form has been formed .
An approach paper for time bound implementation of EDMS has been prepared .
The revamped EKP with advanced features including interactive functionalities to enhance knowledge sharing initiatives in the Reserve Bank was inaugurated in November 2013 .
It provides a more focussed approach to knowledge sharing efforts in the Reserve Bank and has recorded increased level of visits by its staff .
The work related to VC upgradation , which would inter alia provide for executive VC rooms at select locations , classroom VC facility in training colleges , high definition technology for better quality , video streaming facility and video-on- demand facility has been rolled out at almost all identified locations within the Reserve Bank .
PSS aims to provide a mechanism to protect the information systems in the Reserve Bank from all threats / attacks from the external cyber world .
The solution includes routers , switches , firewalls , intrusion detection and prevention systems .
The project was implemented in two separate phases .
An advanced iSOC system to proactively detect security related incidents which have an impact on the Reserve Bank , other banks and the financial sector and manage and coordinate responses to such incidents is being implemented in the Reserve Bank .
An expression of interest ( Eol ) for supplying , installing , configuring , maintaining and operating iSOC has been issued .
The project is expected to be completed by December 2015 .
The Reserve Bank ' s corporate MMS was reinforced with an advanced archival solution to provide better access , storage and retrieval of mails to the users .
With archival facility , it will be possible to retrieve any mail from MMS .
The solution will also eliminate the need for regular increase in mail box size for users at frequent intervals .
Archival will also facilitate retention of mails to fulfil legal / statutory requirements .
The process to upgrade MMS has also been initiated and is expected to be completed by March 2015 .
The Reserve Bank ' s IT vision 2011-17 document emphasised the importance of both quality and timeliness of data for its processing into useful information for MIS and decision making purposes .
To achieve this , uniform data reporting standards are of vital importance .
A committee has been constituted for data standardisation which inter alia will bring about synergy and uniformity in the areas of data reporting .
Apart from maintaining high governance standards , focus was also placed on capacity building , further improving communication and transparency and fine-tuning the organisational framework .
The Bank continued to encourage research and knowledge sharing through publications , conferences , seminars and outreach programmes .
To ensure business continuity and effectively managing the other risks faced by it , the Reserve Bank has undertaken several initiatives toward enterprise-wide risk management .
These are expected to lower operational risks and strengthen the central bank ' s ability to meet various contingencies , should they arise , thus providing services in the nature of public goods .
The Reserve Bank continued to strengthen its human resources by recruiting new staff as well as through imparting training to existing staff members .
The Reserve Bank ' s communication policy focussed on transparency , dissemination of knowledge to a wider public and creating awareness about the financial risks faced by them in their day- to-day lives .
There was increased recourse to use of technology in attaining the intended objectives of the communication policy .
Another major focus of the initiatives for the organisational framework was on operational risk management and ensuring business continuity through the enterprise-wide risk management ( ERM ) framework .
Considerable progress was made during 2013-14 towards making the ERM framework fully functional .
The Reserve Bank of India being the central bank of the country is driven by the principles of public interest , transparency and public accountability and considerations of equity and fairness as well as to become responsive to the needs of the common person and to move towards diversity and inclusiveness .
Accordingly , in the Reserve Bank the governance structure is represented by the Central Board of Directors as the apex body , which aims to ensure that the Reserve Bank ' s general policy , strategy , administration and business are attuned to the role assigned to it and meet the challenges before the country ' s economy .
The Governor presides over the meetings of the Central Board and he is assisted by four Deputy Governors and nine Executive Directors in managing the affairs of the Reserve Bank .
Besides , the Bank has four Local Boards constituted by the Government for the Northern , Southern , Eastern and Western areas of the country .
The Government of India appoints / nominates the Directors to the Central Board and Members to the four Local Boards .
At present the Central Board has three Committees ( Committee of the Central Board , Board for Financial Supervision and Board for Regulation and Supervision of Payment and Settlement Systems ) and four sub- committees ( Audit and Risk Monitoring Sub- Committee , Human Resource Management Sub- Committee , Building Sub-Committee and Information Technology Sub-Committee ) of the Central Board .
With a view to improving governance , efforts have been made to make the meetings of the Board and its Committees streamlined , focused and effective .
The number of meetings of the Central Board has been reduced to the statutory minimum and technology is being leveraged to save resources and time .
The Central Board held six meetings during 2013-14 ( July 2013-June 2014 ) .
Of these , four were held at the traditional centres ( Chennai , Mumbai , Kolkata and New Delhi ) and two at non-traditional centres ( Raipur , Shimla ) .
Forty six weekly meetings of the Committee of the Central Board ( CCB ) were held during the year ( July 2013 to June 2014 ) in Mumbai .
The Committee attended to the current business of the Reserve Bank , including approval of the Bank ' s weekly accounts pertaining to the Issue and the Banking Departments .
On the sidelines of the Central Board ' s meetings held at various places , the Governor interacted with the Chief Ministers and senior officials of state governments , commercial banks and financial institutions in the respective states .
In general , discussions with these officials covered issues like extension of banking services in unbanked / under-banked areas , use of information technology ( IT ) enabled banking services / measures to promote financial inclusion , enhancing credit flow , electronic benefit transfer ( EBT ) schemes , developing self-help groups ( SHGs ) , improving the credit-deposit ratio and currency management issues .
Shri Azim Premji ceased to be Director of the Central Board with effect from September 20 , 2013 .
ShriK.Venkatesan , Shri D. V. Salgaocar and Shri J. B. Patel ceased to be Members of Western Area Local Board with effect from January 27 , 2014 and Dr Ram Nath ceased to be Member of the Northern Area Local Board with effect from Section 9 ( 3 ) of RBI Act , 1934 .
Shri R. Gandhi was appointed as Deputy Governor of the Bank with effect from April 3 , 2014 ; and he assumed office on the same day .
He took charge of the office of Deputy Governor on the same day .
Shri Anand Sinha laid down office as Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank on January 20 , 2014 on expiry of his term .
Dr. K. C. Chakrabarty demitted office of the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank on April 25 , 2014 .
Professor M.V. Rajeev Gowda ceased to be a member of the Southern Area Local Board of the Bank and also a Director of the Central Board consequent upon his election to the Rajya Sabha provisions of Section 11 ( 5 ) of the RBI Act , 1934 .
Shri S. Karuppasamy , Executive Director , retired from service as at the close of business on January 31 , 2014 .
The delegations interacted with the top management on a wide spectrum of issues including reviews of the global economic scenario , framework for sustainable and balanced global growth , mutual trade and bilateral relations as well as the Bank ' s policy initiatives in different areas of its functioning .
A wide range of information in the form of notifications , press releases , data and speeches is disseminated through the Bank ' s website .
In its effort to reach out to the maximum number of stakeholders , the Reserve Bank also uses available technology .
Monetary policy communication , including the Governor ' s live statement and press conference , for instance , are now being disseminated through mobile phones along with live streaming of the announcements on monetary policy through television channels and webcasting .
Feedback being an important part of the Reserve Bank ' s communication activity , 3 draft reports and 5 draft guidelines on regulatory as well as market related issues were released on the website for public comments .
Awareness campaigns held during the year Non-Banking Finance Companies ( NBFC ) The Reserve Bank undertook an awareness campaign for NBFC depositors after some fraudulent deposit schemes came to light during the year .
The awareness programme involved publication of ' frequently asked questions ' on the entire gamut of issues relating to NBFCs and a series of advertisements beginning September 2 , 2013 .
As the next step , the Reserve Bank brought together on a public platform all the regulators of NBFCs in a town hall in Chandigarh to interact with customers of these companies .
The objective of this initiative was to sensitise the regulators and the public about issues relating to NBFCs .
The Reserve Bank also collaborated with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and Department of Consumer Affairs for joint campaigns .
Two rounds of advertisements were released in the same set of 217 newspapers published in 11 vernacular languages ( apart from English and Hindi ) .
To spread awareness about fictitious offers , the Reserve Bank of India released two rounds of advertisements in English , Hindi and 11 regional language newspapers on an all-India basis ( the first round covered 608 newspapers on April 9 , 2013 and the second round covered 210 newspapers on June 19 , 2013 ) .
This was done jointly with the Department of Consumer Affairs , in the Ministry of Consumer Affairs under its ' Jago Grahak Jago ' series .
The Reserve Bank also issued notice warnings in May 2014 about the fake website in its name started by some unknown persons offering various banking facilities and asking members of the public to apply online for opening ' RBI savings accounts ' .
To widen the reach of the awareness campaign on fictitious offers , audio spots of 30-seconds each on the fictitious offers were broadcast on 59 All India Radio ( including Vividh Bharti Channels ) and 145 private FM radio stations of 22 private FM channels .
To create awareness about inflation indexed national savings securities-cumulative ( IINSS-C ) , the Reserve Bank released one introductory advertisement and 3 follow-up advertisements during December 21-31 , 2013 in 14 languages in 23 largest circulating newspapers and again in 46 newspapers in 13 languages including English and Hindi during March 2014 .
An awareness programme was carried on popular radio FM channels and in investors ' conferences .
Broadly , the Reserve Bank ' s communication on monetary policy was successful in sensitising financial market participants and in improving the acceptance of its monetary policy stance .
However , some gaps were identified in communication during the period of financial market stress in H1 of 2013- 14 while assessing its communication policies internally .
The Reserve Bank intends to follow-up its internal assessment with an institutionalised process of assessing its communication policies .
In order to enhance the reach of its publications , the Reserve Bank conducted 4 outreach seminars covering the 4 zones of the country during the year .
The seminars were attended by students from colleges , universities and senior faculty members .
The Department of Communication has been organising educational visits to the Reserve Bank since 2006 as part of its financial literacy initiatives .
Over the years the visits have been gaining popularity among colleges and management schools .
Between July 2013 and June 2014 , the Department conducted 40 such visits covering over 2,000 students .
The participation was mainly from schools , colleges , non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) , senior citizens groups , women ' s group and also students from foreign universities .
Research publications of the Reserve Bank ' s staff viz . , the Reserve Bank Occasional Papers and the web-based Reserve Bank of India Working Paper Series ( RBIWPS ) continued as major platforms for disseminating in-house technical and analytical research on a wide array of macroeconomic and policy issues .
In order to take the research initiatives forward , the Reserve Bank , in February 2014 , allowed its staff to publish jointly authored papers with external researchers in the RBIWPS and Reserve Bank Occasional Papers , which were earlier restricted to Reserve Bank staff members only .
In addition to in-house research , the Reserve Bank encourages and promotes external research activities in academic and research institutions through endowment scheme including establishing RBI professorial chairs in universities / research institutions , funding medium-term research projects / conferences / workshops / seminars / publication of journals / scholarship scheme for faculty members from academic institutions and organising development research group ( DRG ) studies ( collaborative ) .
So far , 40 DRG studies have been published and 4 papers under scholarship schemes for faculty members from academic institutions have been completed .
The Reserve Bank of India under the Programme Funding Scheme has initiated the ISI- RBI ( DSIM ) Research Collaboration , wherein Indian Statistical Institute ( ISI ) , Kolkata has agreed to work on four proposals for validation and improvement of various surveys undertaken by the Bank for a period of one year .
The research paper was released by the Bank in June 2014 .
The Reserve Bank imparts necessary knowledge and skill upgradation to develop its human resources ' technical and behavioural skills .
The 6 training establishments of the Bank , viz . , Reserve Bank Staff College ( RBSC ) , Chennai , College of Agricultural Banking ( CAB ) , Pune and four Zonal Training Centres at Mumbai , New Delhi , Kolkata and Chennai cater to its internal training requirements .
For supporting activities in the fields of research , training and consultancy for the banking and financial sector during 2013-14 , the Reserve Bank provided financial support of ₹ 220 million to the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research ( IGIDR ) , Mumbai ; ₹ 60.5 million to the Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning ( CAFRAL ) , Mumbai ; ¥ 15.9 million to the National Institute of Bank Management ( NIBM ) , Pune ; ₹ 5.10 million to the Indian Institute of Bank Management ( IIBM ) , Guwahati ; and ₹ 10 million for setting up the London School of Economics ( LSE ) India observatory and the IG Patel Chair .

The telecast of the zonal and national finals on Doordarshan ' s national channel also gave substantial publicity to the event and the Bank ' s efforts in putting it together .
Apart from skill enhancement of its existing staff , the Reserve Bank also undertook initiatives towards strengthening its organisational framework and acquiring new talent during the year .
The employee- management relationship remained healthy and peaceful during the year .
The Reserve Bank received 7,041 requests for information and 1,130 first appeals under the RTI Act during the year , all of which were attended to .
The Bank conducted 4 training programmes at its training centre for its staff on RTI Act .
Of the total staff strength , 20.1 per cent belonged to Scheduled Castes and 7.0 per cent belonged to Scheduled Tribes .
During 2013 ( January-December ) , the Reserve Bank ' s management and the representatives of the All India Reserve Bank Scheduled Castes / Scheduled Tribes and the Buddhist Federation met 4 times and discussed issues relating to the implementation of the reservation policy in the Reserve Bank .
The total strength of ex-servicemen in the Reserve Bank as of end-December 2013 stood at 923 .
The category-wise composition of the staff strength is given in Table X.5.

The Reserve Bank has undertaken a project to carry out business process re-engineering ( BPR ) of prevailing human resource ( HR ) systems and implementing a comprehensive human resource system for it .
A consultant has been engaged for the BPR exercise and also for providing end-to-end consultancy for implementing the project .
The consultant has submitted a BPR report and suggested various changes in the existing HR processes .
The Reserve Bank has formed an internal group to examine these suggestions .
It has also been decided to set up a centralised processing centre to facilitate the processing of all HR related operations .
A system integrator has been identified for the purpose .
The project is likely to be completed in 2014-15 in two phases ; first phase will cover implementation of payroll and benefit administration from a centralised location and second phase will cover recruitment , talent management and training and development modules .
Integrity has been one of the core strengths of the Reserve Bank .
Beginning November 2013 , the Bank adopted an ethics code , titled ' ethics @ work ' .
This code , applicable to all employees at all levels in the Bank , seeks to explicitly inform both the new entrants and the serving staff members about the ethical standards expected of them .
The Bank is , therefore , in the process of preparing a new comprehensive set of guidelines for dealing with such complaints .
These guidelines are proposed to be issued during 2014-15 .
The Reserve Bank kept up its efforts towards promoting the use of Hindi in its working during 2013-14 .
Apart from meeting the statutory requirements of the Rajbhasha Policy , all statutory and other publications were published in bi-lingual form .
The revised edition of the Banking English- Hindi Glossary was reprinted during the year in view of an increased demand for it .
The Bank organised a number of inter-bank and internal Hindi competitions as well as several Hindi functions during the year .

The Bank has started work on putting in place an integrated security system in the central office building in Mumbai .
The existing closed circuit television ( CCTV ) systems will be replaced by an internet protocol ( IP ) based CCTV system in a phased manner in all offices within the next 2 years .
In order to enhance the perimeter security in the Bank ' s central office premises , an access control card based turnstile system has been commissioned and a similar system will be installed in the other offices also .
To provide enhanced security in the cash handling areas in the Bank ' s premises , a shooting bolt interlocking system is being implemented in all the offices after its successful completion in the Mumbai regional office .
Installation of the radio frequency identification ( RFID ) system for vehicle entry in the Bank ' s premises has been taken up as a pilot project in the Bangalore office .
In order to conserve natural resources , to protect the environment and also to improve employee wellness and productivity , a green policy for the Bank has been formulated and has been placed before the Committee of the Central Board for approval .
The power plant has generated 14,000 units of electricity amounting to a reduction of about 11,000 kg of CO2 .
Subsequently , Chennai office has also commissioned a solar power plant of 10 KWp capacity .
Such projects are being taken up for other offices in a phased manner .
In order to save energy and mitigate fire risks in offices , energy efficient centralised uninterruptible power supply ( UPS ) systems for the entire office have been commissioned in all the offices of the Bank .

The procurement process for replacing lifts in the Bhopal office is in progress .
Work of installing an energy efficient central air-conditioning system at the Reserve Bank offices in Patna and Nagpur has been completed .
The Reserve Bank is exposed to a sizeable amount of risk in the course of performing its public policy functions .
In order to strengthen its internal risk management systems , the Reserve Bank rolled out the ERM framework in 2012 , which comprises of a ' risk governance structure " as well as a 3-tier ' risk management structure ' .
Further , ERM risk policies and methodologies are also being put in place to bring about uniformity in identifying and assessing risks across the Bank .
As a part of the bottom-up approach , preparing risk registers for business areas has started .
During the year , the Risk Monitoring Department introduced a Risk Assessment Methodology for Operational Risk to enable the various business areas to assess and rate operational risks on a uniform basis and also to enable the preparation of heat maps .
A Risk Glossary and a Risk Taxonomy were prepared to provide a common language for identifying and classifying risks across the Bank .
Also , guidelines and computerised formats have been issued by the Risk Monitoring Department for preparing risk registers and also for strengthening risk-related MIS .
An online incident reporting format has also been put in place for creating an institutional memory of incidents / near misses .
Concomitantly , efforts have been made to strengthen the risk culture in the Bank .
Towards this end , teams of risk officers have been appointed in all central office departments / regional offices with well defined roles and responsibilities .
In order to ensure that the development of the risk management framework is in line with international best practices , the Reserve Bank joined the International Operational Risk Working Group ( IORWG ) in 2014 .
IORWG is a group of 57 central banks that provides a platform for sharing best practices and approaches in risk management in central banks .
With regard to financial risks , on the balance sheet of the Bank a sound counterparty risk management regime is in place ; most exposures are backed by high quality collateral .
Market risk is managed by portfolio optimisation techniques .
In the case of the monetary / exchange rate policy operations , the Reserve Bank does not weigh the risks / costs of its policy actions while deciding upon the course of action , as balance sheet considerations remain subordinate to monetary and financial stability considerations .
The Reserve Bank , nevertheless , does maintain an overarching view of risks faced by it to ensure that it has the financial resilience to absorb these risks .
The Bank maintains contingency reserve for meeting various risks including those arising from monetary / exchange rate policy operations .
The risk management structure refers to the 3-tier structure comprising of the business area which is the first line of defence and is primarily responsible for managing its risks while the risk monitoring and the risk assurance ( audit / inspection ) functions represent the second and third lines of defence , respectively .
Given the importance of the business continuity management ( BCM ) function , a dedicated BCM framework has been approved to strengthen the Reserve Bank ' s existing business continuity processes and the Bank is in the process of putting this in place .
Apart from assessment of risks in operations , the ' value for money ' approach to audit built on the 3E principles of economy , efficiency and effectiveness has been adopted as a fundamental attribute of the RBIA methodology .
The Inspection Department carried out audit / inspection of 16 regional offices ( including branch offices ) , 9 Banking Ombudsman offices , 14 central office departments and one training establishment during the year .
All financial operations of the Bank are covered under the concurrent audit system .
The Bank ' s currency management functions and processes were evaluated end to end through a vertical audit process .
As a part of the regular RBIA , information system ( IS ) audits were also conducted at all the offices ( including 3 data centres ) during the year .
The Bank also carries out vulnerability assessment-penetration testing ( VA-PT ) of its information technology systems , website and databases as a part of the RBIA framework .
A compliance audit of VA-PT of the human resource management system and the public website of the College of Agricultural Banking was also carried out during the year .
Considering the revamped IS architecture with enhanced security features , a system of self-assessment certification of IT applications / systems used by regional offices / departments using internal resources has been introduced in five metro centres replacing the erstwhile continuous assurance audit arrangement .
In 2013-14 , the Bank continued to take initiatives to meet the challenges faced by a central bank operating in a continuously evolving financial and economic environment .
In this direction , it has taken internal initiatives to draw a blueprint for organisational restructuring to better serve the evolving financial sector which in turn can foster growth with stability in the country .
This will bring greater managerial synergies and also allow the staff to better develop their expertise in various key work-areas .
The Bank is also focussing on assessing its human resources in relation to newer challenges being faced by the central bank by bringing about changes in HR policies to improve motivational levels and to align organisational resources with the evolving work content and policy orientation for greater efficiency .
With a view to effectively managing operational and financial risks and ensuring business continuity , the Bank is in the process of identifying key risks in various areas which will become the focus of its internal risk management strategies .
The initiatives towards implementing the enterprise-wide risk management framework in this regard are in line with international best practices .
The Bank also plans to bring out a vision statement to provide a clear exposition of its core purposes and values or shared principles which may guide organisational decisions and employee actions .
Core purposes could include those related to macroeconomic and financial stability , while principles depicting organisational values could include public interest , integrity , independence of views , transparency and accountability , responsiveness , exploration and innovation , besides pursuit of excellence .
The Reserve Bank intends to further improve the financial sector through a series of initiatives that rest on five pillars .
Its work agenda includes working with the government to strengthen the monetary policy framework .
To strengthen the banking structure , the Reserve Bank will put in place a system for licensing differentiated banks and move towards on-tap licensing of universal banks .
Several complementary steps , like refining priority sector guidelines and KYC norms are also under consideration .
The Reserve Bank will continue its efforts to broaden and deepen financial markets through an array of initiatives .
Besides , ongoing efforts will reinforce the regulatory and supervisory regimes , with a view to reducing distress in financial and non-financial firms .
In mid-2013-14 , the Reserve Bank set itself amedium-term agenda of transforming the financial sector , to turn it into a stronger , deeper , more efficient and inclusive system .
This agenda was built on five pillars .
The approach encompasses : ( i ) strengthening the monetary policy framework ; ( ii ) increasing diversity and competition in banking industry while improving governance in existing banks ; ( iii ) broadening the choice of financial instruments , and deepening and enhancing liquidity in financial markets ; ( iv ) improving access to finance ; and ( v ) reinforcing the financial system ' s ability to cope with stress .
As explained in Chapter I , high and persistent inflation has become a key risk to the growth outlook and to overall macroeconomic stability .
The Reserve Bank has set out a disinflation path , with the goal of containing consumer price index CPI inflation to 8 per cent by January 2015 and 6 per cent by January 2016 .
The outlook segment of Chapter | spells out the Reserve Bank ' s approach to strengthening the monetary policy framework and addressing impediments to the transmission of monetary policy .
It intends to take this approach forward in coordination with the government , recognising the government ' s efforts to augment supply capacity , as well as the Reserve Bank ' s traditional focus on managing aggregate demand .
Both the supply and demand side approaches are necessary for lowering inflation .
As such , monetary , fiscal and structural policies have to play complementary roles in containing inflation .
The Finance Ministers 2014-15 budget speech indicated the government ' s commitment to putting in place a modern monetary policy framework in consultation with the Reserve Bank .
Implementation of the proposed new monetary policy framework could go a long way in building monetary policy credibility and anchoring inflation expectations .
The forecasting and analytical abilities of a central bank are essential to understand inflation and growth dynamics , as also transmission of monetary policy .
Recognising this , the Reserve Bank has an agenda to develop an array of models that can serve as a useful support for monetary and macroeconomic policy formulation and analysis .
Like many other central banks , the attempt will be to develop such models through dedicated technical teams over the medium-term .
A heterogeneous banking system can meet varied customer needs in a more efficient manner .
It can offer a wider range of customer services that can enhance consumer welfare as different banks can operate differently based on their reach , liquidity , capitalisation and market power considerations .
Overall , the banking system can become more competitive and efficient as it becomes more varied .
This was also reaffirmed in the Union Budget 2014-15 .
Differentiated banks serving niche interests are contemplated to meet credit and remittance needs of small businesses , the unorganised sector , low income households , farmers and migrant workers .
Accordingly , the Reserve Bank in mid-July 2014 issued separate draft guidelines for licensing of Small Banks and Payment Banks .
After obtaining comments and suggestions from the stakeholders , the final guidelines are expected to be issued later in the year .
The experience drawn from the global financial crisis suggests that the build-up of excessive on-balance sheet , as well as off-balance sheet leverage in the banking system was at the core of the financial fragilities those were witnessed .
In this context , based on recent recommendations by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ( BCBS ) , the Reserve Bank will issue revised guidelines on the leverage ratio .
In order to contain the maximum loss a bank could face in the event of a sudden failure of a counterparty or a group of connected counterparties and retain its solvency , the Reserve Bank has put in place single and group borrower exposure limits .
BCBS revised its standards on large exposures in April 2014 , under which the exposure limits for ' single ' and ' group of counterparties ' were kept at 25 per cent of Tier | capital .
Our current exposure limits to a group of borrowers is much higher at 40 per cent of capital funds ( plus 10 per cent for infrastructure finance ) .
It is proposed to review the exposure norms in 2014-15 , to gradually align them with the revised global standards .
The tightening of exposure norms will also help in risk mitigation during cyclical downturns as banks exposure under the framework will be more granular and diversified to a large number of unrelated counterparties rather than being concentrated to a handful of large and related counterparties .
While banks are unique in financial system as they provide checkable deposit facilities and have credit creation capacity , non-bank financial companies ( NBFCs ) occupy a vital position in the financial system by providing niche services at low intermediation costs .
The Reserve Bank is at present engaged in reviewing the extant regulatory framework for NBFCs , keeping in view the developments in the sector , the recommendations made by various committees and suggestions made by Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission ( FSLRC ) .
Certain changes are being envisaged with a view to appropriately aligning regulation of similar activities by different financial intermediaries .
Consequently , some of the areas being reviewed include prudential regulations with a view to strengthening core capital , asset classification and provisioning norms , acceptance of deposits , corporate governance , consumer protection and enhanced reporting , disclosures and transparency for the sector .
In addition , the Reserve Bank is engaged in taking suitable steps to strengthen the supervisory framework .
The issue of raising of debentures through private placements will be relooked at in view of the revised regulations on private placements under the Companies Act 2013 .
The Reserve Bank also proposes to carry forward the work of the G-20 and Financial Stability Board ( FSB ) on shadow banking so as to identify possible areas of interconnectedness and entities that can pose risks to the formal financial sector .
In the wake of recent revelations of unauthorised acceptance of deposits by some companies , the Reserve Bank is intensifying its publicity and customer awareness initiatives to educate the public on and the necessity of exercising appropriate diligence before depositing money with any entity .
The State Level Coordination Committees ( SLCCs ) are being strengthened to allow for greater sharing of information between financial sector regulators and state governments and for facilitating coordinated action against recalcitrant entities .
Further , steps are underway to strengthen the market intelligence function which is of particular significance for effective supervision of this sector .
It is proposed to strengthen SAF to identify problems and initiate corrective action at an early stage .
Efforts will be made to put in place a mechanism to facilitate mergers / takeovers of assets and liabilities of negative net worth banks without the acquiring bank having to bear the burden of the loss .
At present , conversion of a UCB into a commercial bank is not permitted .
The Reserve Bank plans to engage with the Government of India for enabling legal changes to help large and willing multi-state urban cooperative banks to convert themselves into commercial banks .
Over the next few years , the Reserve Bank will make efforts to further improve its tools for stress testing of banks by including a wider array of indicators .
The Reserve Bank has over the last three years developed considerable capacity and a well-established stress testing framework , but this could be refined further especially in a multi-factor setting .
The Reserve Bank has been disseminating its stress results through its Financial Stability Report ( FSR ) that is published twice a year - June and December .
The Reserve Bank also publishes its statutory Report on Trends and Progress of Banking in India .
Deeper , wider , more liquid and efficient financial markets provide support to growth .
To make this process more efficient and transparent , the Reserve Bank plans to undertake reforms in financial markets , set up an over the counter ( OTC ) derivatives trade repository and take several other steps in support of the debt management strategy .
The objective is to overcome the conflicts of interest in the benchmark setting process arising out of their current governance structure .
The proposed independent body will implement the recommendations of the Committee on Financial Benchmarks and will ensure compliance with the International Organisation of Securities Commission ( IOSCO ) Principles on Financial Benchmarks .
The benchmarks submission activities of the banks and primary dealers ( PDs ) , including their governance arrangements for submissions , will be brought under the Reserve Bank ' s on-site and off-site supervision system .
With a ₹ 6 trillion market-borrowing programme , sovereign debt markets assume a vital role in the conduct of fiscal policies and have spillover effects , including that on interest rates and the exchange rate .
The Reserve Bank plans to articulate a comprehensive Debt Management Strategy with sound international practice , extending maturities to cater to the requirements of diverse investors , undertaking consolidation of public debt and reducing rollover risk through active switch / buyback operations .
In this context , a review of the guidelines for short sale and repo / reverse repo in G-secs is planned with a view to introducing limited re-repo / re-hypothecation of " repoed " government securities .
Possible ways to revitalise market-making by PDs will also be examined .
Introduction of the swap execution facility with central counterparty ( CCP ) in the interest rate swap ( IRS ) market will be a focus area during 2014-15 .
Upgradation of the NDS order-matching ( NDS-OM ) platform would be initiated with the objective of having faster throughput , enhanced functionalities , rich user interface and internationally compatible message formats .
The feasibility of international settlements for Indian sovereign debt securities will also be examined .
Even though the current account deficit ( CAD ) has improved since Q2 of 2013-14 , the need for robust capital flows in a capital deficit economy like India assumes importance to bridge the saving- investment gap .
Against this backdrop , foreign exchange management will evolve keeping in view long-term objectives as well short-term developments in the external sector .
The specific areas that will engage the Reserve Bank ' s attention include : ( i ) simplifying the foreign investment regime to ensure that it is user- friendly to all stakeholders ; ( ii ) reviewing the scope of external commercial borrowings ; and ( iii ) reviewing the foreign exchange derivative market to enhance its width and depth .
With this in view , the proximate objective is to consolidate and rationalise extant regulations so as to provide a simple , comprehensive and transparent regime .
The Reserve Bank ' s action plan includes a review of the borrowing regime for the infrastructure sector .
A framework for multilateral agencies as well as Indian infrastructure financing companies to access the international market through rupee denominated bonds will also be explored .
The foreign exchange market needs more products to help participants manage their foreign exchange risk .
Non-residents , can also be granted greater access thereby taking the process of capital account liberalisation further .
Foreign portfolio investors ( FPIs ) have now been granted access to the domestic exchange traded derivative markets .
Further rationalisation of the procedure would be considered based on experience .
Over the medium term , extending access to the OTC market to international stakeholders could also be considered .
Besides , options market could be expanded over the coming years to allow market participants hedge more easily and cheaply .
Over the past several years , the Reserve Bank ' s efforts to improve access to finance for poor people and small enterprises have yielded positive results .
Yet , in view of the sheer enormity of the task , these efforts have to go much further .
Efforts will be made to use innovative products , technology , telecom infrastructure and the biometric data base of the government to onboard customers and improve accessibility to bridge the gap between performance and potential .
The ' Know Your Customer ' ( KYC ) guidelines will be re-examined with a view to making banking more friendly , while at the same time ensuring that it does not weaken anti-money laundering requirements .
Priority sector guidelines have not kept pace with changing economic priorities and may lead to less efficient use of resources .
During the course of the year , priority sector guidelines will be reviewed .
In order to continue with the process of ensuring further penetration of banking services to the financially excluded people , banks were advised in January 2013 to draw up fresh 3-year financial inclusion plans ( FIPs ) for the period 2013-16 .
The focus under the new plan was to ensure increase in the volume of transactions , especially in Business Correspondents-Information and Communication Technology ( BC-ICT ) accounts , by increasing the flow of credit to small value customers , as greater use of technology is key to lowering transaction costs and making financial inclusion a viable proposition .
Financial inclusion efforts will be supported by initiatives in the area of payment systems .
Efforts will be made to provide a fillip to mobile banking in the country so as to leverage the potential of the high mobile density that exists in the country .
Necessary groundwork will be undertaken to put in place standards for customer on-boarding , security of transactions and redressal of customer grievances , besides engaging with stakeholders to explore the feasibility of having a standardised application for mobile banking across banks .
The empowered committees on micro , small and medium enterprises ( MSMEs ) set up at the Reserve Bank ' s regional offices will be asked to more closely monitor and review the progress of restructuring / rehabilitation of sick MSE units to help in early detection of sickness in MSE units and their timely revival .
Further , in order to provide quick and efficient financing options for the MSME segment , itis proposed to set up an electronic Trade Receivables Discounting System ( TReDS ) .
This system will bring together the MSMEs , their corporate buyers as well as financiers and reduce the constraints faced by the MSME segment in liquidity management .
The actionable agenda for 2014-15 for payment and settlement systems will include putting in place the guidelines and operational parameters for a pan-India bill payment system which will facilitate anytime , anywhere system of making bill payments .
Also , the consolidation of payment systems which offer similar services or cater to the needs of same market segments ( for instance , electronic clearing service ( ECS ) and National Automated Clearing House ( NACH ) will be taken up .
Regulation of any industry is guided by considerations of lowering risks , encouraging competition and adoption of fair practices to protect the interest of producers as well as consumers .
The vulnerability of consumers , particularly retail consumers of services provided by financial intermediaries , including banks , is well recognised .
Therefore , there is a pressing need for the creation of a unified consumer protection framework which will apply to all segments of the financial system .
During 2014-15 , the Reserve Bank proposes to frame comprehensive consumer protection regulations based on domestic experience and global best practices .
A Charter of Customer Rights in collaboration with various stakeholders in the banking sector will be formulated .
The Reserve Bank is planning several initiatives with a view to improving currency management and providing better services for the common man .
The Reserve Bank is also looking at other alternatives for improving the life of banknotes .
In view of the continuous increase in the number of notes in circulation , the Reserve Bank will harness technological advancements in the areas of storage , transport and distribution as also to set up a fully automated cash processing centre as a pilot project .
It also proposes to introduce new series banknotes in order to take advantages of the latest innovations in the currency note printing technology and to stay ahead of counterfeiters , as also redesign coins to make them user friendly and long lasting .
The Reserve Bank is also bringing about improvements in packing currency notes so as to make handling more labour friendly .
The Reserve Bank in 2013-14 has taken several initiatives in this regard and plans to carry the agenda forward by strengthening the corporate debt restructuring mechanism , credit information and the resolution regime .
It assessed the need of a resolution regime for all financial institutions and financial market infrastructure ( FMI ) other than those owned and operated by the Reserve Bank of India , with an eye on overall financial stability .
In coordination with FSDC , the Reserve Bank intends to take the process forward by seeking necessary legal and institutional changes and by creating of a resolution fund .
A successful policy agenda and its implementation , broadly encompassing the five pillars mentioned earlier , needs research support .
Accordingly , a research agenda has been drawn in the Reserve Bank .
In the area of monetary policy , studies will cover aspects of desirable monetary frameworks and monetary transmission .
In the area of banking the studies will cover the problem of deterioration in asset quality , capital raising for banks in the context of Basel III and systemically important banks .
On access to finance , the credit portfolio of Indian banks will be analysed to understand the reach of finance to small borrowers .
In the domain of corporate distress the reasons behind the rise in NPAs and impact of exchange rate volatility on corporate balance sheets will be explored .
Other studies that are contemplated relate to the external sector , fiscal policy , financial integration , investment cycles and wealth effects .
The research staff of the Reserve Bank has also explored possibilities for research collaboration with the in-house experts and visiting academics at the Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning ( CAFRAL ) .
Of particular interest are the subjects related to financial markets and exchange rates .
The Reserve Bank is also planning to revamp the statistical data and information management system , with an emphasis on single point data collection , processing and dissemination .
The objective is to improve data governance practices not only in the Reserve Bank but the banking sector as a whole .
This will involve rationalisation and harmonisation of data across various returns , and data submission through XBRL ( eXtensible Business Reporting Language ) without manual intervention .
For data sharing within and outside the Reserve Bank , a more structured data dissemination policy is envisaged .
These initiatives in the areas of research and statistics are expected to improve analytical assessment in support of policy and operations in the Reserve Bank .
The balance sheet size of the Reserve Bank increased by about 10 per cent during the year ending June 30 , 2014 .
This was mainly due to the expansion of the foreign currency assets , which increased by about 15 per cent .
Gross income of ₹ 646.17 billion for the year 2013-14 registered a fall of 13.10 per cent over 2012-13 , while total expenditure fell by 4.9 per cent from ₹ 125.49 billion to ₹ 119.34 billion .
The year ended with an overall surplus of ₹ 526.79 billion , representing a decrease of 14.75 per cent over the previous year .
The entire surplus was transferred to the government , making it the largest ever transfer by the Reserve Bank .
The balance sheet of the Reserve Bank is largely a reflection of the activities that is carried out in pursuing its currency issue function and its monetary and reserve management policy objectives .
In recognition of the need for greater comparability and transparency , the Reserve Bank has been progressively moving towards greater disclosures in its financial statements .
Accordingly , the key financial results of the Reserve Bank ' s operations during 2013-14 along with the supporting notes to the accounts and statement of significant accounting policies are set out in the following paragraphs .
The year 2013-14 witnessed an overall increase in the size of the balance sheet by ₹ 2,337 billion , / .e. , 9.8 per cent from ₹ 23,907 billion as on 2014 .
The increase in the liabilities side was mainly due to a rise in currency in circulation and accretion to the Currency and Gold Revaluation Account ( CGRA ) .
At the close of the year , the domestic assets constituted 33.0 per cent of total assets while the foreign assets constituted the remaining 67.0 per cent as against 36.2 per cent and 63.8 per cent , respectively as on June 30 , 2013 .
The Technical Committee- | had made several recommendations relating to the format and contents of the Balance Sheet and Profit & Loss Account of the Reserve Bank .
These recommendations covered the manner of reporting of items in the balance sheet , generation of a single balance sheet for Issue and Banking Departments , depiction of each balance sheet head in a single line supported by detailed schedules ( instead of the present practice of reporting only some items with detailed breakups in the balance sheet while explaining composition of other items in the accounts chapter ) , reclassification and grouping of certain items with a view to having better presentation of all material items in the financial statements .
The Board of the Bank has accepted these recommendations for implementation in the year 2014-15 .
The merger of the Balance Sheets is dependent on the notification by the Central Government ; this will be taken forward with the Central Government .
Amendments to the format of the Profit & Loss Account would entail amendments to Regulation 22 of the Reserve Bank of India General Regulations , 1949 ; hence these would be implemented in the year 2014-15 after the revised Balance Sheet format is notifi ed by the Central Government and the revised regulations are approved by the Central Board and notifi ed by the Central Government .
The major recommendations of the Technical Committee II include ( a ) changes in the method of revaluation of the rupee securities from the Lower of Book and Market Value ( LOBOM ) to fair valuation and ( b ) accounting for foreign exchange forward contracts .
The recommendations also elucidate the various risks and the buffers required to take care of the risks arising out of future appreciation in the exchange value of the rupee , future depreciation in the market price of gold and market value of investments in foreign securities , operational & systemic risks , buffers required for further capital expenditure and investment in subsidiaries & associated enterprises .
The recommendations also outline the approach to be followed for transfer of surplus to the Government .
The Balance Sheet and the Profit and Loss Account for the year 2013-14 are as under .
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit .
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India .
Those Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement .
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements .
The procedures selected depend on the auditors ' judgment , including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements , whether due to fraud or error .
In making those risk assessments , the auditors consider internal control relevant to the Bank ' s preparation and correct presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances , but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank ' s internal control .
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by management , as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements .

The financial statements of the Reserve Bank are prepared in accordance with the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) Act , 1934 and the notifications issued there under and in the form prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India General Regulations , 1949 .
As per the current practice , Reserve Bank prepares two balance sheets , one for the Issue Department relating exclusively to its currency management responsibility and the other for the Banking Department reflecting the impact of all other functions of the Reserve Bank .
Section 34 ( 1 ) of the Reserve Bank of India Act requires that all bank notes issued by the Reserve issued by the Government of India before the commencement of operations of the Reserve Bank , be part of the liabilities of the Issue Department .
The currency notes in circulation increased by 11.9 per cent during 2013-14 to ₹ 13,445.16 billion as compared with an increase of 8.9 per cent during 2012-13 and 13.8 per cent in 2011-12 .
The eligible assets of the Issue Department for backing its currency liabilities consist of gold ( coins and bullion ) , foreign securities , rupee coin , Government of India securities ( which remained unchanged at ₹ 10.46 billion ) , internal bills of exchange and other commercial papers .
The Reserve Bank holds 557.75 metric tonnes of gold of which 292.26 metric tonnes are held as an asset of the Issue Department and the balance 265.49 metric tonnes is treated as part of the other assets of the Banking Department .
Consequent upon an increase in the total liabilities of the Issue Department , there was an increase in the supporting assets held in the form of foreign securities from ₹ 11,329.10 billion as on June 30 , 2013 to ₹ 12,783.31 billion as on June 30 , 2014 .
The value of Rupee coins of the Issue Department decreased from ₹ 2.36 billion as on June 30 , 2013
There was no change in the holding of the Government of India Rupee securities which remained at ₹ 10.46 billion .
The Reserve Bank was constituted as a private shareholders ' bank in 1935 with an initial paid-up capital of ₹ 0.05 billion .
The bank was nationalised with effect from January 1 , 1949 and its entire ownership remains vested in the Government of India .
The paid-up capital continues to be ₹ 0.05 billion as per section 4 of the RBI Act .
The original Reserve Fund of ₹ 0.05 billion was created in terms of section 46 of the Reserve Bank of India Act as contribution from the Central Government for the currency liability of the then sovereign government taken over by the Reserve Bank .
Thereafter , an amount of ₹ 64.95 billion was credited to this Fund from out of gains on periodic revaluation of gold up to October 1990 , taking it to ₹ 65 billion .
The accumulation in the fund has been static since then and gain / loss on account of valuation of gold and foreign currency is booked in the Currency and Gold Revaluation Account ( CGRA ) which is part of the head ' Other Liabilities ' in the balance sheet .
Created in July 1964 , under section 46C of the RBI Act with an initial corpus of ₹ 100 million , the fund witnessed annual contribution from the Reserve Bank for financial assistance to eligible financial institutions .
Since 1992-93 , a token amount of ₹ 10 million is being contributed each year to the Fund from the Bank ' s income ; the same practice has been followed for the year 2013-14 as well and the balance in the fund stood at ₹ 230 million as on June 30 , 2014 .
From the year 1992- 93 , only a token amount of ₹ 10 million is contributed each year from the Profit & Loss Account ( Income Statement ) to the Fund .
The balance in the fund stood at ₹ 1,970 million as on June 30 , 2014 .
It may be noted that there are two other Funds constituted under section 46A of the RBI Act , viz . , National Rural Credit ( Long Term Operations ) Fund and National Rural Credit ( Stabilisation ) Fund for which a token contribution of ₹ 10 million each is made every year to the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development ( NABARD ) .
These represent the cash balances maintained with the Reserve Bank by the Central and State Governments , banks , All India financial institutions , such as , Export Import Bank e ( EXIM Bank ) and NABARD , foreign central banks , international financial institutions , balance in different accounts relating to the Employees ' Provident Fund , Gratuity and Superannuation Funds and balance in the newly established Depositor Education and Awareness Fund ( DEA Fund ) .
This Fund was created during the year for promotion of depositors ' interest and for such other purposes which may be necessary for the promotion of depositors ' interests as specified by the Reserve Bank from time to time .
The balance under this head represents the un-encashed DDs / POs and remittances under the erstwhile Remittance Facility Scheme , 1975 .
The major components of ' other liabilities ' are internal reserves and provisions .
While CR and ADR are created from the Bank ' s realised profit , the remaining components of ' Other Liabilities ' , such as , CGRA , Investment Revaluation Account ( IRA ) and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts Valuation Account ( FCVA ) [ previously Exchange Equalisation Account ( EEA ) ] represent unrealised gains / losses .
The Asset Development Reserve , created in 1997-98 , represents the amounts provided out of profits each year to meet internal capital expenditure and make investments in subsidiaries and associated institutions .
The Reserve Bank marks to market the foreign dated securities at market prices on the last business day of each month and the unrealised gains / losses arising therefrom is transferred to the IRA .
As per the revised accounting policy for forward contracts suggested by the Technical Committee II implemented during the year , the Exchange Equalisation Account ( EEA ) which was used for recording the MTM losses on outstanding forward contracts has been renamed as ' Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts Valuation Account ' ( FCVA ) and both the MTM gains as well as losses on foreign exchange forward contracts that are entered into as part of the Bank ' s intervention operations are booked under this head of account .
An amount of ₹ 16.55 billion has been set aside as provisions for the year 2013-14 ; the corresponding figure for the year 2012-13 was ₹ 18.43 billion .
Surplus transferable to the Government of Under Section 47 of the Reserve Bank of India Act , after making provisions for bad and doubtful debts , depreciation in assets , contribution to staff and superannuation fund and for all matters for which provisions are to be made by or under the Act or that are usually provided by bankers , the balance of the profits of the Bank are required to be paid to the Central Government .
Under Section 48 of the Reserve Bank Act , 1934 the Bank is not liable to pay income tax or super tax or any other tax on any of its income , profits or gains and is also exempt from payment of wealth tax .
Accordingly , after adjusting the expenditure including the contribution of an amount of ₹ 40 million for the statutory funds , ₹ 526.79 billion represented the surplus transferable to the government for the year 2013-14 .
The amount which was transferred to the Government on August 11 , 2014 constituted 99.99 per cent of total surplus ( before transfer to four funds ) as compared with 37.2 per cent and 53.4 per cent in 2011-12 and 2012-13 , respectively .
The amount was inclusive of ₹ 0.03 billion towards notional service tax payable on account of the MICR cheque processing charges on a self-assessment basis as was done in the earlier years and ₹ 12.69 billion as against ₹ 13.22 billion in the previous year , payable to the government towards the difference in interest expenditure borne by the Government consequent on conversion of special securities into marketable securities .
This is a residual head including sub accounts , such as , balances payable on account of leave encashment , reserve for interest earned on securities earmarked for the employee funds , the value of collateral held as margin for repo transactions , medical provisions for employees , etc .

The facility for NHB was extended thirteen years ago at a rate of 6 per cent payable half-yearly .
The liquidity support for PDs is primarliy provided so that they have enough reserves to participate in the primary auctions .
The utilisation under this facility increased mainly due to increase in the borrowing programme of Government of India .
Miscellaneous assets comprise mainly loans and advances to staff , amount spent on projects pending completion , the margin offered for reverse repo transactions , security deposit paid , and items in transit representing inter-office transactions ( through the RBI General Account ) , etc .
The value of ' Other Assets ' increased from ₹ 854.56 billion to ₹ 933.37 billion as on amortisation of off- market swaps and MTM gains on revaluation of forward contracts as indicated in above paragraphs .
The Reserve Bank ' s income is drawn from ( i ) Interest receipts , ( ii ) Discount , ( iii ) Exchange , ( iv ) Commission and ( v ) Others including Rent Realised , Profit or loss on sale of Bank ' s property and Provisions no longer required .
Of these , Interest earnings forms the major portion supplemented by relatively small amounts of income from other sources , viz . , discount , exchange , commission and others .
Details of the gross income and the earnings from domestic and foreign sources for the last five years are presented .
The rate of earnings on foreign currency assets was lower at 1.21 per cent in 2013- 14 as compared with 1.45 per cent in 2012-13 due to low interest rates in the international markets during the year ( Table XII.12 ) .
A detailed break-up of the various components of domestic income is provided in Table XII.13.
Inspite of the decrease in the total holding of Rupee securities ( Table XII.8 ) , the income from coupon receipts had gone up from ₹ 408.68 billion in 2012-13 to ₹ 470.53 billion in 2013-14 0n account of net purchases of government securuites worth ₹ 302.83 billion in the year .
However , the overall decrease was primarily on account of increase in depreciation booked on the Rupee securities from ₹ 55.38 billion in 2012-13 to ₹ 480.45 billion in 2013-14 ( as yields generally hardened in 2013-14 as compared with the previous financial year ) .
The net interest income from LAF and MSF increased from ₹ 64.90 billion in 2012-13 to ₹ 76.47 billion in 2013-14 , largely on account of ( i ) increase in the MSF rate by 200 bps in July 2013 and ( ii ) significant portion of LAF borrowings being made through term repo window at rates higher than the prevailing repo rate .
Interest income received on account of WMA / OD from the Centre for July 201 3-June 2014 period stood higher at ₹ 3.22 billion as compared to ₹ 0.67 billion for the corresponding period during 2012-13 .
With the Centre availing of WMA for 52 days and OD for 10 days during the year as compared to WMA for 27 days and no OD in the previous year .
This is attributable to marginally higher monthly average utilisation of WMA / OD by the States at ₹ 58.34 billion in 2013-14 as against ₹ 54.57 billion in 2012-13 .
The total expenditure of the Reserve Bank decreased by 4.9 per cent from ₹ 125.49 billion in 2012-13 to ₹ 119.34 billion in 2013-14 .
The expenditure is broadly categorised into three sub- groups ; viz . , Interest Payment , Establishment Expenditure and Non-establishment Expenditure .
The break-up of the major heads of expenditure is provided in Table XII.14.
The establishment expenses decreased by 26.2 per cent from ₹ 58.59 billion in 2012-13 to ₹ 43.24 billion in 2013-14 .
This can be attributed to decrease in the contribution towards accrued liabilities of the gratuity and superannuation fund and other funds based on the actuarial valuation .
The contribution for the year 2013-14 was ₹ 18.09 billion as against ₹ 35.32 billion in the previous year .
The Bank ' s Investments equivalent to the balances in Provident Fund , Gratuity & Superannuation Fund and Leave Encashment Fund have been ear-marked for these Funds .
Provident Fund and Gratuity & Superannuation Fund are held as ' Deposits ' with the Bank .
The expenditure on underwriting commission increased substantially as PDs quoted higher underwriting commission rates in view of adverse market conditions during the first half of the year .
Fees amounting to ₹ 0.63 billion were paid in 2013-14 to the external asset managers , custodians etc . , who are entrusted with the management of a small portion of the Reserve Bank ' s foreign exchange reserves as against ₹ 0.58 billion in 2012-13 .
The expenditure incurred on security printing charges ( primarily for printing of currency notes ) increased by 11.9 per cent from ₹ 28.72 billion in 2012-13 to ₹ 32.14 billion in 2013-14 .
This rise was mainly on account of an increase of 15.14 per cent in the total supply of banknote forms and a marginal increase in rates quoted by the Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Pvt. Ltd . ( BRBNMPL ) for the currency notes supplied by them .
Other non-establishment expenses consisting of the expenditure on account of remittance of treasure , printing and stationery , audit fees and related expenses , miscellaneous expenses , etc .
Miscellaneous expenses mainly include contributions to various academic , training institutes , etc .
The trends over the last five years in Income , Expenditure and Net Disposable Income have been indicated in Table XII.16.
The statutory auditors of the Bank are appointed by the Central Government in terms of section 50 of the RBI Act , 1934 .
Over the year gone by , the Indian economy remained resilient in a global environment characterised by falling macroeconomic risks but rising financial stability risks
While a modest recovery is tentatively gaining foothold in advanced economies , activity slowed across a broad swathe of emerging economies as commodity prices fell , financing conditions tightened and structural constraints started building .
India is a notable exception .
Globally , financial risks increased as investors reached for yields , expecting US monetary policy to normalise more slowly .
Incipient threats to financial stability were also evident in rising corporate indebtedness in both advanced and emerging economies , stretched asset valuations in some sectors , marked increase in exchange rate volatility and the debt crisis in Greece in the closing months of 2014-15 .
Spillovers from these external shocks impacted various segments of the financial markets in India , asset prices and capital flows , although the latter remained by and large buoyant .
Even as banking sector risks remained elevated domestically , the macroeconomic fundamentals of the Indian economy improved gradually over the year , anchored by some easing of inflation and continuing fiscal consolidation .
Notwithstanding deterioration in export performance brought on , inter alia , by weak external market conditions , the current account deficit narrowed in 2014-15 from its level a year ago on terms of trade gains and weak import demand .
With fiscal consolidation firmly underway and with buoyant business optimism , the stage is now set for unshackling stalled investments and for boosting new capital spending in order to accelerate the pace of growth .
Drawing on the experience of 2014-15 , it is now time to implement an agenda to take the economy to higher growth in 2015-16 and over the medium- term .
Concomitantly , recent gains in reducing inflation pressures need to be built upon so that disinflation continues along with higher growth .
Importantly , resolute actions are needed to ease stress in financial assets , mitigate / resolve debt burdens so that stranded assets are put back to work quickly wherever feasible and capital buffers are built to enable financial intermediaries to provide adequate flow of credit to productive sectors .
Where available , the data have been updated beyond March 2015 .
For the purpose of analysis and for providing proper perspective on policies , reference to past years as also prospective periods , wherever necessary , has been made in this Report .
The improvement in the financial saving of households and the expected decline in government dissaving in 2014-15 should work towards releasing the financing constraints on investment , especially when seen in conjunction with the step-up in capital goods production in the latter half of 2014-15 .
On the production side , the weather induced slowdown in agriculture impacted rural demand and also necessitated policy interventions to manage food price pressures .
In the industrial sector , a turnaround in manufacturing in the latter half of the year was essentially driven by upbeat business sentiment , some unclogging of stalled projects and a robust improvement in electricity generation and coal production in the closing months .
A durable upturn in new capex , capacity utilisation and new orders both domestic and foreign holds the key to a sustained revival of industrial activity .
In the services sector , only a few sub-sectors , such as finance , real estate and construction , grew at higher pace .
Accordingly , inflation expectations eased to single digit for the first time since September 2009 and wage pressures moderated .
A significant factor influencing the evolution of monetary conditions during 2014-15 was the large surge in capital inflows , which necessitated active and nimble liquidity management operations to sterilise flows in accord with the stance of monetary policy .
This highlights the need for more realistic assessment of revenue targets and expenditure allocations .
The contraction in merchandise exports since December 2014 emerged as an area of concern , sapping aggregate demand and increasing external vulnerability , notwithstanding terms of trade gains and a large saving on POL imports helped contain the current account deficit .
Buoyant capital inflows in excess of the external financing requirement raised international reserves to an all time high by the end of the year .
Turning to 2015-16 , the outlook for the global economy has been adversely impacted by the contraction in output in North America in the first quarter of 2015 .
In the second and third quarters , there are indications of demand picking up in advanced economies however , the continuing slowdown in emerging economies holds back a fuller global recovery .
At the same time , with hardening bond yields and risk premia , emerging economies are contending with volatile Currency movements and capital flows .
Going forward , these factors could pose risks to the global recovery .
Accordingly , the IMF has pared its forecast for global growth in 2015 to 3.3 per cent in its July update , marginally lower than in 2014 For the Indian economy , the outlook for growth is improving gradually .
Business confidence remains robust , and as the initiatives announced in the Union Budget to boost investment in infrastructure roll out , they should crowd in private investment and revive consumer sentiment , especially as inflation ebbs .
While the progress of the monsoon has allayed initial fears of moisture shortfall , uncertainty surrounding the progress and distribution of the monsoon remains a risk to the outlook for both growth and inflation .
Comprehensive and pre-emptive food management strategies need to be put in place to contain these spillovers .
In the first four months of 2015-16 , indicators of real activity have broadly tracked the Reserve Bank ' s baseline projection of output growth ( at basic prices ) at 7.6 percent for the year as a whole , up from 7.2 percent in 2014-15 .
Taking into account initial conditions , including the prospects for the monsoon and for international crude prices , the Reserve Bank projected in April 2015 a baseline path for inflation in 2015-16 in which it would be pulled down from current levels by base effects till August but is expected to start rising thereafter to below 6.0 per cent by January 2016 .
So far , inflation outcomes have closely tracked these projections .
The risks to this trajectory are balanced as the weather- related uncertainties are offset by falling crude prices .
Inflation developments will warrant close and continuous monitoring as part of the overall disinflation strategy that requires inflation to be brought down to 5 percent by January 2017 .
As regards fiscal policy , the Government ' s resolve on fiscal consolidation should propel efforts to reach the target for the gross fiscal deficit for 2015-16 at 3.9 percent of GDP .
In the early months of the year , indirect tax collections have been robust and set to achieve budget estimates , though contingent upon a recovery in manufacturing and services .
Furthermore , plans for disinvestment need to be front-loaded to take advantage of supportive market conditions , and also to forestall cutbacks in capital expenditure to meet deficit targets .
States need to take advantage of the greater fiscal autonomy stemming from higher devolutions and prioritise capital and developmental expenditure so that the quality of sub-national fiscal correction is maintained .
In the external sector , merchandise exports have contracted through the first four months of 2015-16 , rendering the economy vulnerable to external shocks .
Non-oil non-gold imports have also moderated due to muted domestic activity .
Over the rest of the year , some savings may accrue on account of POL and bullion imports ; on the other hand , the gradual pick-up in activity anticipated over the rest of the year may revive non-oil non- gold import demand .
Remittances from Indians working abroad have weathered the slowdown in global growth and should continue to lend support to the balance of payments .
Along with a surplus expected on trade in services as in the past , from software exports and travel earnings , the current account deficit for the year as a whole should be contained below 1.5 per centof GDP .
The outlook for capital flows is highly uncertain , with the widely anticipated normalisation of US monetary policy later in 2015 expected to generate capital outflows from emerging markets and also to harden financing conditions as bond yields rise .
In this context , the level of reserves at over US $ 350 billion and equivalent of about nine months of imports should provide a buffer and smooth out normal import and debt servicing requirements over the year .
Key to the realisation of these expectations is a durable pick up in investment , supported by sustained efforts to alleviate supply constraints .
The proposal to introduce a Comprehensive Bankruptcy Code of global standards by 2015- 16 and replacement of the existing multiple prior permission procedure for investments by a pre-existing regulatory mechanism is expected to improve the business environment in India .
Areas that require significant changes include legal and regulatory environment , labour market reforms , tax regime and administrative environment .
Gaps in distribution networks and deteriorating financials of power discoms need to be addressed expeditiously for demand to keep pace with the ongoing easing of supply constraints .
Focusing on renewable and clean sources of energy should be accompanied by conservation of energy as a medium-term strategy .
Expansion of the avenues for gainful employment opportunities is vital for efforts to harness the demographic dividend .
This calls for careful identification of skill gaps , providing vocational and technical training , and building of new skills .
The National Mission for Skill Development which aims at consolidating skill building initiatives spread across several ministries , is relevant in this context .
As self-employment holds out greater employment opportunities , the SETU ( Self Employment and Talent Utilisation ) initiative for supporting all aspects of start-up business and other self-employment activities is crucial .
Other initiatives like Digital India and Make in India will also help to enhance the employment potential .
The macroeconomic environment in 2014-15 was marked by a modest pick-up in activity amidst building internal and external stability , against the backdrop of a tepid and multi-speed global recovery across regions .
Going forward , the economy needs to grapple with significant challenges in the path towards realising its potential and sustaining the growth process .
The distinguishing features of the new series are : ( i ) updating the base year from 2004-05 to 2011-12 ; ( ii ) improved coverage of corporate activity by ( a ) using the MCA 21 database of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs , ( b ) employing value-based indicators such as sales tax collections in conjunction with volume-based indicators such as industrial production , and ( c ) use of results from the latest surveys , including on activity in the unorganised sector ; and ( iii ) methodological changes such as shifting from the ' establishment ' to the ' enterprise ' approach for estimating value added in mining and manufacturing .
In line with international practices , GDP at market prices will henceforth be the headline measure for output .
Gross value added ( GVA ) at basic prices will measure activity from the supply side instead of GDP at factor cost .
In terms of the new series , real activity ( at market prices ) picked up in 2014-15 , rising by 7.3 per cent on top of a growth of 6.9 per cent in 2013-14 ( Chart II.1 ) .
The firming up of growth during 2014-15 was driven mainly by private consumption and supported by fixed investment , even as government consumption and net exports Slackened considerably .
Currently , banking companies , power companies , non-banking financial companies and insurance companies are exempted from compulsory XBRL filing .
For the new series ( base : 2011-12 ) , the CSO has incorporated the accounts of about 5 lakh companies for 2011-12 and 2012-13 , and around 3 lakh common companies for 2013-14 .
The database also covers limited liability partnership companies ( LLPs ) registered with MCA under the LLP Act , 2008 .
Within industry , higher growth was observed in manufacturing and electricity generation .
The share of manufacturing was augmented by trading activity of constituent entities which formed part of services in the old series .
In the services sector , ' financial , real estate , and professional services ' as well as construction were the primary drivers .
On the other hand , the agriculture sector lost momentum , adversely impacted by the deficient southwest monsoon ( SWM ) which affected kharif sowing and by unseasonal rains and hailstorms at the time of rabi harvesting .
Thus , in terms of the new series , India emerged among the fastest growing economies in the world , notwithstanding the still sluggish global economy which dragged down the contribution of net exports to growth in 2014-15 .
In 2013-14 , the gross domestic saving rate declined for the second consecutive year to 30 per cent of gross national disposable income ( GNDI ) ( Table II.1 ) This largely reflected the reduction in the saving rate of households on account of a decline in physical assets as well as in valuables .
As per Reserve Bank ' s latest estimates , household financial saving for 2012-13 and 2013-14 are 7.0 per cent and 7.3 per cent , respectively , of GNDI .
As regards the saving rate of the private corporate sector , non-financial corporations posted a near-steady improvement since 2011-12 , i.e. , since the new series is available , but it appears that this increase may not have sustained in 2014-15 .
Private financial corporations , on the other hand , underwent some erosion in saving rates in 2013-14 , partly reflecting the slowdown in the growth of operating profits of private sector banks .
Available indicators suggest that this has been recouped in 2014-15 .
The ongoing reduction in ' dissaving ' of the general government boosted the gross national saving rate in 2013-14 .
With the perseverance of fiscal consolidation , especially by the centre , the decline in the dissaving of the government sector has likely continued into 2014-15 .
There was , however , a decline in the saving rate of the public financial ( including public sector banks ) and non- financial corporations in 2013-14 .
In case of public sector banks , there was a decline in profit after tax during 2014-15 .
The investment rate ( gross capital formation as a proportion to GDP at current market prices ) declined in 2012-13 and 2013-14 , largely reflecting the slackening in the non-financial corporations ' investment rate on account of weak domestic and external demand and other structural factors such as delay in land acquisition and environment clearances , weak business confidence and policy uncertainties .
The household sector ' s investment rate also declined in 2012-13 and 2013-14 .
The improvement in general government investment in 2013-14 did , however , provide some offset ( Chart II.3 ) .
Viewed in conjunction with other indicators of investment activity such as stalled projects , capital goods imports / production and capex spending , the decline in the private investment intention appears to have become more pronounced in 2014-15 relative to the preceding year .
As per the Reserve Bank ' s data on new projects which were sanctioned financial assistance by banks / financial institutions ( FIs ) or funded through external commercial borrowings ( ECBs ) / foreign currency convertible bonds ( FCCBs ) / domestic capital market issuance , investment intentions for such projects aggregated to ₹ 1,459 billion during 2014-15 as against ₹ 2,081 billion in the previous year .
A turnaround in the investment demand cycle , therefore , assumes critical importance to steer the economy on to a sustainable high growth trajectory .
The recent experience suggests thata strong step- up in public investment may be required to dispel the inertia constraining private investment and to crowd it in , given the robust business sentiment .
Key to this effort will be putting stranded investments in stalled projects back to work while ensuring the availability of key inputs such as power , land ( especially for roads ) and skilled labour .
Steadfast implementation of structural reforms like the goods and services tax ( GST ) is also required to reinvigorate productivity and competitiveness .
The vagaries of the monsoon were in full play during 2014-15 .
The likelihood of EI Nino emerging , was initially placed high , but it eventually did not materialise .
Nevertheless , delay , deficiency , and unevenness in rainfall during the SWM season led to a decline in the production of most kharif crops .
The deficient SWM did not replenish soil moisture adequately and , in addition , the northeast monsoon ( NEM ) also turned deficient .
With the production of most rabi crops estimated lower , the initial hope that a good rabi harvest could make up for the kharif losses was belied .
At the end of the seasons , the SWM turned 12 per cent below the long period average ( LPA ) and the NEM 33 percent below the LPA .
In addition to under-replenishment of reservoirs and intermittent dry halts , a bigger blow to rabi crops , mainly to wheat , came in the form of unseasonal rainfall and hailstorms during late February and early March 2015 .
As per the fourth advance estimates of the Ministry of Agriculture released on August 17 , 2015 , the total foodgrains production declined by 4.6 per cent .
Similarly , the production of oilseeds and cotton declined by 18.5 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively , though that of sugarcane increased by 2.0 per cent .
The impact of a decline in the volume of foodgrains production to 252.7 million tonnes from 265.0 million tonnes a year ago may , however , be mitigated by the availability of food stock buffers of 55.6 million tonnes ( end-July 2015 ) , which is much higher than the buffer norm which varies between 21.0-41.1 million tonnes .
For the 2015 SWM season , the India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) has forecast precipitation at 88 per cent of the LPA in June 2015 , and retained the same forecast in August 2015 with a higher likelihood of El Nino effect intensifying during the season .
Though delayed in arrival , the rainfall was in excess in June barring the last week when a dry Spell set in and continued till mid-July , limiting the season ' s precipitation to 9 per cent below LPA so far ( August 19 , 2015 ) .
In view of these developments , the prospects of kharif harvest 2015 could be expected better notwithstanding the persisting risks to supply shortfalls and likely inflation pressures given the unpredictability of SWM during the remaining part of the season , alongside the need for reappraisal of the degree of weather proofing of Indian agriculture in the context of monsoon vagaries ( Box II.1 ) .
How Monsoon Proof is Indian Agriculture ?
Historically , agricultural failures in India have often been associated with deficient south west monsoons ( SWM ) .
The SWM which constitutes 75-80 per cent of total rainfall received in India , coincides with kharif sowing and is vital for replenishment of ground water , soil moisture and reservoirs and thus crucial for a good rabi harvest as well .
Visual observation of trend growth rates of agriculture seems to suggest resilience at least in some bad monsoon years ( Chart 1 ) .
The absence of multicollinearity between rainfall and sown area is validated by variance inflation factor ( VIF ) .
Clearly , Indian agriculture is yet to become fully weather proof and public policy interventions to insulate crop production from monsoon shocks is an imperative .
Saturation of land use and exhaustion of economies of scale can be halted by multi-pronged strategies covering , inter alia , credit , capital and machinery , technology , research and development , use of improved and hybrid seeds , irrigation and water management , and land reclamation including in arid and semi-arid areas while more vigorously pursuing the scheme of extending the green revolution in the east .
The production of consumer durables continued to shrink as in the previous year , especially telephone instruments , including mobile phones which was due to the one-off closure of Nokia ' s manufacturing unit in Chennai in November 2014 .
Excluding this category , industrial production would have risen by 5.3 per cent during 2014-15 ( Chart II.4 ) .
Higher production of basic metals , electricity and capital goods drove up the index of industrial production ( IIP ) growth during 2014-15 .
In terms of the use-based classification , the production of basic and capital goods accelerated , while that of intermediate goods decelerated and the output of consumer goods contracted .
A diversified approach to agricultural development with emphasis on livestock , fishery , forestry and logging will also buffer agricultural output from SWM variations , provided it is pursued in the overall context of food and nutritional security .
Contingency plans put in place during 2009-10 in the face of a 22 per cent shortfall in SWM warrant careful consideration for replication .
The provision of quality and short duration seeds , agricultural inputs , an active rabi campaign and an action plan for the next cropping season , media telecasting and awareness campaigns , enhanced availability of funds under centrally sponsored programmes , and additional diesel subsidy for irrigation served well , bringing home the point that the impact of adverse monsoon shocks can be ameliorated by pro-active policy measures .

Among other items within the mining sector , the production of crude oil declined on account of ageing oil fields and delay in the execution of new oil field projects .
Also , contraction in the production of natural gas from the KG-D6 block affected natural gas production during 2014-15 as in the previous three years .
Electricity generation registered its highest growth in the last two decades during 2014-15 , facilitated by improved coal supply and higher capacity addition of 22,566 MW ( as against a target of 17,830 MW ) , which is the highest ever achieved in a single year .
Capacity addition , coupled with higher generation and improved transmission capacity resulted in a considerable reduction in power shortage from a level of 7 to 11 per cent during the last two decades to a record low of only 3.6 per cent during 2014-15 .
The plant load factor ( PLF ) in the thermal power sector was largely sustained in 2014-15 .
However , there has been some slippage in the PLF in the first quarter of 2015-16 .
Weakness in consumer spending , sluggish investment activity and poor external demand operated as drags on manufacturing activity during 2014-15 .
Within the manufacturing sector , export- oriented industries like textiles , wearing apparels and refined petroleum products decelerated .
On the other hand , capital goods industries like machinery and equipment and electrical machinery registered improved growth .
During April- June 2015 , however , the growth in IIP decelerated mainly on account of a sluggish performance in capital goods , electricity and food products .
The services sector is estimated to have grown by 9.4 per cent during 2014-15 mainly driven by ' financial , real estate and professional services and construction sector .
As for 2015-16 , available data on lead indicators of services sector including commercial / passenger vehicles sales , air passenger traffic , port and international air cargo , show an improvement over the corresponding period last year .
However , railway freight traffic , domestic air cargo , tourist arrivals , cement production and steel consumption - which provide lead indications of construction activity- show moderation .
During 2014-15 , purchasing managers index ( PMI ) for services remained in an expansionary mode since May 2014 , though the rate of expansion was at a Slower pace in ensuing months .
However , PMI services contracted in May-June 2015 on account of a decline in both output and new orders though it expanded marginally in July 2015 .
Also , given the drag emanating from fiscal consolidation by central and state governments on total spending , ' public administration , defence and other services ' may not serve as a durable growth driver , going forward .
Quarterly employment surveys conducted by the Labour Bureau for select export-oriented sectors reveal that the rate of employment generation in these sectors picked up in 2013 and 2014 , after a significant decline in 2012 .
However , the pace of employment generation is yet to recover to its pre-2010 level .
Information technology- business process outsourcing ( IT-BPO ) and textiles continue to be the key export oriented sectors generating large employment from 2009 to 2014 .
The growth of production in core industries ( coal , crude oil , natural gas , refinery products , fertilisers , steel , cement and electricity ) moderated during 2014-15 ( Chartll.5 ) and remained sluggish during April-June 2015 .
Structural constraints have resulted in a persistent decline in the production of natural gas , crude oil and fertilisers .
The growth of the steel industry was affected by the fall in global prices of steel and the resultant increase in steel imports .
On the other hand , the coal sector ' s impressive growth performance during 2014-15 benefitted from several efficiency enhancing measures taken by the government for Coal India Limited ( CIL ) , like use of mass production technologies , rationalisation of linkages from coal sources to end-users , coordinated efforts with railways for speedy evacuation of coal and shifting to underground mines .
As on mid-August 2015 , the government ' s Project Monitoring Group ( PMG ) has received proposals for 675 projects ( ₹ 10 billion and above or any other critical projects in sectors such as infrastructure , manufacturing and power ) with an estimated project cost of ₹ 28.8 trillion for its consideration .
Out of these , 291 projects worth ₹ 9.9 trillion were cleared by the PMG with the majority of projects pertaining to the power sector , followed by coal , road and petroleum sectors .
While investment through the public-private partnership ( PPP ) mode was the highest in India during 2008 to 2012 as per the World Bank ' s database , thereafter the private participation in prime infrastructure projects in roads and ports decreased sharply .
The focus of the government on construction of highways through the publicly funded engineering , procurement and construction ( EPC ) mode is reflected in a marginal improvement in road construction activity in 2014-15 vis-a-vis 2013-14 ( Chart II.6 ) .
Spectrum auctions in March 2015 elicited vibrant bidding for all the four bands ( 1800 MHz , 900 MHz , 2100 MHz , and 800 MHz ) .
This is the first time that spectrum has been offered simultaneously in all the four bands .
the proposed National Investment and Infrastructure Fund ; tax free infrastructure bonds for projects in the rail , road and irrigation sectors and increased plan outlays for roads and railways .
In order to give a direct thrust to infrastructure investment , the government has stepped in to boost public spending in infrastructure by 700 billion in 2015-16 .
These efforts are also expected to crowd in private participation .
Going forward , the government ' s decision to award new projects only after obtaining the requisite clearances and linkages could catalyse the pace of infrastructure project completion .

In January 2014 , the stance of monetary policy was anchored to a path of disinflation that would take inflation ( measured in terms of y-o-y changes in the all India consumer price index ( combined ) or CPI-C , base 2010 = 100 ) down from 8.6 per cent to below 8 per cent by January 2015 and to below 6 per cent by January 2016 .
This stance was backed by policy rate increases of 25 basis points each in September 2013 , October 2013 and January 2014 .
Although unseasonal food price spikes owing to weather-related transportation disruptions in north India kept inflation stubbornly high till July 2014 , steadfast perseverance with the anti-inflationary monetary policy allowed rate increases in the second half of 2013-14 to feed through into the economy .
Aided by a range of supply management strategies and dramatic plunge in international commodity prices by 28 per cent between September 2014 and February 2015 , inflation persistence ( near double digit CPI inflation for six consecutive years ) was finally broken and headline inflation started easing from August 2014 .
The abatement in food price pressures contributed 76 per cent to the decline in inflation between July and November 2014 .
By April 2015 , it had declined to 4.9 per cent measured by the new CPI series ( base 2012 = 100 ) , thus confirming that disinflation was getting entrenched .
Notwithstanding an uptick in June 2015 to 5.4 per cent , largely reflecting fuel price adjustments and short-term food price pressures , inflation moderated Significantly to 3.8 percent in July 2015 .
Importantly , inflation excluding food and fuel almost halved from 8.3 per cent in May 2014 to 4.2 per cent in March 2015 , providing abiding momentum to the disinflation process .
However , this moved Significantly up to 5.0 per cent in June 2015 before falling to 4.5 per cent in July 2015 .
By December 2014 , households ' inflation expectations ( both three months ahead and one-year ahead ) , which had been ruling in double digits persistently since September 2009 , eased to single digit .
Average inflation at 5.9 per cent during 2014-15 turned out to be significantly lower than 9.5 per cent a year ago ( Chart Il.7 ) .
Intra-year movements in inflation during 2014-15 , however , exhibited three distinct phases - first , weather- related vegetable price pressures till August ; second , the subsequent fall in food prices and pass-through of declining global commodity prices into food , fuel and services prices , resulting in a major shift in the inflation trajectory that took inflation down to an intra-year low of 3.3 per cent in November 2014 ; and finally the reversal of favourable base effect , which pushed inflation up to 5.3 per cent in March 2015 .
Significantly , even as inflation moved up during December 2014 - February 2015 , the month-on-month increase in prices remained moderate or negative , attesting to the sustained abatement of inflation risks .
All the three major constituent groups of CPI- food , fuel and categories excluding food and fuel - contributed to a decline in headline inflation , reflecting improvement in supply conditions and the ebbing of inflation momentum ( Chart II.8 ) , with the largest impact emanating from the food component .
Fuel group ' s contribution to inflation remained marginal , reflective of its relatively lower weight and declining frequency of changes in administered prices of non-transport fuel items .
The fall in inflation , excluding food and fuel , was facilitated by the anti-inflationary monetary policy stance as inflation in most of its sub-components edged down .
The wedge between inflation in food and non-food groups narrowed considerably during 2014-15 ( Chart II.9 ) .
Two major groups - cereals and vegetables - together accounted for almost 80 per cent of the decline in average food price inflation during the year .
Cereals ' inflation declined partly on account of the lower order of revision in minimum support prices ( MSPs ) in 2014-15 ( Table II.5 ) and active supply management under the public distribution system ( PDS ) , including the open market sale of wheat .
Vegetable prices shrugged off bouts of weather-related volatility in H1 of 2014-15 and declined relatively faster in H2 of 2014-15 with policy actions taken to discourage stockpiling , and bringing vegetables under the Essential Commodities Act ( ECA ) .
Sugar prices moderated in tandem with global prices , but protein-rich items ( eggs , fish , meat , milk and pulses ) exhibited downward rigidity in inflation , reflecting structural mismatches between demand and supply .
A number of policy initiatives were taken to improve both supply chain and post-harvest crop management .
These included issuing advisories to states to enable free movement of fruits and vegetables by delisting them from the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee ( APMC ) Act ; bringing onions and potatoes under the purview of ECA , thereby allowing state governments to impose stock limits so as to deal with cartelisation and hoarding and making violation of stock limits a non-bailable offence .
From August 2014 , crude oil prices fell but the full pass-through of this decline was impeded by lingering under-recoveries of the oil marketing companies ( OMCs ) ( Table II.6 ) .
In case of coal , Indian prices have historically remained substantially lower than the global prices .
Therefore , the decline in global coal prices during 2014-15 resulted in bridging the gap between global and domestic prices rather than a fall in domestic prices .
Since the CPI fuel group includes a number of items , such as electricity and kerosene whose prices are administered , prices in this category remained sticky ( Chart II.10 ) .
By the end of the year , the transport and communication category contributed negatively to inflation ( Chart II.11 ) .
Also , housing inflation showed a much more Significant moderation under the new Series ( base 2012 = 100 ) partly on account of methodological improvements , which included doubling the sample size for collection of rentals data from 6,684 rented dwellings in the old series to 13,368 in the revised series .
Inflation in services components , such as health , education and household requisites declined , reflecting a slowdown in wage growth .
Input cost pressures from fuel , farm inputs and rural wages ebbed significantly during 2014- 15 .
After the high and unprecedented rise in rural wages during 2007-08 to 2012-13 , the recent slowdown in wage growth has evoked academic and policy interest .
Average wage growth , as per the new wage Series , for November 2014 to May 2015 , remained at 3.9 per cent for agricultural and 5.7 per cent for non-agricultural occupations , respectively .
This was substantially lower than the annual average rate of 16 per cent for agricultural occupations and 14 per cent for non-agricultural occupations during the six-year period from 2007 to 2013 .
However , the role of productivity will have to be examined carefully while assessing the durability of the impact of the changes in wage growth on inflation ( Box II.2 ) .
Since November 2014 , wholesale prices have moved into contraction [ ( - ) 4.1 per cent in July 2015 , y-o-y ] ( Chart II.12 ) .
Prices of non-food manufactured products also contracted in July 2015 [ ( - ) 1.4 per cent , y-o-y ] , indicating the extent of slack in the economy as well as falling cost pressures .
Global commodity prices declined sharply amidst improved supply , large spare capacity and weak demand conditions in 2014-15 ( Chart II.13 ) . During the initial part of the year , crude oil prices hardened on account of supply outages Libya , Nigeria and Syria .
From August 2014 , global crude oil prices fell substantially , driven by abundant supplies of North American shale oil and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) decision not to cut production at its November 2014 meeting .
An increase in rural wages can influence prices , both by increasing demand and pushing up the cost of production .
On the other hand , wage growth in itself could respond to high price increases , particularly food price increases .
The wage-inflation nexus also works through productivity - as labour productivity increases , wages rise .
An increase in labour productivity will reduce unit labour cost , which is the average cost of labour per unit of output ( usually calculated as the ratio of total labour costs to real output ) and therefore , it will be possible to pay a higher wage without an increase in final output price .
On the other hand , if wage increases are unaccompanied by productivity increases , rise in unit labour costs will lead to further increase in output prices and hence inflation .
This dynamics is more complex in a regional perspective , where there is large heterogeneity in product and labour markets .
A comparison between agricultural labour productivity and agricultural wages at the all-India level as well as for major states is insightful .
Real wage growth , i.e. , growth in agricultural wages adjusted for CPI - agricultural labourers ( AL ) inflation , remained moderate during 1999-00 to 2009- 10 .
Subsequently , it went up sharply during 2009-10 to 2011-12 ( Chart 1 ) .
This trend was broad-based and observed in major agricultural states like Bihar , Maharashtra , Madhya Pradesh , Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh .
Agricultural labour productivity declined in some states over the period from 1999-2000 to 2004-05 , but went up subsequently during the period 2009-10 to 2011-12 at the all-India level as well as for major states ( Chart 2 ) .
The productivity improvement was partly contributed by a shift in labour force from agricultural to non-agricultural occupations , which led to a decline in the total number of persons engaged in agriculture in 2011-12 vis-a-vis 2004- 05 .
Thus , the sharp increase in real wages in recent years was partly offset by a rise in productivity .
The impact of rural wage increases on rural food prices was not as large due to commensurate rise in productivity ( Goyal and Baikar 2014 ) .
Post-2013 , real wage growth declined in India barring a few states like Madhya Pradesh , Uttar Pradesh , Gujarat and Tamil Nadu .
The fall in real wage growth is mainly contributed by a fall in nominal wage growth .

Indian basket prices firmed up to US $ 63.8 per barrel in May 2015 but declined subsequently to US $ 49 per barrel by mid-August 2015 as supply prospects improved with the clinching of the nuclear deal by Iran with the major world powers .
Metal prices edged down in 2014 aided by surplus supplies and slowing demand conditions in emerging economies , particularly in China .
Global food prices declined by 3.8 percent in 2014 as large accumulated stocks continued to pull down international prices of commodities , such as cereals , oils and sugar .
The Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) , in its update of July 2015 , forecast that the world cereals production might decline by 1.1 per cent in 2015 while exceptionally high stocks were likely to compensate for the production shortfall .
During 2015 so far , prices have continued to move downwards for almost all food items , with large supplies and slow trading activity as buyers are expecting a further fall in prices in the coming months .
In order to capture shifting consumption pattern of households , the Central Statistics Office ( CSO ) revised the base year of CPI to 2012 from its earlier base of 2010 , using the weighting pattern from the latest consumer expenditure survey ( CES ) , 2011-12 of the National Sample Survey Office ( NSSO ) .
Methodologically , the new series has incorporated certain improvements : a weighting pattern based on the modified mixed reference period ( MMRP ) ; internationally accepted ' classification of individual consumption according to purpose ' with suitable deviations ; and the use of a geometric mean to compute indices at the elementary / item level .
Along with the prices of items under the above poverty line ( APL ) and below poverty line ( BPL ) categories , prices of items under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana ( AAY ) are also incorporated in the new series .
The revision has a number of policy implications : lower sensitivity of the overall index to food price shocks and idiosyncratic price movements and incisiveness in identifying sources of inflation at the item level .
In July , however , inflation declined significantly to 3.8 per cent aided by favourable base effect and ebbing food price pressures .
Excluding food and fuel , inflation moved up substantially to 5.0 per cent in June 2015 from 4.2 per cent in March 2015 on account of a broad-based rise in inflation in services segment , such as health and education as well as retail fuel price increases captured by the transport and communication sub-group .
It , however , moderated to 4.5 per cent in July 2015 tracking lower transport costs with recent fall in fuel prices .
Importantly , household inflation expectations returned to double digits in June 2015 quarter .
Monetary and credit conditions remained sluggish through 2014-15 as reflected in the subdued growth in key monetary and banking aggregates .
Consequently , reserve money grew at a subdued pace , reflecting the slow pace of economic activity as well as the anti-inflationary monetary policy stance of the Reserve Bank .
Growth of money supply ( M ) also slowed in relation to the preceding year reflecting the interaction of a number of factors .
First , credit demand was muted reflecting the slack in the economy .
Second , increasing levels of non- performing assets ( including restructured assets ) imparted an element of risk aversion across the banking sector .
This inhibited credit supply , especially to stressed sectors such as infrastructure , with substitution at the margin in loan portfolios in favour of personal loans and retail lending where the incidence of non-performing assets ( NPAs ) was markedly less .
Accordingly , banks tended to moderate their access to deposits which were also impacted by inadequate real returns relative to competing financial assets of households and corporate entities .
During 2014-15 , reserve money expanded by 11.3 per cent , down from 14.4 per cent a year ago .
On the components side , currency in circulation , constituting around 75 per cent of reserve money , increased by 11.3 per cent .
The pick-up in currency demand from 9.2 per cent a year ago reflected the interaction of several factors -election-induced demand for currency and increased food subsidy ( Chart II.14 ) .
On the other hand , growth of bankers ' deposits with the Reserve Bank slowed to 8.3 per cent , mainly reflecting the deceleration in deposit growth .
The maintenance of reserves evened out across 2014-15 following the introduction of minimum daily CRR balances of 95 per cent since September 2013 .
Average daily excess reserve holdings by the banking sector declined from around 3 per cent in 2013-14 to 2 per cent in 2014-15 , which indicated some efficiency gains under the new liquidity management framework introduced in September 2014 .
A system level liquidity flux appears to have eased with assurance On availability of liquidity as needed .
On the sources side , there was a change in the composition of reserve money in 2014-15 in terms of net domestic assets ( NDA ) and net foreign assets ( NFA ) .
With the emergence of India as a preferred destination for foreign capital , the Reserve Bank ' s foreign exchange operations to mitigate undue volatility in the foreign exchange market resulted in a large increase in NFA , injecting around ₹ 3.2 trillion primary liquidity ( reserve money ) into the financial system .
Concomitantly , NDA ( adjusted for net non-monetary liabilities ) declined by around ₹ 1.9 trillion to partially sterilise the impact of the Reserve Bank ' s forex market operations on reserve money expansion .
Global financial markets have been roiled by turbulence associated with divergence in monetary policy stances in the G3 economies .
During 2014-15 , significant shifts in monetary policy settings were also observed among emerging economies to manage the effects of G3 monetary policies on their financial systems transmitted through capital flows and asset prices as also to deal with domestic fragilities which restrained growth and made them vulnerable to financial shocks .
Cross-border externalities associated with the conduct of unconventional monetary policies in advanced and emerging economies alike occupied centre-stage in 2014-15 ( Box II.3 ) .
In response to these global factors affecting domestic liquidity conditions , the Reserve Bank endeavoured to contain the expansionary effects in keeping with its commitment to the glide path of disinflation .
'Spillovers ' have come to be commonly employed in the post-unconventional monetary policy ( UMP ) literature to refer to the beneficial or damaging effects that a country ' s economic policies can have on other nations .
In the more recent period , the focus has largely been on negative externalities associated with the Fed ' s quantitative easing ( QE ) and its widely anticipated normalisation , especially as the Fed ' s forward guidance on it has been data-dependent and consequently , every incoming data has triggered intense market reactions on its possible timing .
In the event , UMPs have generated large capital flows to emerging market economies ( EMEs ) in an indiscriminate search for yields , while exit from them has increased the risks of substantial capital outflows of which the taper tantrum of the summer of 2013 provided a sinister preview .
Quite naturally , spillovers from UMPs have been the subject of acrimonious disharmony ( Taylor 2013 ) .
Given the heterogeneity in the structural characteristics of EMEs , it is important to nuance these findings and qualify them with country-specific experiences .
For India , an analysis of the impact of spillovers from the Fed ' s QEs using a combination of methodologies , such as the event study framework , generalised method of moments ( GMM ) and vector auto-regressions ( VARs ) shows that the largest favourable impact came from QE1 that pushed capital flows into India , helping finance a widening current account deficit .
QE2 , unlike QE1 , was associated with capital outflows from India .
These spillovers were transmitted mainly through the portfolio rebalancing channel , followed by the liquidity channel ( Patra et al.2014 ) .
The larger global role played by EMEs implies that spillbacks from fluctuations in their growth as a result of shocks in advanced economies can be non- trivial .
VAR specifications suggest that about 50 per cent of the fluctuations in outputs in advanced economies spill over onto EMEs of which one-third spill back to advanced economies ( IMF 2014 ) ( Table 1 ) .
Spillback effects are more pronounced for Japan and the euro area , and less for the United States and the United Kingdom due to stronger trade linkages ( Trade openness for the US and the UK is relatively far less ) .
Significant at the 10 per cent level .
Fratzscher , Marcel , Marco Lo Duca and Roland Straub ( 2013 ) , ' On the International Spillovers of US Quantitative Easing ' , Working Paper Series No. 1557 , June .
The Reserve Bank , therefore , appropriately calibrated repo auctions and open market operation ( OMO ) sales , both outright and on the Negotiated Dealing System-Order Matching ( NDS-OM ) platform to contract NDA and offset the large increase in NFA ( Chart II.15 ) .
Quarterly movements in reserve money in 2014-15 evolved in line with changing drivers of liquidity and resulting composition shifts in the Reserve Bank ' s balance sheet .
On the components side , except for the seasonal decline in Q2 , currency in circulation increased throughout the year .
Taylor John B. ( 2013 ) , ' International Monetary Policy Coordination : Past , Present and Future ' , Paper prepared for presentation at the 12th BIS Annual Conference on ' Navigating the Great Recession : What Role for Monetary Policy ' , Lucerne , Switzerland , June 21 .
Consequently , reserve money growth increased in the last quarter of 2014-15 .
There was also a change in the composition of NDA during 2014-15 which was in accordance with modifications in the Reserve Bank ' s accounting policies as recommended by the Technical Committee formed to review the format of the balance sheet and the profit and loss account of the Reserve Bank ( Chairman : Shri Y.H. Malegam ) .
Specifically , net repo operations are now being recorded under the Reserve Bank ' s credit to banks and commercial sector rather than in its credit to general government as was done earlier .
These accounting changes are reflected in a decline in the Reserve Bank ' s net credit to the government and the commensurate increase in its net claim on banks in 2014-15 , though the absolute size of NDA remains unaffected .
Movements in reserve money influence the broader measures of money supply through the money multiplier .
In terms of magnitude , the money multiplier stood at 5.5 in March 2015 , unchanged from its level a year ago .
Both the cash deposit ratio and the cash reserve ratio remained unchanged over the year , imparting stability to the money multiplier .
The money supply growth slowed down in 2014-15 ( Table II.8 ) , mainly reflecting easing inflation which lowered the demand for money .
The slowdown in money supply in general , and in aggregate deposits in particular , vis-a-vis 2013-14 has to be seen in the context of the base effect caused by the swap facility for FCNR ( B ) deposits operated by the Reserve Bank during S eptember- November 2013 which led to high mobilisation of these deposits in 2013-14 .
Money supply net of FCNR ( B ) deposits was marginally lower in 2014-15 than in the preceding year .
However , money supply improved in the second half of the year ( March 2015 over September 2014 ) in line with the growth in credit .
In tandem , the year-on-year growth in the liquidity aggregate L1 [ sum of the new monetary aggregate ( NM ) and postal deposits ] remained marginally lower than a year ago .
Growth in aggregate deposits , which forms a major component of money supply , has generally been declining over the years in line with a decrease in the saving rate of the economy .
In addition , Slowdown in credit growth led to lower deposit mobilisation by banks .
The growth in aggregate deposits decelerated to 10.6 per cent in 2014-15 from 14.1 per cent a year ago .
On the sources side , a decline in banks credit growth to the commercial sector was one of the key drivers .
Another major constituent from the sources side , that is , net bank credit to the government declined during the year mainly due to reduction in the Reserve Bank ' s holding of government securities ( G-secs ) .
Commercial banks , on the other hand , stepped up their investment in G-secs in view of credit deceleration during the year .
The velocity of money ( Chart II.16 ) , which declined over the past six decades hovered around 1.25 , indicating stability of the financial system in the post-crisis years . Another commonly referred indicator of financial deepening - M to GDP ratio - which is a reciprocal of velocity , stood at around 80 .
Non-food credit growth decelerated sharply in 2014-15 to 9.3 per cent ( y-o-y ) , with incremental non-food credit declining to ₹ 5.5 trillion from ₹ 7.3 trillion in the previous year .
A host of factors weighed down on credit off-take , including lower corporate sales , softening of inflation rate , risk aversion by banks due to rise in non-performing loans , and procedural delays in debt recovery ( Box II.4 ) .
Countries which experienced high growth since 2000 also witnessed a surge in private credit ( Claessens et al.2011 ) .
An empirical analysis also suggests that credit growth is positively influenced by deposit growth , GDP growth , easy global liquidity conditions and exchange rate depreciation , whereas inflation dampens real credit growth ( Guo and Stepanyan 2011 ) .
In India ' s bank- based financial system , credit plays an important role in the overall growth dynamics .
At the aggregate level , the NPA ratio and credit growth exhibited a statistically significant negative correlation of 0.8 , based on quarterly data since 2010-11 .
Applying the methodology of Guo and Stepanyan ( 2011 ) to Indian quarterly data from June 1997 to September 2014 , non-food credit was found to be influenced by lagged real GDP growth in a positive and statistically significant manner .
The cost of credit proxied by the overnight call rate , as expected , had a negative impact on credit growth .
The impact of the interest rate was found to be strong up to two lags , reflecting transmission lags .
In line with the theory , the coefficient of gross fiscal deficit ( GFD ) of the Centre had a negative sign , indicating crowding out effects of fiscal deficit in market for bank credit .
Finally , the change in outstanding commercial papers ( CPs ) , a proxy for an alternative source of funds , had a negative and significant coefficient .
Sale of significantly larger amount of non-performing loans ( ₹ 317 billion ) by banks to asset reconstruction companies ( ARCs ) during 2014- 15 also contributed to a deceleration in bank credit .
Guo K. and V. Stepanyan ( 2011 ) , ' Determinants of Bank Credit in Emerging Market Economies ' , IMF Working Paper WP / 11 / 51 .
With the deceleration in non-food credit growth on a year-on-year basis , nearly 80 per cent of the incremental credit off-take during 2014-15 took place in the second half of the year , reflecting the improving economic environment ( Charts II.17 and II.18 ) .
In order to create more space for banks to expand credit to the productive sectors of the economy , the statutory liquidity ratio ( SLR ) was reduced in three stages from 23 per cent to 21.5 per cent of net demand and time liabilities ( NDTL ) during 2014-15 .
However , banks continued to maintain SLR investments around 28 per cent of NDTL , the buffer providing access to collateralised borrowings from the wholesale funding market and the Reserve Bank .
Maintaining excess SLR securities also helped banks to weather the impact of the current slow phase of the economic cycle on their balance sheets and earnings .
1.3.15 Data on sectoral deploymentof credit , which constitutes about 95 per cent of total bank credit by SCBs , indicate that deceleration in credit off-take in 2014-15 was more pronounced with respect to the industry and services sectors , which together constituted about 68 per cent of total non-food credit .
Credit growth in the services sector was weighed down by its major components : trade and non-banking financial companies ( NBFCs ) that accounted for nearly 48 per cent of the total credit to the services sector .
In the industrial sector , growth slowed down across sectors , particularly for infrastructure , basic metals and food processing .
The sectors which witnessed lower incidence of NPAs such as personal loans saw higher growth during the year .
Infrastructure accounts for nearly one-third of the credit to the industrial sector .
Its main components are power and roads , constituting 60 and 18 per cent of the total infrastructure credit respectively .
While deceleration in credit to the power sector was modest , the slowdown was sharp with respect to roads in 2014-15 ( Table II.9 ) .
During 2015-16 so far ( up to August 7 ) , credit off-take seems to be picking up reflecting an improving economic and policy environment , though it is too early for a conclusive evidence .
Incremental non-food credit stood around ₹ 1,282 billion as against ₹ 963 billion during the corresponding period last year .
Data on sectoral deployment ( up to June 2015 ) reveal a significant pick-up in services mainly supported by trade and professional services , while industry registered a decline .
Within industry , although credit to infrastructure shows signs of pick-up , that to roads continues to be weak ( Chart ॥ .19 ) .
Amongst the non-bank domestic sources , net issuance of CPs witnessed a four-fold increase during the year , mainly attributable to competitive pricing vis-a-vis banks ' lending rates .
Further , FDI inflows remained strong and accounted for a major chunk of the non-bank foreign resources to the commercial sector .
Reliance on non-bank sources continues during 2015-16 so far ( up to August 7 ) amidst comfortable liquidity conditions and competitive rates .
Regime shifts in the conduct of monetary policy shaped monetary and credit conditions in 2014-15 .
Money supply and other key monetary aggregates decelerated in line with underlying macroeconomic activity .
Overall , credit growth was subdued during 2014-15 owing to various factors , such as risk aversion by banks due to rising NPAs and alternative and cheaper sources of non-bank funding , though there was some evidence that a turnaround in the second half of the year might have set in .
A number of stock markets also reached historical highs during 2014-15 as fears about US monetary policy rates lifting off receded and the ECB and the BoJ enhanced their asset purchase programmes .
However , markets experienced some volatility in mid-October 2014 on account of uncertainty on the global recovery , a Slew of weak data from the US and the euro area and continuing geo-political tensions in the Middle East .
Again in the second half of December 2014 , markets were affected by the Ukrainian crisis followed by the Russian currency crisis and large exchange rate depreciation in Venezuela and Argentina ( Chart II.21b ) .
The US dollar index , which measures the dollar ' s movement against other major currencies , strengthened by 23 per cent from 80.1 at end-March 2014 to 98.4 at end-March 2015 .
While it strengthened primarily on account of a robust US economic recovery , weak economic recovery in the euro zone and Japan during the year resulted in the euro and the Japanese yen depreciating against the US dollar .
In January 2015 , as ECB prepared to announce quantitative easing , the Swiss National Bank ( SNB ) abandoned its cap on the Swiss franc / euro exchange rate which led to heightened exchange rate volatility .
During Q4 of 2014-15 , a number of emerging markets and developing economies ( EMDEs ) reduced their policy rates to support economic growth .
Interventions in foreign exchange markets to address depreciating pressures also increased .
In May 2015 , markets were surprised by the global bond sell-off that started in Germany as the 10-year German Bund yield increased to intra-day high of 0.77 per cent on May 7 from 0.05 per cent on April 17 , 2015 ।
During June 2015 , movements in international financial markets were abuzz with uncertainty relating to the outcome of Greek debt negotiations and meltdown in the Chinese stock market .
In August , the global financial markets were shaken by China ' s decision to devalue its currency by around 2 per cent .
Both domestic and global cues were at play in buoying Indian financial markets during 2014-15 .
Yields on government securities ( G-secs ) declined gradually and activity in the corporate bond market registered an increase mainly due to primary issuances .
Overnight call money rates remained closely aligned to the policy repo rate , with active liquidity management operations under the revised liquidity management framework , except adjustment for the year-end window dressing .
Money market rates declined in Q4 in sync with cuts in the policy rate ( Chart ॥ .22 ) .
With deposit growth generally remaining above credit growth during the year , structural liquidity conditions remained comfortable .
During 2015-16 so far , call money rates have remained aligned to the policy repo rate with money market rates declining after the cut in policy rate on June 2 , 2015 .
The spread of the daily weighted average Call rate ( excluding Saturdays ) over the policy rate narrowed down significantly during 2014-15 from 30 basis points ( bps ) to 18 bps after the adoption of the revised liquidity management framework in September 2014 .
The spread further narrowed down to 16 bps during 2015-16 ( upto August 14 ) .
The spread of collateralised rates ( CBLO and market repo ) also narrowed down during this period , indicating synchronised movement among overnight money market rates .
The collateralised segment continued to attract a major portion of the turnover in the overnight market , with the uncollateralised ( call money ) segment registering relatively thin volumes , rendering it susceptible to bouts of volatility .
A large part of the assured liquidity support under the Reserve Bank ' s liquidity adjustment facility ( LAF ) is being offered through variable rate term repos with one of its main objectives being development of the term money market .
The average fortnightly issuance of certificates of deposits ( CDs ) decreased to ₹ 297 billion during 2014-15 from ₹ 306 billion during the previous year ( Chart II.23 ) .
The easing of liquidity conditions , coupled with a reduction in the policy rate and relatively lower issuances of CDs by banks on the back of subdued credit off-take , led to a decrease in the weighted average effective interest rate ( WAEIR ) on CDs from 9.74 per cent at end- March 2014 to 8.58 per cent at end-March 2015 .
The average fortnightly issuance of commercial papers ( CPs ) increased by 58 percent to ₹ 479 billion during 2014-15 , reflecting substitution of short-term bank credit by market based funding on account of the cost effectiveness of CPs for raising funds on the back of significant easing of yields on corporate bonds ( Chart ll.24 ) .
Consequently , the outstanding amount of CPs stood higher at ₹ 1,933 billion at end-March 2015 as compared to ₹ 1,066 billion at end-March 2014 .
The weighted average discount rate ( WADR ) for CPs decreased to 9.26 per cent at end-March 2015 from 9.92 per centat end-March 2014 , reflecting easing of liquidity conditions during the year and overall downward movement in the interest rate cycle .
The declining trend has continued during 2015-16 so far with WADR standing at 7.97 per cent at end-July 2015 .
G-secs yields generally softened through 2014-15 , reflecting easing of US treasury yields , active buying interest by foreign portfolio investors ( FPIs ) , sharp decline in inflation , improvement in the fiscal situation , positive sentiment after the general elections , steep decline in international oil prices and cuts in policy rate by the Reserve Bank .
Some uptick in yields occurred in June and July 2014 due to geo-political tensions in the Middle East as also the announcement of higher net market borrowing in the Union Budget for 2014-15 .
Yields spiked again in the second half of December 2014 on account of geo-political tensions and the Russian currency crisis .
However , the yields softened in Q4 following increased buying by FPIs .
Sustained buying interest in government debt by FPIs was discernible as their limit remained almost fully utilised , notwithstanding certain conditions such as debarring FPIs from investing in treasury bills and permitting incremental investment only in G-secs with minimum residual maturity of three years .
Notably , the G-secs market weathered the impact of a complete exit from the assets purchase programme by the Federal Reserve in October 2014 with the yields continuing to exhibit a softening bias on the back of buoyant investor sentiment ( Chart ॥ .25 ) .
Bearish sentiment took hold in the G-secs market in February 2015 for a variety of reasons , including , but not limited to , a broadly unchanged size of the government market borrowing programme for 2015-16 and rescheduling of the fiscal consolidation plan by a year as announced in the Union Budget for 2015-16 .
However , the follow-up policy rate cut of 25 bps each on January 15 , 2015 and March 4 , 201 , coupled with a sharp fall in US treasury yields , buoyed the market sentiment and led to softening of the 10-year G-Sec yield .
The yield has , however , softened thereafter with the introduction of a new 10-year benchmark security , cut in policy rate and significant decline in inflation .
The G-secs turnover ratio moved up to 1.95 per cent in 2014-15 from 1.87 per cent in the previous year .
FPls in the equity and debt markets in India revived during 2014-15 .
While FPI inflows to the debt market turned positive at ₹ 1.6 trillion facilitated by an increase in the FP sub-limit by US $ 5 billion within the overall limit of US $ 30 billion , FPI investments in equity markets were also higher than they were in 2013-14 ( Chart II.27 ) .
Currently , FPI investors are permitted to invest only in bonds with the minimum residual maturity of three years so as to encourage investments in long term securities and to contain interest rate volatility at the shorter end .
During 2014-15 , turnover in the corporate bond market increased by 12 per cent to $ 10,913 billion ( Chart II.28a ) .
On the other hand , the yield spread of 5-year AAA rated corporate bonds over G-secs of corresponding maturity declined until mid-November 2014 following the crash in global crude oil prices , stability in the exchange market and Moody ' s outlook upgrade .
Subsequently , however , frictional liquidity pressure on account of advance tax payments and concerns over the rise in the current account deficit for Q2 of 2014 led to a widening of the spreads until mid-January 2015 .
Following the cuts in the policy repo rate and improved liquidity conditions , yield spreads declined in Q4 of 2014-15 ( Chart II.28b ) .
During 2015-16 so far , the yield spread remained range bound , indicating easy liquidity conditions .
Equity market sentiment was supported by political stability , sustained FPI flows , lower international crude oil prices and Softening of the policy rate .
The equity market was also supported by global liquidity conditions and the search for yield aided by the US Federal Reserve ' s commitment to low interest rates , ultra-accommodative monetary policies pursued by the ECB , the BoJ and the People ' s Bank of China .
In US dollar terms , the Sensex rose by 20 per cent , turning out to be one of the best performing markets in the world ( Chart Il.29b ) .
The domestic equity market also witnessed lower volatility in 2014-15 as compared to equity markets abroad .
However , benchmark indices recovered after realisation of above normal rainfall in June .
Domestic markets also received support from positive developments relating to Greece and the Iran nuclear deal .
In August 2015 , the stock markets remained range bound guided , among others , by mixed earnings for Q1 of 2015-16 and global developments such as China ' s currency devaluation .
During 2014-15 , resource mobilisation through equity issues , including qualified institutional placement ( QIP ) rose significantly by 44 per cent ( Table II.10 ) .
There were signs of renewed interest in initial public offerings ( IPOs ) with an increase in the number of companies filing draft red herring prospectuses ( DRHPs ) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) to raise resources in 2015-16 .
Going forward , positive sentiment in the secondary market , if sustained , will help raise larger resources through the primary market .
Mobilisation through private placement of corporate bonds at ₹ 4,041 billion was significantly higher by 46 per cent during 2014-15 , while public issues of non-convertible debentures at ₹ 97 billion were much lower .
Mobilisation through public issues of bonds is set to witness a revival in 2015-16 with the Union Budget 2015-16 proposing to raise resources through tax-free bonds for funding infrastructure .
The Central Government has budgeted a receipt of ₹ 695 billion through disinvestment in 2015-16 , of which ₹ 285 billion is expected to be mobilised through strategic disinvestments .
Measures , such as the introduction of e-IPO norms and allowing firms to launch real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) and infrastructure investment trusts ( InvITs ) as also the government ' s disinvestment measures are expected to provide an impetus to the capital markets going forward .
However , it moved up in the first three quarters of 2014-15 , suggesting a moderate pick up in house price growth , particularly in cities like Delhi and Kolkata ( Chart ll.30 ) .
The demand for residential properties has slowed down in recent times and unsold stock of residential homes has increased considerably at the same time .
Genuine home buyers moved away from the housing market due to higher prices and investors stayed away due to the weakening State of the economy .
As the economic growth has Started to take-off , the overall buyer sentiment is expected to rise .
Presumably , developers are counting on this to happen and hence holding the price .
Financial markets in India performed well during 2014-15 .
G-secs yields generally softened in 2014-15 in line with a decline in inflation and continued buying interests by FPls .
Equity markets , primary as well as secondary , fared better than in the previous year .
Public finances have been gradually improving at the level of both the Centre and the states .
The impetus for rectitude has mainly emanated from a re-commitment to calibrated paths of fiscal consolidation in the post-global crisis period .
Initially quantity-driven , these efforts have been guided by the imperative to stabilise fiscal consolidation on the chosen trajectories and then to re-order expenditure priorities from subsidies to investment , to raise tax buoyancy , to rationalise non- developmental spending and leakages and to contain public debt at sustainable levels for all layers of the government .
With annual budgetary targets for the gross fiscal deficit ( GFD ) met since 2012-13 , attention has increasingly turned to the quality of fiscal consolidation .
Key deficit indicators of the Central Government were lower in 2014-15 , as per the provisional accounts ( PA ) , than a year ago .
GFD was lower than the budgetary target , both in absolute terms and as percentage of GDP .
In 2014-15 ( provisional accounts ) , non-debt receipts were sluggish reflecting tepid domestic activity .
While gross tax collection suffered a shortfall of 8.8 per cent from the budget estimates ( BE ) , net tax inflows turned out to be 7.7 per cent lower than BE , mainly on account of subdued indirect tax receipts .
Non-tax revenue was also lower than BE due to lower collections from general , economic , fiscal and social services .
Non-debt capital receipts were significantly lower than the budgetary target , reflecting a large shortfall in disinvestment proceeds .
The shortfall in non-debt receipts warranted a sharp cutback in plan expenditure by more than 20 per cent , both on the revenue and capital accounts , in order to meet deficit targets .
A marginal reduction in non-plan expenditure over BE was also effected through reduction in capital expenditure and interest payments .
Both overall capital expenditure and capital outlay were lower than budgeted levels and also lower than last year ' s levels .
This has potentially adverse implications for growth in the medium term .
Union Budget 2015-16 has carried forward the process of fiscal consolidation , with all the key deficit indicators projected to decline ( Table II.11 ) .
The targeted reduction in GFD is proposed to be attained by a compression in revenue expenditure combined with an increase in non-debt capital recipients .
The goalpost for achieving the GFD-GDP target of 3.0 per cent under the FRBM Act / Rules has been shifted by a year to 2017-18 mainly to accommodate higher public investment to support growth , and higher devolution to the states following the recommendations of 14th Finance Commission as also accounting for uncertainties associated with the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) and the likely burden of the 7th Pay Commission award .
With an expected growth of 16.4 per cent in gross tax revenue , the ratio of gross tax revenue to GDP is estimated to improve by 0.4 percentage points to 10.3 per cent in 2015-16 .
The net tax revenue accruing to the Centre is , however , budgeted significantly lower at 6.5 per cent of GDP - down from 7.2 per cent in 2014-15 ( PA ) due to higher devolution to the states following the 14th Finance Commission award .
The implied tax buoyancy for gross tax revenue is significantly higher than the realised buoyancy of less than 1 in the previous two years ( Table II.12 ) .
Further , the projected increase of 18.9 per cent in indirect taxes as against 9.8 per cent realised in 2014-15 ( PA ) assumes a buoyancy of about 2 for service tax on the back of a hike in the service tax rate ( inclusive of education cess ) by 1.64 per cent , pruning of the Negative List under service tax and withdrawal of certain other exemptions to widen the tax base .
The projected buoyancy of 1.73 in the case of excise duty collections is mainly supported by ad hoc hikes in excise duty on petrol and diesel in 2014-15 , increase in excise duty on select products , such as mobile handsets and cigarettes , imposition of excise duty on hitherto untaxed items like condensed milk and peanut butter , and a general increase in excise duty to 12.5 per cent from the prevailing 12.36 per cent .
While these measures will facilitate meeting budgeted targets for indirect tax collections in 2015-16 , it is crucial to adhere to the timeline for the rollout of GST for a sustainable increase in tax revenues in the medium term .
Non-tax revenue , which includes dividends from public sector undertakings ( PSUs ) , the Reserve Bank , PSU banks and spectrum charges , is budgeted to grow at 12.6 per cent in 2015-16 .
Disinvestment proceeds are budgeted higher at ₹ 410 billion , with an additional inflow of ₹ 285 billion estimated out of strategic disinvestments .
The projected increase of about 179 per cent in disinvestment receipts , despite a track record to the contrary in terms of actual realisation , poses possible risks to overall budgetary targets for 2015-16 .
Buoyancies are worked out with respect to overall GDP growth rate .
The Centre ' s total expenditure is budgeted to increase by 8.1 per cent in 2015-16 ( BE ) with revenue expenditure declining as a proportion to GDP .
Capital expenditure is budgeted to increase sharply , reflecting the projected high growth in non- defence capital outlay .
Plan expenditure is expected to increase marginally in 2015-16 reflecting higher capital expenditure .
In the non-plan expenditure , subsidies are budgeted to decline on account of around 48 per cent cut in petroleum subsidy following a sharp fall in international crude prices and the deregulation of the retail sale of diesel that was undertaken in 2014 .
Food subsidies are budgeted to increase at a modest pace , while fertiliser subsidies are expected to decline .
Overall , the Government ' s plan for fiscal consolidation in 2015-16 through re-orientation of public expenditure in favour of investment rather than subsidies is a welcome move towards improving the quality of fiscal adjustment ( Box II.5 ) .
In the aftermath of the global financial crisis , government finances deteriorated significantly across the world as fiscal stimulus measures were introduced to reinvigorate the growth process and kick-start national economies worldwide .
Both advanced and emerging market economies have embarked on fiscal consolidation since 2010 , although the speed and extent of consolidation has been country-specific .
In India , fiscal consolidation resumed from the second half of 2012-13 , bringing about a steady decline in the centre ' s gross fiscal deficit ( GFD ) from 5.8 per cent of GDP in 2011-12 to 4.0 per cent in 2014-15 ( PA ) .
Notwithstanding such improvement , the quality of fiscal adjustment has remained a cause for concern .
Ideally , a fiscal consolidation strategy should be a mix of rationalisation of expenditure and revenue augmentation so that the welfare burden of consolidation is fairly distributed across society .
Apart from obvious steps like reducing government consumption and unproductive expenditure , such as subsidies , a consolidation process must deploy freed-up resources in higher public investment and / or more social spending via transfers to the poor .
This will induce medium term growth that can compensate the near-term decline in output .
Adjustments must necessarily be accompanied by structural reforms to enhance productivity and a credible fiscal consolidation roadmap that will anchor market expectations ( Tapsoba 2013 ) .
Fiscal consolidation in India has primarily been effected through aggressive cut-backs in expenditure , both on the revenue and capital accounts due to non-realisation of budgeted non-debt receipts .
As a result , the onus of fiscal consolidation has disproportionately fallen on expenditure compression .
In the process , certain productive expenditures under the central plan suffered cuts in excess of 20 per cent over budget estimates during 2012-13 to 2014-15 ( RE ) .
These include irrigation and flood control , communications , rural development and education .
Plan capital expenditure suffered a Shortfall of 14.4 per cent , on an average , during this period .
Fiscal rectitude based on cutbacks in capital expenditure has adverse effects on sustainable growth since the multiplier effects of capital expenditure are found to be larger and more prolonged than those of revenue expenditure ( Jain and Kumar 2013 ) . Union Budget 2015-16 has envisaged a reorientation of government expenditure with capital expenditure budgeted to grow at 29.1 per cent , while expenditure on subsidies is projected to undergo a decline ( Chart 1 ) .
This re-prioritisation of government expenditure along with the other initiatives discussed in Section II.1 of this Chapter is expected to facilitate pick up in investment in the economy .
While this is indicative of an improvement in the quality of expenditure , it is imperative that budgeted targets are converted into actual realisation .
In the past three years , the government has been effecting a cut of about 19 per cent in the actual capital outlay over budgeted levels in view of revenue shortfall .
Food subsidy is budgeted to increase modestly in 2015-16 , despite the proposed expansion in coverage under the National Food Security Act .
Capping the food subsidy within the budgeted level will involve a multi-pronged strategy : end-to-end computerisation of the public distribution system , decentralisation of procurement and distribution of food grains and improving the operational efficiency of the Food Corporation of India ( FCl ) .
A comprehensive fiscal consolidation strategy will also need sustainable improvement in government revenue .

As per the latest available information , the key deficit indicators of the Central Government , viz . , GFD and RD , as percentages to their budget estimates ( BE ) , were lower during April-June 2015 than in the corresponding period of the previous year .
Despite higher total expenditure , robust non- debt receipts resulted in lower GFD during this period .
Higher collections under all categories of indirect taxes and higher non-tax revenue provided a boost to the Central Government ' s receipts .
While outgo on major subsidies was lower , capital expenditure was higher on account of higher growth in plan capital expenditure . On July 31 , 2015 , the Government has approved additional provision of ₹ 255 billion sought through the first batch of Supplementary Demand for Grants for 2015-16 to meet capitalisation of public sector banks , support for social sector and rural development , additional support for metro rail projects , energy sector , civil aviation , culture and tourism and home affairs .
States ' Fiscal Position in 2015-16
The consolidated position of state finances indicates an increase in the GFD-GDP ratio to 2.9 percent in 2014-15 ( RE ) from 2.2 per cent in 2013- 14 , mainly due to an increase in aggregate expenditure which offset the increase in revenue receipts .
The capital outlay ratio increased by 0.7 percentage points of GDP in 2014-15 over the previous year ' s level .
The revenue balance continued to be in deficit at 0.1 per cent of GDP .
The BE for 2015-16 projects a decline in the GFD-GDP ratio to 2.3 per cent and turnaround in revenue account from a deficit to a surplus mode , indicating the states ' intention to intensify the process of fiscal consolidation ( Chart II.32 ) .
Improvement in the fiscal position is budgeted through buoyancy in tax revenues and containment of expenditure .
Expenditure patterns of the states indicate stagnancy in committed and non- development expenditure and a decline in development expenditure .
The fiscal position of the general government deteriorated in 2014-15 ( RE ) .
The combined fiscal deficit stood at 6.9 per cent of GDP as against 6.6 per cent in 2013-14 .
The decline in the Central Government ' s GFD by 0.3 percentage points was more than offset by a 0.7 percentage points increase in the GFD of state governments .
Union Budget 2015-16 was formulated with the two-fold objective of promoting growth through stepping up investment and strengthening the federal structure .
Accordingly , the fiscal strategy during 2015-16 is focused on creating space for infrastructure spending through a mix of own resources as well as a Sharp increase in investments by central public sector enterprises and a substantial increase in resource transfer to the states .
While the increased devolution to the states will constrain the Central Government ' s finances , it will help the States design , implementand finance programmes according to their specific needs .
However , with an increase in the fiscal autonomy of the states , it will be crucial for them to effectively invest their resources .
An aggregative analysis tends to disguise significant differences across states in terms of fiscal position and policies .
In this regard , the Reserve Bank ' s annual publication titled ' State Finances : A Study of Budgets of 2014-15 ' provides an in-depth analysis of state finances ata disaggregated level .
Global developments impacted India ' s external sector significantly in 2014-15 .
Export performance remained resilient to the commodity price plunge and large movements in G3 exchange rates for the greater part of the year .
However , the conjunction of weak global demand , decline in crude prices affecting exports of petroleum products ( POL ) and persisting real appreciation of rupee , eventually took its toll , resulting in export contraction in the last four months of the year .
With import prices falling faster than export prices , however , unexpected terms of trade gains accrued .
Imports of gold remained subdued until the liberalisation of restrictions prompted a surge in volumes in the later part of the year .
The combination of these factors restrained the current account deficit within sustainable limits .
Consequently , the external financing requirement was comfortably met and there was large accretion to the reserves .
India ' s merchandise exports fell below the target set by the government for the third successive year ( Chart II.33 ) ; the modest rise in volumes was eroded by a decline in unit value realisations .
Merchandise export growth in US dollar terms held up well in Q1 of 2014-15 , but gradually lost momentum in Q2 and Q3 , followed by a decline of about 16 per cent in Q4 - the sharpest contraction since Q2 of 2009-10 at the height of the global financial crisis .
Export contraction was steeper in Q1 of 2015-16 , though the downward drift was Slower in July 2015 .
Amongst the major sectors , petroleum products , oil meals , electronic goods , iron ore and gems & jewellery dragged down the overall export performance in 2014-15 ( Chart ॥ .34 ) .While the fall in exports of petroleum products reflected the softening of international crude oil prices in the last three quarters of 2014-15 , weakness in demand for other commodity classes interacted with domestic supply constraints related to infrastructure and other inputs to hit non-oil exports .
Destination- wise , exports to China , the EU , Singapore , Japan and Saudi Arabia suffered a larger set back in 2014- 15 .
Given greater trade integration , India ' s trade seems to have become increasingly responsive to global economic and financial conditions ( Box II.6 ) .
The plunge in global prices of crude oil by nearly 50 per cent between June 2014 and March go 2015 compressed India ' s POL import bill by 16 per cent yielding a saving of US $ 26.5 billion in relation 1 to the outgo on this account a year ago .
Global crude oil prices stayed modest in Q1 of 2015-16 ( Chart ॥ .35 ) .
The uptick in gold imports in the later part of 2014-15 could largely be attributed to festival demand , permission to trading houses to import gold for domestic consumption as well as the withdrawal of the 20 : 80 scheme and other restrictions for gold imports .
Not only has India diversified its exports in terms of destinations , but its participation in global value chains ( GVCs ) has also increased over the years , albeit at a lower level than other peer economies ( Chart 1 ) , particularly in chemicals and electrical equipment ( OECD 2014 ) .
Participation in GVC allows domestic firms to enter markets by specialising in niche intermediate activities within a chain and enables suppliers to upgrade production into higher- value segments of their industries .
This enhances comparative advantages , productivity growth and development levels in economies .
Greater cross-border linkages through GVCs also tend to increase the sensitivity of trade to external business cycle shocks ( Gangnes et al . 2014 ) .
Since the world is gradually transitioning to a stage in which GVC trade is assuming more importance than it did before , there appears to have been a long-run increase in the elasticity of global trade with respect to world economic activity ( Escaith et al.2010 ) .
In this context , estimation of country-specific trade elasticities assumes importance , especially in an international environment in which competitive monetary policy stances and exchange rate effects have implications for export competitiveness .
For India , the size of real exchange rate elasticity of real non-oil exports is estimated to be in the range of 0.7 to 0.9 with a lag of less than one year , while the income elasticity of real non-oil exports is 2.1 to 2.7 ( Jain and Tewari . 2014 ) .
Similarly , the volume of imports is found to be predominantly responsive to domestic demand while its elasticity with respect to the real exchange rate is broadly in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 .
The estimates of income and exchange rate elasticities are broadly in line with other studies undertaken for India ( Table 1 ) .
Overall , there appears to be support for the Marshall-Lerner condition implying the efficacy of exchange rate changes in moving the trade balance to the desired level .
In order to improve trade linkages with the rest of the world , India ' s participation in GVC must improve .
Policy focus should be concentrated on cluster development in particular sectors with large presence of MSMEs so that they can integrate effectively in the global production network .
Another way for domestic firms to integrate into GVC is through a joint venture or strategic partnership to achieve synergy gains .
Cross-border foreign investments should be encouraged .
While inward FDI benefits domestic firms in terms of capital , technology transfer and research and development ( R & D ) capabilities , outward FDI increases their productivity by providing access to scarce raw materials , a skilled labour force and expanding production networks .
Firms also need to specialise in logistics , design , assembly and R & D.
Thus , further policy attention is warranted to support in-house R & D so as to enable domestic firms to achieve quality standards and specialise in high value added activities .
There is ample scope for improvement in the quality and efficiency of services ( for example , basic infrastructure and air transport ) which will help India raise its share in GVC .
Given the sensitivity of India ' s trade to income conditions and exchange rate changes , policymakers need to be cognizant of external shocks especially through capital flows and domestic inflation and productivity levels as they may have significant implications for real effective exchange rate movements which eventually impact India ' s trade balance .

On May 13 , 2013 , the Reserve Bank restricted the import of gold by banks on a consignment basis to meet the genuine needs of exporters of gold jewellery , followed by the 20 : 80 scheme on July 22 , 2013 under which all nominated banks / agencies were to ensure that atleast one-fifth of every lot of import of gold was exclusively made available for the purpose of exports .
Effective May 21 , 2014 , nominated banks / agencies / premier or star trading houses / special economic zone units / export-oriented units were permitted gold imports under the 20 : 80 scheme .
While the gold metal loan scheme was also restored in May 2014 , the 20 : 80 scheme was withdrawn in November 2014 .
Further , imports on a consignment basis were also restored .
Further , sharp increase in gold imports in March and April 2015 also reflected suppressed demand in preceding months in anticipation of a cut in customs duty in Union Budget 2015-16 and demand surge on account of Akshaya Trithiya .
After being subdued , gold imports again spiked in the month of July 2015 , as gold prices dipped to the lowest level in last four years , stimulating domestic consumption demand ( Chart II.36 ) .
Non-oil non-gold imports picked up modestly in 2014-15 largely in response to domestic requirements of industry ( Chart II.37 ) .
Higher imports of iron and steel , iron ore , coal , non-ferrous metals , chemicals and machinery also resulted from shortfalls in domestic production in certain sectors .
In particular , the rise in coal imports reflected higher requirements of power companies which have added capacity to meet growing domestic demand for power .
Import of vegetable oils was also driven by shortages in domestic production .
Non-oil non-gold imports increased in the current financial year up to July 2015 , though at a modest pace .
With the decline in exports exceeding the fall in imports , the merchandise trade deficit widened marginally in 2014-15 from its level in 2013-14 .
While softening of oil prices compressed India ' s POL trade deficit , the non-POL trade deficit widened from US $ 34.2 billion in 2013-14 to US $ 55.7 billion in 2014-15 ( Table II.13 ) .
However , the trade deficit at US $ 45.0 billion during first four months ( April-July ) of 2015-16 was lower than that in the same period of 2014-15 .
The merchandise trade deficit ( BoP basis ) was partly offset by a rise in net exports of services .
Aided by better growth in the US , higher technology adoption and the strength of the US dollar against the rupee , India ' s software exports seemed to have benefitted , though appreciation of the rupee against the euro and sluggish demand might have dampened software exports to the euro area .
Net exports of travel services recorded a decline largely due to higher payments on account of personal services availed for education , medical reasons and holidays .
Notwithstanding the fall in international oil prices , the flow of remittances remained stable .
India ' s current account deficit ( CAD ) shrank to 1.3 percent of GDP in 2014-15 from 1.7 per cent a year ago .
Holding the CAD ata sustainable level going forward will hinge on a turnaround in merchandise exports .
This will also involve assigning priority to unlocking domestic supply-side bottlenecks in terms of infrastructure and other key inputs , including through active policy interventions to restore productivity and competitiveness across a broad spectrum of leading sectors ( Box II.7 ) .
On April 1 , 2015 , the Ministry of Commerce and Industry announced the Foreign Trade Policy 2015-20 ( FTP ) with a vision to making India a significant participant in world trade by 2020 and to enable the country to assume a leadership position in the international trade discourse .
FTP links rules , procedures and incentives for exports and imports with other initiatives ( for example , Make in India , Digital India and Skill India ) with a view to improving ' ease of doing business ' in India .
The salient features of FTP are : e To increase India ' s exports of merchandise and services from US $ 465.9 billion in 2013-14 to US $ 900 billion by 2019-20 and to raise India ' s share in world exports from 2 per cent to 3.5 per cent during this period .
A new scheme , the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme ( MEIS ) aimed at the simplification of the incentive structure , replacing multiple schemes is in place .
A new scheme , the Services Exports from India Scheme ( SEIS ) with expanded scope is in place , which will benefit all ' service providers located in India ' instead of only ' Indian service providers ' .
Allowing transferability and greater flexibility in using ' duty credit scrips ' which exporters will get under MEIS and SEIS .
Prioritisation of sectors which have domestic manufacturing capabilities and potential demand ( for example , drugs and pharmaceuticals , chemicals and electronics ) where exports need to grow significantly to achieve overall growth targets .
Other sectors identified with great export potential include engineering , leather , textiles , medical devices , natural resource based items , gems and jewellery , agri products and defence equipment .
Adoption of the ' whole-of- government ' approach as a significant step towards better coordination with state governments / other departments .
Indication of the revival of the interest subvention scheme for exports from identified sectors for a period of three years , though sectoral coverage and rate of interest Subvention are not indicated .
Envisages a move towards paperless working in a 24x7 environment to facilitate the ease of doing business in India .
Under the new FTP , the government has expanded the scope of the new schemes to special economic zones ( SEZs ) .
During 2014-15 , India became a preferred destination for private capital flows , which responded to improved perceptions of fundamentals , optimism engendered by a stable government at the centre and expectations surrounding resurgence of business sentiment in an improved climate for investors , both foreign and domestic .
The abundance of global liquidity in view of unconventional monetary policies in advanced economies also emerged as a push factor driving a relentless search for returns .
Foreign portfolio investors brought in about US $ 41 billion to Indian equity and debt markets , making India the most attractive destination among emerging markets .
Further , net foreign direct investment ( FDI ) inflows picked up strongly in response to initiatives that are geared towards a better business environment with policy certainty .
In particular , policy measures have been undertaken with regard to easing of norms for FDI in certain sectors , allocation of natural resources , the subsidy regime , financial inclusion , employment and job creation for the youth and an improved and non- adversarial tax administration .
FDI inflows to India , excluding disinvestments , were the highest after 2008-09 ( Chart ॥ .39 ) .
FDI mainly flowed into the manufacturing sector responding to the government ' s ' Make in India ' initiative , followed by financial services , retail and wholesale trade .
Within the manufacturing sector , transport equipment and chemical sectors were the major recipients and accounted for about 50 per cent of the total FDI in 2014-15 .
Inflows to NRI deposits and in the form of external commercial borrowings were moderate during 2014-15 relative to the preceding year , signifying policy induced inflows in the past .
With net capital inflows exceeding CAD sizeably , there was net accretion to reserves to the tune of US $ 61.4 billion on a BoP basis ( that is , excluding valuation effects ) .
External vulnerability indicators improved Significantly in 2014-15 on account of both a lower accretion to the external debt stock and the build-up of foreign exchange reserves .
Key debt and reserve-related indicators of external vulnerabilities reflected an improved ability to discharge external obligations .
The Indian rupee , however , depreciated only marginally against the US dollar ; therefore , by the same token , it gained strongly against other major currencies , viz . , euro , GBP and Japanese yen , reflecting the weak economic outlook for these economies and their ultra-accommodative monetary policies .
Reflecting persisting inflation differentials and appreciation of the rupee in nominal terms vis-a-vis India ' s major trade partners , the real effective exchange rate of the rupee during 2014-15 , on average , appreciated by 6.1 per cent and by 5.5 per cent ( y-o-y ) for the basket of 6 and 36 currencies respectively .
The rupee exchange rate also witnessed lower volatility in 2014-15 and 2015-16 So far than in the earlier period ( Chart II.40 ) .
Going forward , external sector sustainability will need close monitoring , especially in a global environment characterised by high volatility in financial markets , asynchronicity in monetary policies of major advanced economies and in particular , the widely expected lift-off of US interest rates , and still high geo-political risks .
Although international crude oil prices stayed at modest levels in Q1 of 2015-16 and dropped sharply in August 2015 due to excess supply and subdued demand , continuation of benign conditions for the remaining part of the year still remains uncertain .
For India , every US $ 1 increase in international crude prices broadly translates into an increase in the net POL import bill by US $ 1 billion .
Third , key to ensuring the viability of the external sector in this backdrop is a renewed thrust on exports in terms of both products and markets .
Export diversification has provided a means of insulation in the face of sluggish global economic conditions and this should be vigorously pursued to strengthen resilience and to minimise the spillovers of external shocks .
During 2014-15 , a formal architecture for FIT based on an agreement between the Reserve Bank and the Government of India pertaining to the monetary policy framework was put in place .
The liquidity management framework was revised to bring in proactive liquidity operations based on variable rate term repo / reverse repo auctions to align the weighted average call rate , that is , the operating target around the policy rate .
With ebbing inflationary pressures , receding risks to the inflation outlook and commitments to fiscal prudence , the Reserve Bank eased its monetary policy stance with a cumulative 75 bps cut in the policy repo rate during January- August 2015 .
These are the first building blocks of its medium-term vision of ensuring price stability on a durable basis as a necessary pre-condition for fostering higher economic growth .
There was a fundamental change in the conduct of monetary policy in 2014-15 .
Several institutional and operational innovations were put in place in the preceding year to enable this regime shift based on the recommendations of the Expert Committee to Revise and Strengthen the Monetary Policy Framework .
These included improved communication by means of bi-monthly policy reviews ; introduction of term repos to offset the reduction in access to liquidity through overnight fixed rate repo under the liquidity adjustment facility ( LAF ) ; and the adoption of headline consumer price index ( CPI ) inflation as the nominal anchor for the conduct of monetary policy .
Set against this backdrop , managing the transition to a flexible inflation targeting ( FIT ) framework in a non- disruptive manner in 2014-15 became a key challenge .
Ensuring disinflation consistent with the glide path announced in January 2014 required maintaining an anti-inflationary monetary policy stance till upside risks to the inflation outlook had been contained .
Greater transparency on monetary policy necessitated release of Monetary Policy Reports ( MPRs ) .
Sector specific refinance facilities were phased out to create conditions for more effective transmission of monetary policy .
A new liquidity management framework had to be put in place to ensure market-based liquidity operations through auctions , while striving to ensure consistency of liquidity conditions with the stance of monetary policy .
Besides forward looking surveys , the need to strengthen technical research through forecasting and policy analysis models in order to facilitate decision making under uncertainty also assumed significance .
The Reserve Bank had set out a formal framework to guide monetary policy operations in 2014-15 .
First , in January 2014 , it announced a disinflationary glide path for bringing down CPI inflation to below 8 per cent by January 2015 and to below 6 per cent by January 2016 .
Second , in September 2014 , the Reserve Bank introduced a revised liquidity management framework that brought flexibility and transparency to liquidity management operations , while aiming at strengthening transmission in the money market by anchoring the weighted average call rate ( WACR ) ator closely aligned to the repo rate .
Third , a landmark agreement was signed between the Government of India and the Reserve Bank in February 2015 that provided the formal architecture for conducting monetary policy operations consistent with FIT and related institutional and accountability processes .
In response to the upside risks to inflation stemming from the impact of a sub-normal monsoon on food prices and still elevated international crude oil prices , the policy rate was kept unchanged in Q1 of 2014-15 .
The disinflationary effects of rate increases undertaken during September 2013-January 2014 were transmitted through the economy , tempering inflationary pressures .
Concerns about tepid economic activity nevertheless required the commencement of a process of gradual reduction in the statutory liquidity ratio ( SLR ) to give banks more freedom to expand credit to productive sectors .
Besides temporary base effects pulling down headline inflation , international commodity prices , particularly of crude oil ( Indian basket ) , declined sharply by about 57 per cent between June 2014 and January 2015 , aiding the disinflationary momentum .
Furthermore , there were indications of a more durable downward movement in headline inflation driven by transport and communication and household requisites , suggesting that prices of non-tradables were responding to policy impulses .
Awaiting a clearer assessment of the balance of risks and the durability of disinflation , the policy rate was kept unchanged during Q2 and Q3 .
Inflation for January 2015 turned out to be nearly 300 basis points ( bps ) below the target of 8 per cent .
Moreover , by January 2015 , there was increasing evidence of a robust disinflationary process having taken hold .
For instance , household inflation expectations three months ahead as well as one year ahead eased to a single digit for the first time since September 2009 .
On January 15 , 2015 , the policy repo rate was reduced by 25 bps to 7.75 per cent .
Further , monetary policy actions were made contingent on on-going evidence about continuing disinflationary momentum and sustenance of high quality fiscal consolidation .
The new CPI re-based to 2012 , which was released on February 12 , 2015 , confirmed that strong disinflationary impulses were underway in the economy .
The pre-conditions for effecting a change in the monetary policy stance materialised in quick succession with inflation ebbing and the Union Budget for 2015-16 suggesting a tangible progress on fiscal consolidation for 2014-15 alongside a renewed medium-term commitment about fiscal rectitude .
Consistent with the forward guidance , the Reserve Bank announced a cut in the repo rate outside the normal policy review cycles to 7.50 per cent in March 2015 .
The first bi-monthly policy statement for 2015-16 announced on April 7 , 2015 noted that the stance of monetary policy going forward would centre around a gradual and durable disinflation , taking headline CPI inflation to 6 per cent by January 2016 and to 4 per cent by the end of 2017-18 .
The identified upside risks included the possibility of a sub-normal monsoon , large deviations from their seasonal patterns in vegetable and fruit prices , larger than anticipated administered price revisions , faster closing of the output gap , geo-political risks causing hardening of global commodity prices and external spillovers through the exchange rate and asset price channels .
Downsides originating from global deflationary / disinflationary tendencies , the benign outlook on global commodity prices and slack in the domestic economy appeared to ameliorate upside risks .
Accordingly , key policy rates were kept unchanged , pending expected transmission of past policy rate reductions to lending rates by banks .
Therefore , while awaiting further data for greater clarity on the risks in meeting the medium term disinflation targets , a cut in the policy repo rate by 25 bps was front-loaded , taking it to 7.25 per cent .
Taking into account the developments in 2015-16 thus far and the balance of risks as also the front-loaded policy action of June , the third bi-monthly policy on August 4 , 2015 kept the policy rate unchanged , while maintaining the accommodative stance of monetary policy .
The statement noted that the short-term real risk free rates were supportive of borrowing by interest rate sensitive consumer segments such as housing and automobiles and as greater transmission of front- loaded past actions was awaited , developments would be monitored for emerging room for more accommodation .
The operating framework of monetary policy provides clarity on how the objectives of monetary policy respond to changes in policy rate - the repo rate .
The link from the policy rate to inflation target requires a systematic and stable transmission path linking the policy rate , the operating target , an intermediate target and a transparent set of rules guiding liquidity and monetary operations ona day- to-day basis ( see Box IV.I in MPR of April 2015 ) .
Liquidity management is key to aligning the operating target of monetary policy to the policy rate and is thus critical for the first leg of monetary transmission .
In India , currently the WACR is the operating target of monetary policy .
Recognising the long and variable lags in transmission of monetary policy , inflation forecasts - or the projected baseline inflation path - are used as the intermediate target .
This makes monetary policy proactive and forward looking .
In line with the recommendations of the Expert Committee , Q3 of 2014-15 saw the implementation of a revised liquidity management framework aimed at making liquidity management operations flexible , transparent and predictable .
The revised liquidity management framework has the following features : ( i ) Subject to availability of excess SLR securities , assured access to central bank liquidity of 1 per cent of banks ' net demand and time liabilities ( NDTL ) comprising 0.25 per cent provided through overnight fixed rate repo auctions conducted daily , and 0.75 per cent provided through 14-day variable rate term repo auctions conducted on every Tuesday and Friday ; ( ii ) fine-tuning operations through variable rate repo / reverse repo auctions of maturities ranging from overnight to 28 days ; ( iii ) outright open market operations to manage enduring liquidity mismatches ; and ( iv ) overnight marginal standing facility ( MSF ) up to excess SLR plus 2 per cent below SLR of individual banks .
The revised framework has necessitated a more proactive approach to liquidity management by the Reserve Bank , that is , assessing the system level expected liquidity mismatch on a daily / intra- day basis , providing more information to the market to enable precision in liquidity planning and proactive assuaging of frictional and structural liquidity mismatches .
Since introduction of the revised framework , WACR has moved close to the repo rate , indicative of growing precision in monetary policy operations .
The Expert Committee had recognised that in India developing market-based benchmarks could enable pricing of deposits and loans to be sensitive to changes in the policy repo rate , thereby facilitating monetary transmission .
Regular auctions of 14-day term repos ( twice a week ) allow market participants to use the primary liquidity for longer durations .
This flexibility is intended to facilitate the emergence of a market-based term money benchmark .
The spread between 14-day term repo rate and the overnight fixed repo rate has narrowed significantly after the introduction of the revised liquidity management framework , barring the year-end spikes ( Chart III.2 ) .
This process is intended to be taken forward by the establishment of transparent external benchmarks , based on the marginal cost pricing principle ( see para III.31 ) .
The liquidity framework was tested in March 2015 as liquidity tightened due to accumulation of cash balances of the government and banks with the Reserve Bank peaking at the end of the financial year on balance sheet and year-end considerations .
In April 2015 , these balances reversed , declining significantly and creating surplus liquidity conditions in the inter-bank market .
The Reserve Bank managed these alternating but large movements in liquidity through 7-day , 2 / 3-day and overnight reverse repo auctions to fine-tune liquidity .
Since mid-April , the liquidity requirement of the system has moved in a narrower range of around 1 per cent of NDTL , which has been managed through additional variable rate overnight and term repos / reverse repos .
With the increase in spending by the government , liquidity conditions improved significantly in June and July .
The Reserve Bank absorbed the excess liquidity through the variable rate reverse repo auctions of varying terms .
Besides , the Reserve Bank also absorbed the excess liquidity to the tune of ₹ 82.7 billion through OMO sales conducted on July 14 , 2015 .
On February 20 , 2015 , the Government of India and the Reserve Bank signed an agreement on the Monetary Policy Framework .
The agreement represents a fundamental institutional reform in India as it mandates the Reserve Bank to pursue FIT with transparency , predictability and accountability .
The government ' s commitment to the agreement also enhances the credibility of the framework , bringing confidence about the process of fiscal consolidation and supply management , both of which are highly relevant for maintaining price stability .
In pursuance of the recommendations of the Expert Committee , the first issue of the MPR was released along with the fourth bi-monthly monetary policy statement in September 2014 , providing a medium-term outlook and the balance of risks around a variety of potential shocks .
With the publication of MPR , India joins a select band of countries that lay emphasis on transparency and forward looking communication to ensure public understanding and accountability of monetary policy formulation and operations ( Box Ill.1 ) .
Forward guidance provided in the fifth bi- monthly policy statement in December 2014 indicated the possible commencement of an easing cycle by early 2015 if the disinflationary process moved along the expected trajectory , coupled with evidence of softening inflationary expectations , quality and quantity of fiscal consolidation , steps to augment supply of key inputs and unlocking of Stalled investments so as to revive the economy more generally . Policy rate reductions , in January , March and June 2015 were consistent with this guidance .
This requires an effective communication strategy between the central bank and the public .
A core element of this communication strategy is that of providing forecasts of inflation , an analysis underpinning these forecasts and the rationale embedded in the policy decisions taken by the central bank .
Thus , a high degree of transparency embodied in high quality reports is often considered essential for establishing and maintaining the credibility of the framework ( Svensson 2002 ) .
Consequently , inflation targeting central banks typically publish a regular Inflation or Monetary Policy Report ( MPR ) with the aim of making monetary policy transparent , comprehensible and predictable , and hence , credible as far as possible ( Table 1 ) .
In fact , transparency and communication has become a sine qua non for effective and successful conduct of monetary policy in recent years ; even non-IT central banks such as the Federal Reserve now communicate through an MPR .
In India , based on the recommendations of the Expert Committee , the monetary policy framework began a phased transition to a flexible inflation targeting ( FIT ) framework from the first bi-monthly monetary policy statement in April 2014 .
The first report after the agreement was published as the second MPR in April 2015 .
As with other IT countries , the endeavour is to make MPR a prominent communication tool to bring about transparency and credibility in the conduct of monetary policy in India .
The MPR brings out the assessment of the Reserve Bank ' s staff on the macroeconomic outlook based on a forward looking assessment and on model-based forecasts along with baseline assumptions and balance of risks , which form the basis for its monetary policy stance .
The report also carries a detailed assessment of economic and financial conditions which inform the overall macroeconomic outlook .

Policy rate reductions , in January , March and June 2015 were consistent with this guidance .
The transmission of monetary policy is typically characterised by long , variable and uncertain time lags with asymmetric market responses to policy impulses in terms of magnitude and / or direction across segments in different phases of liquidity conditions .
Furthermore , the transmission of policy rate changes to deposit and lending rates of banks is lagged and less complete relative to money market rates , reflecting the presence of structural rigidities in the credit market ( Table III.1 ) .
Therefore , improving the efficacy of monetary policy impulses to their fullest effect remains incomplete even as some degree of pass through of rate reductions in the recent period has been translated into lending rates .
The Reserve Bank announced a number of initiatives and measures during the year to incentivise banks to improve transmission at their end .
Progress in this direction is expected to be seen going forward .
* * : Data are till Aug 14 , 2015 .
@ : CRR was cut to create the desirable liquidity conditions ahead of the repo rate cuts in the next easing phase .

WALR : Weighted average lending rate .

( ii ) Data on WALR are provisional .
WADTDR : Weighted average domestic term deposit rate .
Note : Data on WADTDR and WALR are provisional .
The decline in deposit rates was , however , not fully reflected in the weighted average lending rates ( WALR ) of banks , indicating their efforts to maintain net interest margins ( NIMs ) in an environment characterised by weak credit demand and risk aversion amidst rising non-performing loans ( NPAs ) .
The WALR on fresh rupee loans sanctioned by banks declined by 51 bps to 11.08 per cent since the first round of reduction in the repo rate ( Table III.2 ) .
WALR on outstanding rupee loans , however , declined by only 17 bps during the same period as the interest rates on loans disbursed earlier are reset with a time lag .
While the response of commercial banks to a reduction in the policy rate by 75 bps is still unfolding , the movement of lending rates across various sectors is uneven , presumably reflecting the differential risk assessment of banks ( Table III.3 ) .
The base rate system introduced in 2010 has been an improvement over the benchmark prime lending rate ( BPLR ) system , disallowing sanctioning of a large proportion of the loans at sub-prime rates .
Banks are free to determine their lending rates based on cost of funds or any other relevant market based benchmark .
Base rates have converged to a narrow range of 9.70-10.15 percent for public sector banks ( PSBs ) .
Table III.3 : Weighted Average Lending Rates of ( Excluding RRBs ) * - Select Sectors ( at which 60 per cent or more business is contracted )
As highlighted in the Report of the Expert Committee , the sluggish transmission to credit markets reflects the interaction of several factors .
The major factors impeding transmission include rigidities in re-pricing for fixed deposits , high volume of government borrowing , practice of yearly resetting of administered interest rates on small savings ( including public provident fund ) linked to G-sec yields , interest rate subventions , high level of NPAs and a significant presence of informal finance .
There could also be risks emanating from a possible migration of deposits to alternative financial assets , as well as physical savings yielding higher expected real rates of return .
Further , in the calculation of the base rate , the repo rate does not enter directly , operating only through the costs of wholesale funding which are sensitive to changes in the repo rate .
In an easing phase , banks tweak the spread over the base rate while pricing loans instead of changing the base rate itself .
This is an opaque practice that leads to discrimination among new and old borrowers .
The issue was highlighted by the Working Group on Pricing of Credit and accordingly in January 2015 , banks were allowed greater operational flexibility to price credit with the freedom to revise the methodology every three years instead of every five years as was done earlier .
Moreover , to address the issue of arbitrary charging of spread , banks were advised : ( a ) to have a board-approved policy , delineating the components of spread charged to a customer ; and ( b ) to ensure that the spread charged to an existing borrower ( other than a consortium and multiple banking arrangements ) does not increase , except on account of deterioration in the credit risk profile of the customer or change in the tenor premium .
Going forward , these measures are expected to improve transparency and fairness in the credit pricing framework in India .
In its first bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2015-16 announced on April 7 , 2015 , the Reserve Bank stated that the base rate calculated on the basis of a marginal cost of funds should be more sensitive to changes in policy rate .
In order to improve the efficiency of monetary policy transmission , the Reserve Bank will encourage banks to move to a marginal cost-of-funds-based determination of their base rates .
Once the Financial Benchmark India Pvt. Ltd . , an independent benchmark administrator , starts publishing various indices of market interest rates , the Reserve Bank will encourage banks to use the indices as an external benchmark for pricing bank products .
The Reserve Bank ' s growth and inflation projections are prepared under considerable uncertainty and shifting balance of risks .
While common assumptions ( covering some of the key determinants of inflation and growth ) are used to generate the baseline projected paths , upside / downside risks and the resultant likely deviations of the inflation and growth paths from the baseline are presented as part of the assessment of balance of risks in the MPRs .
The actual inflation path during Q4 of 2014- 15 turned out to be significantly below what was indicated in the September 2014 MPR in view of the large changes in underlying conditions which were widely unanticipated .
Two major factors , inter alia , necessitated this revision .
First , in February 2015 , the CSO updated the all India CPI-Combined series base from 2010 = 100 to 2012 = 100 .
As per CSO , inflation on an average in 2014 in the new series was 50 bps lower than what was recorded in the old series .
The divergence varied from ( + ) 0.04 to ( - ) 1.11 percentage points in different months .
Second , crude prices registered a sharp fall between September 2014 and January 2015 and , on an average , crude oil prices were 36 per cent lower than what was considered as part of the baseline assumptions in the MPR of September 2014 .
The release of the new series on national accounts by the CSO in January 2015 was another major exogenous shock to the Reserve Bank ' s projections .
Growth projection for 2014-15 was retained unchanged at 5.5 per cent since January 2014 till the revised national accounts numbers were released by the CSO in January / February 2015 .
The stronger than anticipated growth momentum in the CSO data ( new base ) relative to the data as per the old base was the key factor behind the deviation of the Reserve Bank ' s projected output growth for 2014-15 from CSO ' s estimates .
The Reserve Bank is continuously engaged in refining and modernising its analysis and forecasting capacities so as to improve precision and Stability .
These efforts notwithstanding , improving projection performance in the face of major data revisions and large magnitudes of supply / external shocks will remain a key challenge for forward looking conduct of monetary policy .
The monetary policy framework of the Reserve Bank aims at anchoring inflation expectations as close as possible to the target .
During 2014-15 , anchoring expectations , especially breaking the rigidities that had set in from the experience of 2009-13 turned out to be a major challenge .
The coverage of items in the two price indices - CPI-C and WPI - is different .
The weight of food in the CPI-C basket is higher at about 46 per cent , as against about 24 per cent in WPI .
Nearly a quarter of CPI-C is composed of services whereas this component is not covered in WPI .
CPI-C , therefore , is the most representative of available measures of price indices in India .
The decline in WPI in the last 9 months has been driven by the sharp fall in global commodity prices , including crude petroleum and industrial raw materials , such as metals and chemicals .
Generally , divergent inflation trends as per different price indices do not persist for long .
Even if such divergences persist , anchoring the expectations of all agents in the economy as per the CPI-C inflation target will be important , even though divergent trends may entail differential welfare effects on different sections of the population depending on their own consumption baskets and range of inputs used in the production processes .
Modern day monetary policy operating frameworks focus on price stability under dynamic liquidity and financial conditions .
Macro-financial linkages can , however , change significantly , and the conduct of monetary policy should recognise this and respond in a timely manner .
An assessment of the natural real rate of interest assumes critical importance in this context under the explicit recognition that it is not static and may vary over time .
Model-based estimates of natural real interest rate for India in Q4 of 2014-15 suggest a range of 0.6 per cent to 3.1 per cent , with + / - one standard error of about 50 bps ( Box III.2 ) .
There were , however , some challenges that were not fully addressed during 2014-15 .
The natural rate of interest propounded by Wicksell ( 1898 ) has become a standard reference point in assessing the monetary policy stance of central banks since the 1990s , particularly after the growing popularity of flexible inflation targeting ( FIT ) and the use of Taylor type interest rate rules .
While it was originally conceptualised as an equilibrium real rate at which desired saving equals desired investment , in its modern day formulation it is equated with the real rate of interest that is consistent with a zero output gap and inflation stable around its target over the business cycle .
In any Taylor rule type assessment of a monetary policy stance , the natural real interest rate is often assumed as constant , even though in reality it may vary over time in response to supply and demand side shocks , which could be large and persistent .
Trend changes in productivity , population growth and households ' time preference in terms of consumption and saving decisions over their life cycle have been the conventional determinants of the natural real interest rate .
The global saving glut that preceded the global financial crisis had already imparted a significant downward pressure to global natural real interest rates .
After the global crisis , the collapse of investment demand and subsequent deleveraging by corporations and households seem to have amplified the downward pressure on natural real interest rates in advanced economies ( AEs ) .
Estimates for the US economy suggest that the natural real interest rate which declined from about 3.5 per cent in 1990 to about 2 per cent in 2007 , fell sharply to zero over the recession years of 2008 and 2009 , and since then remained near zero for five years up to 2014 ( Williams 2015 ) .
Secular stagnation is widely believed to keep the natural real interest rate near zero in the medium-run .
In India there has been a significant fall in total factor productivity after the global crisis which is a major structural factor pushing down the natural real interest rate .
The sharp deceleration in the annual rate of increase in gross fixed capital formation over the six-year period 2009-10 to 2014- 15 relative to the pre-crisis phase of high growth reflects the change in time preference of entrepreneurs , that is , to wait and delay new investment projects in the midst of elevated uncertainty .
Favourable demography and the associated shift in the pattern of demand for credit and saving behaviour over life-time to smooth consumption could also alter the natural rate .
When so many factors potentially alter the natural rate , the time varying natural rate for India , estimated using the Kalman filter ( Laubach and Williams 2003 ) , has moved in the range of 0.5 per cent to 4 per cent over time , and seems to have declined since 2010 gradually to about 2 per cent now ( Chart 1 ) .
The estimation of the natural rate of interest is highly sensitive to the underlying model , choice of variables , assumptions used for approximating potential output , the representative measure of inflation expectations and even the inflation target ( that is , 6 per cent vis-a-vis 4 per cent ) .
Alternative estimates of the risk free natural real interest rate accordingly suggest a range of 0.6 per cent to 3.1 per cent for Q4 of 2014-15 .
Uncertainty about the true value of the natural rate is a challenge for the conduct of monetary policy .
Laubach , Thomas and John C. Williams ( 2003 ) , ' Measuring the Natural rate of Interest ' , Review of Economics and Statistics , 85 ( 4 ) , November .
Third , the transmission of repo rate cut to deposit and lending rates remained incomplete , and credit growth continued to be sluggish in an easing cycle of monetary policy .
Besides the several factors mentioned earlier and the various steps taken by the Reserve Bank , the lower share of wholesale funding of banks in India has also partly hampered effective transmission of the policy rate to deposit and lending rates .
Bank funding in India has a preponderance of retail deposits / savings that inhibits a seamless moderation in the cost of funds in response to reductions in the policy rate .
The new liquidity management framework contributed to lower volatility in money market rates while allowing these rates to be determined through market forces in response to policy repo rate signals and day-to-day normal and fine-tuning liquidity operations .
Two macro models were institutionalised for generating forecasts and scenario analyses , and the publication of two bi- annual MPRs contributed to strengthening communication with enhanced transparency on key aspects of the forward looking new monetary policy framework .
Going forward , the focus of the Reserve Bank ' s monetary policy stance during 2015-16 will be on fostering a gradual and durable disinflationary process towards the target of below 6 per cent by January 2016 in order to achieve the centrally projected rate of 4 per cent by the end of 2017-18 .
At the same time , the efficacy of the monetary policy transmission mechanism needs to improve since the pass-through of recent cuts in policy rate to the bank lending rate has been partial , reflecting constraints in transmission under the existing base rate system .
Identifying the impediments in pass- through and implementing an alternative method , such as marginal cost based credit pricing or identifying an appropriate benchmark for the bank lending rate will be a priority for the Reserve Bank .
In this regard , it is imperative to develop market based benchmarks by developing the term segment of the money market .
Thus , liquidity support may have to be progressively provided through regular auctions of longer term repos with reduced dependence on overnight fixed-rate liquidity support .
While doing so , it will also be important to dampen deviations of WACR and other money market rates such as CBLO rates from the repo rate in a narrow range .
The Reserve Bank will continue to explore and augmentits instruments of liquidity management , including standing deposit facility for absorption of surplus liquidity , as recommended by the Expert Committee .
The Reserve Bank kept up its efforts to ensure universal access to banking services throughout the country and improving credit delivery during the year . Apart from continued emphasis on enhancement of credit to agriculture , the major thrust during the year was on improving availability of credit to the micro , small and medium enterprises to help the sector realise its full potential .
The launch of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana ( PMJDY ) provided an added impetus to the various initiatives undertaken by the Reserve Bank towards furthering financial inclusion and financial literacy .
Over the years , the credit delivery system has been scaled up and expanded with innovations that reach out to the diverse financing needs of society .
More recently , the effort has been to spread the economies of scale and scope and experience gained in urban and semi-urban areas to geographical regions and sections of society that asymmetric credit markets tend to exclude in view of their lack of pricing power .
In 2014-15 , the focus was on improving the availability of credit to micro , small and medium enterprises ( MSMEs ) , revising priority sector guidelines to foster greater inclusiveness and enhancing the flow of credit to agriculture .
In line with this , the Financial Inclusion and Development Department ( FIDD ) being the nodal department for financial inclusion focused on creating an enabling environment for providing universal access to banking services throughout the country and ensuring timely and smooth flow of credit to the priority sectors of the economy with a view to developing an efficient and inclusive financial system .
Guided by its core objective of fostering greater inclusiveness , the Reserve Bank ' s endeavour during the year was to continue its efforts to ensure extension of banking facilities to all unbanked villages and make financial inclusion a viable proposition for banks to improve credit delivery .
Under the on-going Phase-ll of the roadmap for financial inclusion , which envisages opening of banking outlets in all unbanked villages with population less than 2,000 , the strategy included identifying unbanked villages and allotting such villages to banks for coverage .
To address the need for aligning priority sector lending guidelines with national priorities , the Reserve Bank constituted an Internal Working Group to revisit the guidelines .
In pursuance of its developmental role , the Reserve Bank accords priority to efficient and comprehensive credit delivery , particularly to priority sectors comprising primarily of the agricultural and MSME sectors , and the weaker sections of society .
The guidelines on priority sector lending were revised during the year with a view to widening the scope of the sector and improving the flow of credit .
Financial inclusion efforts received a big fillip with the launch of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana ( PMJDY ) coupled with synchronised efforts by the Reserve Bank .
To simplify credit dispensation , the need to submit ' no due certificates ' to scheduled commercial banks by individual borrowers , including self help groups ( SHGs ) and joint liability groups ( JLGs ) for all types of loans , irrespective of the amount involved , was discontinued .
Innovative steps to provide support to MSMEs like guidelines for introduction of a mechanism to address the issue of delayed payment in the form of a technology enabled Trade Receivables Discounting System ( TReDS ) , conducting research on matters relating to MSMEs , design and conduct of training programmes for the MSME division-in-charges and trainers in commercial banks were initiated during the year .
Additionally , MSME divisions were opened by regional offices of the Reserve Bank to focus on issues concerning lending to the sector in their respective jurisdictions .
Priority sector refers to those sectors of the economy which , though viable and creditworthy , may not get timely and adequate credit in the absence of a special dispensation .
Typically , priority sector loans are small value loans to farmers for agriculture and allied activities , micro and small enterprises , poor people for housing , students for education , other low income groups and weaker sections .
Priority sector lending needs to be extended by banks as part of their normal business operations and should not be viewed as corporate social responsibility .
The data for 2015 are provisional .
With the intention of giving a thrust to the MSME sector , medium enterprises were brought in the ambit of the priority sector .
Additionally , a specific target was introduced for lending to micro enterprises .
In addition to medium enterprises , two new categories , viz . , social infrastructure and renewable energy were included under the priority sector ( Box IV.1 ) .
The buyer ( a deficient bank ) will pay a ' price / fee ' to the seller bank ( a bank which has over achieved its PSL requirements ) for purchasing a specified amount of PSL obligation applicable for a particular date .
Educational loans ( including loans for vocational courses ) up to ₹ 1 million irrespective of the sanctioned amount to be considered as eligible for the priority sector .
Export credit up to 32 per cent of adjusted net bank credit ( ANBC ) or credit equivalent amount of off-balance sheet exposure ( CEOBE ) , whichever is higher , to be eligible as part of the priority sector for foreign banks with less than 20 branches .
Led by the performance of scheduled commercial banks ( SCBs ) , the actual flow of credit to the agriculture sector has been consistently higher than the target in recent years .
Co-operative banks and regional rural banks ( RRBs ) , however , could not achieve their targets for 2013-14 and 2014-15 ( Table IV.2 ) .
SCBs ' non-performing assets ( NPAs ) in the agriculture sector have been rising steadily since 2010 , reflecting , inter alia , a decline in the recovery of agriculture advances ( Tables IV.3 and IV.4 ) .
For domestic and foreign banks with 20 branches and above , the incremental export credit over the corresponding date of the preceding year will be reckoned up to 2 per cent of ANBC or CEOBE ( whichever is higher ) , as part of the priority sector .
Foreign banks with less than 20 branches are required to achieve the total priority sector target of 40 per cent of ANBC or CEOBE , whichever is higher , in a phased manner by 2020 .
Reflecting the focus of the Government and the Reserve Bank on enhancing credit flow to the MSE sector , credit to the sector showed a growth of 13.6 per cent as compared to the overall bank credit growth of 9.0 per cent during 2014-15 ( Table IV.5 ) .
Continuing its efforts of promoting financial inclusion in the MSME sector , the Reserve Bank launched several initiatives during the year to address impediments in the credit flow to the sector .
As part of capacity building of MSME divisions in banks and to develop entrepreneurial sensitivity , the Reserve Bank ' s College of Agricultural Banking ( CAB ) , Pune has designed training programmes for the MSME division-in-charges and trainers in commercial banks .
Source : Scheduled commercial banks .
CAB , Pune has also developed a syllabus for the regional offices of the Reserve Bank , which , in turn , will conduct workshops for capacity building for branch managers of specialised MSME branches in their jurisdictions .
The Reserve Bank continued with its efforts to ensure extension of banking facilities to all unbanked villages .
For this , about 490,000 unbanked villages with population less than 2,000 were identified and allotted to banks for coverage under the ongoing Phase-II of the roadmap .
At end- March 2015 , as reported by State Level Bankers Committees ( SLBCs ) , 390,387 villages were covered by 14,207 branches , 357,856 business correspondents ( BCs ) and 18,324 other modes , such as automated teller machines ( ATMs ) and mobile vans .
The major features of the scheme include : ( i ) the facility to open a basic saving bank deposit ( BSBD ) account in any bank branch or BC outlet ; ( ii ) accidental insurance cover ( ₹ 0.1 million ) and life insurance cover ( ₹ 30,000 ) ; and ( iii ) an overdraft ( OD ) facility after satisfactory operation of the account for six months .
Since the inception of the scheme , 165.7 million accounts had been opened by June 30 , 2015 .
The Government of India has initiated routing of subsidy payments and also introduced insurance and pension products for BSBD account holders including for those accounts opened under PMJDY .
Out of 3,445 rural bank branches opened during 2014-15 , 2,230 branches were opened in unbanked rural centres .
Around 155 million basic savings bank deposit accounts ( BSBDAs ) were added taking the total BSBDAs to 398 million .
This includes 147 million accounts opened under PMJDY .
Other dignitaries who attended the conference included the Governor of Maharashtra , the Finance Minister of India and the Chief Minister of Maharashtra , apart from experts from the banking and finance fraternity .
The Prime Minister released the Concise History of Reserve Bank of India : 1935-1981 at the function .
The Prime Minister encouraged the Reserve Bank to prepare a roadmap for achieving financial inclusion objectives by setting targets in a phased manner till the centenary year of the establishment of the Reserve Bank .
Panel discussions were held on the following topics as part of the conference : ( i ) ' Financial Inclusion - Let All Efforts Bloom ' ; ( ii ) ' Building the Business Case for Financial Inclusion - Whether BC Model is the Way to Go ?
( iii ) ' Financial Inclusion - the Way Forward ' ; and ( iv ) ' The linkage between Financial Inclusion , Financial Literacy and Consumer Protection ' .
Some of the key points which emerged from the discussions are : Concerted efforts of the Government of India , the Reserve Bank and banks are necessary to further the financial inclusion agenda .
The strategy to realise this goal will comprise of a mix of conducive policy environment , use of innovative channels / technology and optimal utilisation of the BC model .
The risks associated with the BC model can be mitigated by putting in place a secure system , use of appropriate technology , effective supervision , efficient cash management services and capacity building .
Raising the level of acceptance of technology by customers will require sustained financial literacy initiatives on the part of bankers .
Customers ' awareness about their rights and duties is integral to developing a conducive consumer protection environment .
This will also necessitate banks to develop strong internal grievance redressal mechanisms .
Financial Inclusion Plan-Summary Progress of All Banks Including RRBs
This is possible if all government payments are routed through the banking channel .
A step ahead will be to remunerate banks appropriately for routing these transactions through the banking channel .
In addition , since the last mile delivery of all banking services is expected to be done mostly through the large BC network created across the country , it is necessary to ensure that appropriate control system for oversight over BC operations is provided by banks .
The success of the Information and Communication Technology based BC model critically depends upon the availability of proper network connectivity across the country .
SCBs have been advised to dispense with no due certificate from individual borrowers ( including SHGs and JLGs ) for all types of loans , irrespective of the amount involved .
Banks have been encouraged to use an alternative framework of due diligence for credit appraisal , which could consist of one or more of the following : ( i ) credit history check through credit information companies ; ( ii ) self-declaration or an affidavit from the borrower ; ( iii ) central registry of securitisation asset reconstruction and security interest ( CERSAI ) registration ; ( iv ) peer monitoring ; ( v ) information sharing among lenders ; and ( vi ) information search ( writing to other lenders with an auto deadline ) .
Apart from direct initiatives , the Reserve Bank ' s efforts to expand financial literacy are channelled through banks .
In terms of current instructions , financial literacy centres ( FLCs ) and rural branches of banks are required to conduct financial literacy camps atleast once a month with focus on financially excluded people .
Additionally , banks are encouraged to conduct such camps in unbanked locations .
As at end March 2015 , 1,181 FLCs were operational in the country , up from 942 as at end March 2014 .
During the period April 2014 to March 2015 , financial literacy camps were conducted by 32,509 rural branches of banks and 1.4 million and 5.7 million participants opened accounts in the camps organised by the FLCs and rural branches of banks , respectively ( Table IV.7 and IV.8 ) .
This will provide banks with an instrument to aid them in priority sector target achievement and allow leveraging of their comparative advantage in lending to the priority sector .
Studies will be conducted to assess the efficacy of existing schemes on lead bank , credit guarantee trust for micro and small enterprises ( CGTMSE ) , KCC , SHG - bank linkage and the BC model .
Operationalisation of TReDS , which has been conceptualised as an authorised electronic platform to facilitate discounting of invoices / bills of exchange of MSMEs , will be taken up during the course of the year .
In pursuance of the objective of fostering a conducive policy environment for the MSME sector , there will be continuous monitoring of banks ' efforts towards nursing and rehabilitation of MSME units , collation and analysis of data on credit flow and sickness in such units .
With a view to developing ' entrepreneurial sensitivity ' and improving the skills of dealing functionaries of banks , the Reserve Bank proposes to roll out a national capacity building programme .
This is expected to help the functionaries understand the genuine credit needs of MSME entrepreneurs and provide timely response .
During 2014-15 , the Reserve Bank undertook several measures to improve the financial markets .
The efforts were targeted at increasing participation , simplifying procedures and making the markets deeper , efficient , accessible and stable .
In the money market , the endeavour was to further develop term / repo markets .
In the government securities ( G-secs ) market , the objective , as in the past , was to promote liquidity and broad based participation , including by foreign investors and resident individuals .
In the foreign exchange market , emphasis was placed on the liberalisation of transactions , both current and capital and inward and outward .
In the derivatives segment , the objective was to develop participation through simplification of procedures .
FMRD was set up on November 3 , 2014 with a mandate to regulate , develop and oversee financial markets in an integrated manner .
The primary activities of the department include regulation and development of the money , G-secs , foreign exchange and related derivatives markets .
The department is also responsible for the implementation of the recommendations of the Committee on Financial Benchmarks ( Chairman : Shri P. Vijaya Bhaskar ) , strengthening of the financial market infrastructure and market surveillance .
A Market Intelligence Cell is proposed to be set up as part of FMRD .
Going forward , the department will focus on ( i ) making market access norms easier for all participants ; ( ii ) expanding the menu of products and participants across all segments ; ( iii ) strengthening market infrastructure in line with global standards ; and ( iv ) leveraging the market analytics and surveillance mechanism for policy inputs .
During 2014-15 , FMRD undertook measures targeted at increasing participation , simplifying procedures and making the markets more efficient .
With the objective of implementing the recommendations of Committee on Financial Benchmarks , a new company , Financial Benchmarks India Pvt Ltd ( FBIL ) , jointly promoted by the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India ( FIMMDA ) , the Foreign Exchange Dealers ' Association of India ( FEDAI ) and the Indian Banks ' Association ( IBA ) , has commenced operations in February 2015 .
As a first step , FBIL overnight Mumbai interbank offer rate ( FBIL-Overnight MIBOR ) was launched on July 22 , 2015 .
CCIL has , accordingly , started disseminating data on USD- INR forwards and USD-INR currency options with effect from April 13 , 2015 . The data disseminating are on an aggregated basis and contain tenor-wise traded rate / implied volatility in terms of open , high , low , last , weighted average rate ( WAR ) , volumes and number of trades ( Box V.1 ) .
The reforms include improving transparency and enhancing the resilience of OTC derivatives markets .
An implementation group for OTC derivatives ( Chairman : Shri R. Gandhi ) , constituted on the direction of the sub-committee of the Financial Stability and Development Council ( FSDC ) has set out a roadmap for reforms .
Following the standardisation of inter-bank trades in credit default swaps ( CDS ) and the rupee overnight index swap ( OIS ) based on overnight MIBOR , interest rate swaps ( IRS ) referenced to other benchmarks will be standardised in phases .
Standardisation of foreign exchange derivatives will be addressed at the end of 2015 since they are generally ' plain vanilla ' and market liquidity is low in currency swaps , IRS in foreign currency ( FCY ) and interest rate options .
As the market develops for forex options , currency swaps ( CS ) , FCY-IRS and interest rate options in FCY and CDS , the possibility of introducing a trading platform will be examined .
As in the case of all OTC forex and interest rate derivatives , client transactions in rupee IRS / forward rate agreement ( FRA ) and CDS , FCY interest rate options will be brought under the reporting framework but as and when its liquidity picks up .
Thus , India has become fully compliant with the G20 commitment on reporting of OTC derivatives transactions to TRs .
More than 80 per cent of IRS trades are being centrally cleared on a non-guaranteed basis without a regulatory mandate .
In principle approval has been given to CCIL to provide central counterparty ( CCP ) based clearing for IRS trades which will be made operational shortly .
CCP clearing for forex options , CS , IRS and interest rate options in FCY and CDS in which liquidity remains low will be reviewed by end-2015 .
Detailed modalities for OTC derivatives , including CDS will be prescribed taking into account the recommendation of the Basel Working Group on margin requirements and other international developments .
Rules on capital requirements for banks ' exposures to CCPs have been made effective from January 1 , 2014 , reducing the capital requirements for centrally cleared products .
In addition , credit valuation adjustment ( CVA ) capital charge for non-centrally cleared derivatives has also been made effective .
Facilitating participation of foreign portfolio investors ( FPIs ) in G-secs was one of the key mandates for the year .
In this direction , FPls were permitted to acquire G-secs directly from any counterparty in the secondary market , obviating the requirement of a broker .
Settlement of all FPI transactions in G-secs has been permitted on T + 2 basis .
FPls were allowed to reinvest coupons , received on their investments in G-secs , outside the existing limit and also permitted to hedge the currency risk of the coupon receipts on debt securities falling due during the following 12 months .
With the objective of introducing new products and expanding markets , 6-year and 13- year cash settled interest rate futures ( IRFs ) on Government of India ( Gol ) securities with residual maturity of 4-8 years and 11-15 years , respectively , were permitted on exchanges .
To make documentation in forex markets less onerous , the certification required from the hedging entity ' s statutory auditors has been replaced with an undertaking from the designated officials of the entity , both in the OTC and the exchange traded currency derivatives ( ETCD ) markets .
The eligibility limits for hedging for importers , based on past performance , have been brought at par with exporters , both in the OTC and ETCD markets .
The permissible position limits on the exchanges , without the requirement of establishing underlying exposure , have been enhanced to US $ 15 million for USD-INR and US $ 5 million for all other permitted currency pairs put together .
Towards achieving the objective of providing overseas entities greater access to onshore hedging markets , external commercial borrowings ( ECBs ) lenders in rupees have been permitted to enter into swap transactions with their overseas bank which shall , in turn , enter into a back-to-back swap transaction with any authorised dealers ( AD ) category-I bank in India .
In order to improve transparency and broad base participation in interest rate swaps ( IRS ) , an anonymous electronic trading platform for IRS contracts referenced to overnight MIBOR benchmark was launched on August 3 , 2015 with the CCIL ' s guaranteed settlement .
In respect of a few areas identified for implementation , while action has been initiated , full implementation is yet to be achieved .
Examining the feasibility of international settlements for Indian sovereign debt securities was another planned activity .
There has been continuous engagement with the Gol and the major international central security depositories ( ICSD ) , Euroclear and Clearstream , in this regard .
A feasible mechanism addressing all concerns is likely to become operational during 2015-16 .
The regime for fixing limits for FPI investment in debt securities has undergone changes over the years .
The Reserve Bank , in consultation with the Gol , intends to put in place a structured process for fixing these limits along with a framework for periodic reviews .
To enable seamless movement of securities from the subsidiary general ledger ( SGL ) form to the demat form and vice versa , it was announced to provide demat account holders a functionality to put through trades on NDS-OM .
An implementation group with representatives from all stakeholders has been set up to roll out the measures by December 2015 .
A deep and liquid corporate bond market has been a shared policy goal of the Gol and financial regulators .
Introduction of an electronic platform for facilitating repo in corporate bonds will be considered for implementation .
In order to impart liquidity to the options segment in the OTC forex market and attract greater all-round participation , final guidelines allowing exporters and importers to write covered options against their contracted exposures are expected to be issued shortly .
Based on the recommendations of the Working Group on interest rate options , the final guidelines will be issued .
A framework for assessment of benchmark Submission practices by market participants will also be put in place in 2015-16 .
As part of organisational restructuring , FMOD was created from the erstwhile Financial Markets Department ( FMD ) on November 3 , 2014 by hiving off the surveillance function .
The role of FMOD is to facilitate vibrant , efficient and stable financial markets to support a rapidly growing real economy .
FMOD is primarily entrusted with the task of conducting market operations in consonance with the policies of the Reserve Bank .
Thus , as in the previous years , maintaining orderly conditions in the forex market through its operations in both spot and forward segments was high on the agenda for 2014-15 .
The department also intends to undertake technological up-gradation to facilitate smoother and more flexible liquidity management operations .
With increasing globalisation , and evolving business practices and models , effective integration of the needs of both residents and non-residents is necessary while meeting the basic objectives of the Foreign Exchange Management Act ( FEMA ) , 1999 .
Since India is likely to remain a capital deficit country in the near to medium term , the regulatory regime needs to provide a framework which is simple , comprehensive and principle based so as to reduce the regulatory cost and improve the ease of doing business .
This has to be implemented within the overarching principle of calibrated progress towards capital account liberalisation within the constraints imposed by macro-prudential Stability .
Within the Reserve Bank , FED acts as the nodal department for this purpose .
In 2014-15 , efforts were directed at further simplifying the foreign investment regime and making it more user-friendly both for domestic firms and foreign investors .
A review of the existing framework of the ECBs was also envisaged .
On a review of the policy on eligible instruments for foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and FPI , partly paid equity shares and warrants issued by an Indian company were allowed to be considered as eligible instruments for the purpose of FDI and FPI schemes .
To provide greater freedom and flexibility in the FDI framework , the issue and transfer of shares , including compulsorily convertible preference shares / debentures , with or without optionality clauses ( without any assured return ) , was allowed to be carried out at a price worked out as per the guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) in case of listed companies and any internationally accepted pricing methodology in case of unlisted companies on an arm ' s length basis .
Further , Indian companies were permitted to issue equity shares against any funds payable by them , remittances of which did not require prior permission of the government or the Reserve Bank under FEMA , 1999 or any rules / regulations framed or directions issued thereunder .
AD category-I banks were permitted to allow pledge of equity shares of an Indian company held by non-resident investor / s in accordance with the FDI policy in favour of non- banking financial companies ( NBFCs ) to secure credit facilities extended to the resident investee company .
Following the changes announced by the Government in the FDI policy , regulations were amended to enable foreign investments : ( a ) up to 49 per cent in the defence sector under the government approval route ; and ( b ) up to 100 per cent in railway infrastructure and manufacturing of medical devices under the automatic route .
In addition , FDI in the insurance sector was increased to 49 per cent from the earlier level of 26 per cent .
A new depository receipts scheme , 2014 was notified by the Reserve Bank on January 22 , 2015 , under which a person is eligible to issue or transfer eligible securities to a foreign depository for the purpose of converting the securities into depository receipts .
The scope of ECB was expanded and recognised non-resident lenders were allowed to extend loans in Indian rupees to eligible resident borrowers .
The facility , besides providing greater flexibility for structuring of ECB arrangements , shifts the currency risk from borrowers to lenders .
For better structuring of the draw-down of ECB proceeds and their subsequent utilisation for permitted end uses , eligible ECB borrowers were allowed to park ECB proceeds in term deposits with AD Category-I banks in India for a maximum period of six months , pending utilisation .
The set of eligible securities for raising ECBs was made more broad- based to include movable assets and financial securities in addition to immovable assets .
Policies relating to overseas direct investment ( ODI ) were liberalised with a view to providing flexibility to residents for availing fund based or non-fund based facilities for overseas joint ventures ( JVs ) , wholly owned subsidiaries ( WOS ) and step down subsidiaries ( SDS ) .
This , inter alia , included permitting pledging of shares of its overseas SDS and creating a charge on domestic / foreign assets .
In view of the resumption of buoyant capital inflows in the recent period and as part of macro- prudential management , the limit under the liberalised remittance scheme ( LRS ) was enhanced to US $ 2,50,000 per individual per financial year from the existing limit of US $ 1,25,000 .
Further , to ensure ease of transactions , all the facilities for release of exchange / remittances for current account transactions available to resident individuals under Schedule III of the Foreign Exchange Management ( Current Account Transactions ) Rules , 2000 , as amended from time to time , were subsumed under this limit .
To mitigate the hardships faced by people travelling to Nepal and Bhutan , individuals were permitted to carry higher value denomination notes up to a value of ₹ 25,000 .
Earlier , individuals travelling to these two countries were allowed to carry Indian currency without any limit in denominations of only up to ₹ 100 .
Regulations were framed in March 2015 to enable functioning of IFSCs under which a financial institution or a branch of a financial institution will be treated as a person resident outside India and its transactions with a person resident in India will be treated as those between a non-resident and a resident and subject to the provisions of FEMA , 1999 .
In the monetary policy statement of April 2015 , the Reserve Bank , in consultation with the Gol , decided to permit Indian corporates eligible to raise ECBs to issue rupee denominated bonds overseas .
The draft framework on overseas issuance of rupee linked bonds by multilateral financial institutions and eligible borrowers was placed in the public domain and the policy in this regard is likely to be finalised soon .
Considering the progress that the country has made in foreign exchange management and to facilitate the ease of doing business , there is a need for aligning the regulations issued under FEMA , 1999 with evolving business models and practices .
Accordingly , the Reserve Bank proposes to ( i ) complete the task of rationalising and simplifying the notifications issued under FEMA , which commenced last year ; ( ii ) issue master regulations covering all instructions on a subject in a more user friendly format ; and ( iii ) rationalise the returns submitted to it in order to reduce the regulatory load on users of foreign exchange .
The task of simplifying the ECB guidelines is an ongoing process and the Reserve Bank will also take into account the recommendations of the Committee to Review the Framework of Access to Domestic and Overseas Capital Markets ( Phase II , Part II : Foreign Currency Borrowing , Report lll ; Chairman : Shri M.S. Sahoo ) .
Encouraged by the stabilisation of EDPMS , the Reserve Bank will initiate work on installing an import data processing and monitoring system ( IDPMS ) in coordination with the government agencies .
Following the economic slowdown and sector-specific factors , the banking sector has been beset with the problem of deteriorating asset quality .
In response , the Reserve Bank focused on strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework to identify stress at the incipient stage and initiate corrective action .
Alongside , the Reserve Bank sought to infuse competition in the banking sector by allowing new private sector banks and differentiated banks .
Asset reconstruction companies were also encouraged for recovery management .
The year under review was marked by rising financial stability risks worldwide - uncertainty surrounding the normalisation of monetary policy in the US and market reactions to incoming data that prompted risk-on risk-off switches in sentiment , asset prices and capital flows around its timing ; highly accommodative monetary policies in the euro area and Japan with large swings in financial asset prices ; and financial rebalancing and managing domestic vulnerabilities in emerging market economies , higher corporate indebtedness and growing exposure to market and liquidity risks .
Against this backdrop , Safeguarding financial stability through well- designed macro-prudential measures addressing both banking and non-banking constituents of the financial system assumed critical importance .
With asset quality and profitability of banks coming under stress due to a combination of global and domestic developments , the Reserve Bank ' s focus during 2014-15 was on strengthening the regulatory and supervisory frameworks by aligning them with Basel III norms and also with those established by other international standard setting bodies .
The regulatory and supervisory regime for non-banking financial companies ( NBFCs ) and urban cooperative banks ( UCBs ) was also fortified by aligning it with that of the banking system while promoting technological upgradation and sharing credit histories of borrowers .
The banking structure itself was sought to be strengthened by infusion of new entrants , including in niche domains , such as small finance and payments banks and by extending the reach of the payment system infrastructure by bringing into its fold non-bank authorised entities .
The Reserve Bank also signed memoranda of understandings ( MoUs ) / exchange of letters / statements of cooperation with a host of Supervisors of other countries to promote greater cooperation and sharing of supervisory information relating to Indian banks with overseas operations and foreign banks operating in India .
A critical area in the banking space that warranted prioritised attention was the mounting overhang of stressed assets .
Besides mechanisms for early corrective actions , a multi-pronged Strategy was adopted comprising higher provisioning against restructured assets , recovery management through asset reconstruction companies and strategic debt restructuring .
Towards this end , various departments of the Reserve Bank dealing with the regulation and supervision of financial intermediaries as also customer interest set out for themselves an agenda of work plans in 2014-15 .
The following paragraphs outline the activities undertaken by them , the challenges faced and the way forward for 2015-16 .
In the aftermath of the global financial crisis , maintaining financial stability has emerged as a prime responsibility of central banks .
FSU of the Reserve Bank was set up in July 2009 to monitor stability related matters with the objective of strengthening the financial system .
This is envisaged to be achieved by conducting macro- prudential surveillance on an on-going basis , systemic stress tests and dissemination of the Status of financial stability in addition to supporting the institutional mechanism for financial stability in the country , viz . , Financial Stability and Development Council ( FSDC ) .
As planned for 2014-15 , two Financial Stability Reports ( FSRs ) were published - one in December 2014 and the other in June 2015 .
It is the endeavour of the Reserve Bank to bring about improvements to its stress testing framework .
Accordingly , refinements were made to the macro stress testing methodology with respect to the variables used ( e.g. , using the consumer price index ( CPI ) instead of the wholesale price index ( WPI ) , and weighted average lending rate in place of call rate ) .
In addition , FSU collaborated with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) in the areas of modelling risk weighted asset ( RWA ) dynamics and modelling corporate sector distress and its impact on the banking sector in order to make further refinements in the stress testing framework as also to develop new predictive models .
Analyses of power and iron and steel industries , with emphasis on stressed assets were undertaken .
Further , their impact on the banking sector was assessed to gauge the resilience of the banking system .
As the secretariat to the sub-committee of FSDC , FSU conducted three meetings of the sub- committee during 2014-15 .
The sub-committee ' s recommendation for putting in place an enabling framework for creating an ' account aggregation ' facility for customers to view all their financial assets through a single window , is being worked out .
Based on the discussions in the sub- committee , the Central Registry of Securitisation , Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest of India ( CERSAI ) will be acting as the central know your customer ( KYC ) registry to ensure both uniformity in the approach to KYC and its inter- usability across the financial sector .
Drawing on the sub-committee ' s recommendations , various steps have been taken to strengthen State Level Coordination Committees ( SLCCs ) to make them more effective in the dissemination of market intelligence on unauthorised deposit taking schemes .
Enactment of the Protection of Interests of Depositors ' ( PID ) Act has been undertaken across a number of States / union territories .
Based on the sub-committee ' s direction to capture information on lending by insurance companies to corporates , insurance companies were advised to subscribe to the Central Repository of Information on Large Credits ( CRILC ) , a repository of information on large credits set up by the Reserve Bank .
Further , FSU also serves as the secretariat for the inter-regulatory technical group ( IRTG ) , a sub-group of the FSDC sub-committee and in this Capacity it conducted four meetings during 2014- 15 , in which issues such as legal entity identifier ( LEI ) , reporting of lending against shares by NBFCs , account aggregation and common KYC , among others , were discussed .
The IRTG has advised all regulators to draw a road map to mandate use of LEI by entities identified in their jurisdiction .
Going ahead , conducting macro-prudential surveillance and publishing FSR in December 2015 and June 2016 are envisaged along with conducting meetings of the FSDC sub-committee .
FSU will continue to undertake analyses of some of the critical industrial sectors .
In addition , it is also proposed to collaborate with international agencies / other central banks to review the tools and techniques used for conducting stress tests .
Accordingly , the department initiated a number of measures in 2014-15 for strengthening the banking structure .
During 2014-15 , significant progress was made towards implementation of the two Basel III Liquidity Ratios - liquidity coverage ratio ( LCR ) which is set to impart resilience in the short term liquidity risk profile of banks , and the net stable funding ratio ( NSFR ) that seeks to limit over- reliance on short-term wholesale funding .
While LCR was phased in for Indian banks with a minimum requirement of 60 per cent from January 1 , 2015 , NSFR is set to be implemented at the minimum requirement of 100 per cent from January 1 , 2018 .
In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ( BCBS ) , the Reserve Bank issued a revised framework for LR in January 2015 as a credible supplement to risk-based capital requirements .
While the final minimum LR for Indian banks will be stipulated in line with the final rules to be prescribed by BCBS by end-2017 , the Reserve Bank will meanwhile monitor individual banks against an indicative LR of 4.5 per cent as part of a parallel run and also for the purpose of public disclosure of Tier 1 LR by banks .
Guidelines on implementation of CCCB in India have been issued covering aspects , such as constituents of CCCB , main and supplementary indicators to decide CCCB activation and calibration of CCCB based on indicators .
Implementation of this buffer requirement will be pre-announced with a lead time of four quarters so as to provide sufficient time to meet CCCB requirements .
In line with the global practice of identifying global systemically important banks ( G-SIBs ) , the Reserve Bank has released the framework for dealing with D-SIBs , which discusses the methodology for identifying D-SIBs and additional regulatory / supervisory policies for them .
The names of banks classified as D-SIBs will be disclosed in August every year starting from 2015 .
The danger of concentration of a bank ' s assets with a single counterparty or a group of connected counterparties poses a systemic risk .
During 2014-15 , ways to incentivise corporates to reduce dependence on bank finance for their long-term resource requirements were explored .
Pursuant to this , draft guidelines were issued to banks to provide partial credit enhancement to corporate bonds .
The final guidelines in this regard are underway .
Since 1989 , the Reserve Bank has been prescribing regulatory limits on a bank ' s exposures to its single and group borrowers .
At present , the exposure limits stand at 15 per cent and 40 per cent of capital funds ( CFs ) , respectively .
On account of exposures towards infrastructure sector and further on the special discretion of the board of a bank , these exposure limits can be taken up to 25 per cent and 55 per cent of its CFs , respectively .
Besides , there are certain other specific counterparty , sectoral and activity-based exposure limits ( Table 1 ) .
The Reserve Bank has sought to align exposure limits ( both single and group ) in India with the BCBS LE framework .
Further , exposures to the central government , the Reserve Bank , intra-day inter-bank exposures , intra-group exposures and clearing exposures of qualified central counterparties are exempt from the LE limit .
The LE Framework also prescribes differential exposure limits for certain counterparties , such as non-banking financial companies ( NBFCs ) and systemically important banks ( SIBs ) , both global and domestic ( G-SIBs and D-SIBs ) .
Towards greater alignment of prudential norms on project finance with international best practices banks were allowed to extend structured long-term project loans with tenors up to 80 per cent of the initial economic life of a project , with a periodic refinancing option to avoid asset liability mismatch , fund cost over-runs up to a limit and extend the date of commencement of commercial operations ( DCCO ) subsequent to the change in ownership of the borrowing entity .
These measures are expected to further strengthen banks ' abilities to deal with complexities in project finance .
Under SDR , secured creditors of a Joint Lenders ' Forum ( JLF ) can convert their loan dues into equity shares at a ' fair price ' as per the pricing formula prescribed by the Reserve Bank , which has been exempted from the SEBI ' s ICDR ( Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements ) Regulations , 2009 subject to certain conditions .
SDR will not be treated as restructuring for the purpose of asset classification and provisioning .
An internal study of the 20 largest group borrower exposures of the 10 largest banks has revealed that average exposure to groups of connected counterparties is 10.6 per cent of their CF as against the current permissible limit of 40 per cent of CF .
In terms of Tier 1 capital , the present average exposure is 14.75 per cent as against the proposed LE limit of 25 per cent .
Therefore , it is assumed that banks will not face any material difficulty with regard to their group exposures while adhering to the proposed LE limit .
In this regard , the proposal of a comprehensive Bankruptcy Code in the Union Budget , 2015-16 is expected to bring about speed , Clarity , predictability and fairness to the restructuring and recovery process ( Box V1.2 ) .
In its endeavour to foster healthy competition , the Reserve Bank laid out a framework for licensing new banks in the private sector in February 2013 .
Accordingly , in-principle approval was granted in April 2014 to IDFC Limited , an NBFC , and Bandhan Financial Services Private Limited , an NBFC-MFI ( micro- finance institution ) to set up banks .
The Union Budget 2015-16 identified bankruptcy law reforms as a key priority and proposed a comprehensive Bankruptcy Code in line with global standards to provide for necessary judicial capacity .
It is envisaged to bring about legal certainty , speed and also improve the ease of doing business .
At present , there is no comprehensive policy / law on corporate bankruptcy in India .
The Sick Industrial Companies ( Special Provisions ) Act ( SICA ) , 1985 remains to date the most important corporate restructuring law in force for revival and rehabilitation of sick companies , despite its well- recognised drawbacks .
Other legislative attempts to overhaul the corporate rescue regime in India have not yet been made operational .
For instance , Chapter XIX of the Companies Act , 2013 that provides for a broader , more balanced corporate rescue procedure applicable to all companies has not been notified for commencement .
Similarly , Chapter VIA of the Companies Act , 1956 , inserted by the Companies ( Second Amendment ) Act , 2002 , which provides for the National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ) to exercise powers in relation to sick industrial companies remains to be notified .
With a view to overcoming the existing inadequacies , the Bankruptcy Law Reform Committee ( BLRC ) ( Chairman : Shri TK Vishwanathan ) was established in August 2014 and entrusted with the task of examining the present legal framework for corporate insolvency and suggesting immediate reforms ; and developing an ' Insolvency Code ' for India covering all aspects of personal and business insolvency .
Unsecured creditors representing 25 per cent of the debt can initiate rescue proceedings against the debtor company .
Once a company has been declared sick , 75 per cent of the secured creditors in value should be able to appoint a company administrator directly .
Amendment to the Companies Act , 2013 so that at the time of sanctioning a scheme of revival creditors within the same class are treated equally ; and dissenting creditors receive as much as they would in liquidation .
An administrative mechanism for resolving financial distress of viable MSMEs through ' Committees for Distressed Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises ' to be established by banks by amending the Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act , 2006 .
However , in view of problems with an automatic moratorium under SICA , it is proposed to retain the present provisions in the Companies Act , 2013 , while stipulating clear principles regarding exercise of discretion by NCLT on grant of moratorium or not .
This will result in considerable improvement in the credit climate in the country .
Government of India ( 2015 ) , ' Interim Report of The Bankruptcy Law Reform Committee ' , Ministry of Finance .
The Reserve Bank received 72 and 41 applications for small finance banks and payments banks respectively ; these are under review .
So far , 11 applicants have been granted in-principle approval to set up payments banks .
Pursuant to the announcement of Government of India on setting up of an IFSC in Gujarat International Finance Tech-City ( GIFT ) , the Reserve Bank has formulated a scheme for setting up of IFSC banking units ( IBUs ) .
This scheme will provide the financial services entities in GIFT as well as other future IFSCs with a sound Supporting regulatory framework .
Further , the post of chairman and managing director ( CMD ) has been split into an executive managing director ( MD ) and a non- executive chairman .
The revamped process for appointment of non-executive chairmen on the boards of public sector banks ( PSBs ) has been initiated by the government .
KYC guidelines were revised in April 2014 to ease difficulties in opening and operating bank accounts .
Accordingly , the physical presence of a customer categorised as ' low risk ' is not mandatory at the time of KYC updation .
Fresh proof of identity and address is not required for ' low risk ' customers for updation in case of unaltered status .
Self- certification of proof is allowed and banks can accept a certified copy by mail / post ; and no fresh documents are required if an existing KYC compliant customer desires to open another account in the same bank .
Banks can now rely on third party due diligence at the time of account opening , provided the third party is regulated and supervised and has adequate measures in place for compliance with client due diligence .
If the accountis still KYC non-compliant after six months of ' partial freezing ' , banks may render it inoperative .
The account can be revived on submission of KYC documents .
Effective April 16 , 2015 , banks are allowed to offer differential rates of interest on term deposits on the basis of tenor and premature- withdrawal facility for deposits of less than ₹ 10 million and on the basis of quantum , tenor and premature-withdrawal facility for deposits of ₹ 10 million and above , subject to certain conditions .
However , all term deposits of individuals ( held singly or jointly ) of ₹ 1.5 million and below should , necessarily have premature withdrawal facility .
From April 1 , 2015 , banks are required to notify a customer by SMS / email / letter before applying penal charges for non-maintenance of minimum balance in the inoperative savings account .
Furthermore , penal charges have to be directly proportional to the extent of shortfall observed and levied after one month from the date of notice to a customer .
Detailed customer protection guidelines were issued to banks conducting insurance distribution activities , e.g. , ensuring customer Suitability while selling an insurance product only when the customer volunteers to purchase it , prohibiting payment of commission / incentive directly to the staff , transparency in disclosure of brokerage / fee earned from the insurer , adherence to KYC guidelines and requirement of having a robust grievance redressal mechanism .
In continuation of the stance that guided regulatory actions in 2014-15 , it is proposed to implement the final framework for the LE regime and for NSFR in the ensuing year .
Besides , the Reserve Bank will be issuing draft guidelines for consultation on counterparty credit risk exposures , Pillar 3 disclosures and the securitisation framework .
These regulations will reflect the revised BCBS norms in the respective areas .
The Reserve Bank will also be initiating Suitable measures towards convergence of accounting standards with the International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) .
In-principle approvals will be issued to suitable applicants for setting up of Small Finance Banks / Payments Banks while the regulatory framework for them will be formulated .
On the future of local area banks ( LABs ) , a consultation process will be initiated while draft guidelines for on tap licensing of universal banks will be framed .
Implementation of certain major recommendations of the Nayak Committee regarding governance reforms in PSBs , including remuneration and professionalisation of the boards will be taken forward .
For more effective monetary transmission , banks will be encouraged to move in a time-bound manner to a marginal cost of funds-based determination of their base rates .
It is further proposed to examine the current framework on presence of foreign banks in India in line with emerging international developments as well as the experience gained so far .
To add additional clarity , frequently asked questions ( FAQs ) will be issued on various aspects of the wholly owned subsidiary framework issued in November 2013 .
Guidelines will also be framed on ownership in private sector banks which will include raising the ceiling on voting rights from 10 to 15 per cent .
As UCBs play an important role in the Indian financial system , the Reserve Bank has always endeavoured to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework so that they emerge financially strong and have sound governance .
DCBR plays the lead role in framing regulations for UCBs apart from State Cooperative Banks ( StCBs ) and District Central Cooperative Banks ( DCCBs ) .
The agenda of DCBR for 2014-15 focused on putting in place a revised supervisory action framework , pursuing legal / regulatory amendments to facilitate conversion of UCBs into commercial banks and also to facilitate takeover of assets and liabilities of UCBs by commercial banks .
Accordingly , a revised supervisory action framework was put in place in 2014-15 .
As regards legal amendments to facilitate conversion of UCBs into commercial banks , while the Companies Act , 2013 has enabling provisions there is need for corresponding provisions in the Multi State Cooperative Societies Act , which have been taken up with the government .
With regard to commercial banks taking over assets and liabilities of UCBs , necessary tweaking of the regulations was accomplished during the year .
This enables commercial banks to complete the effort on a fair price basis .
Cash reserve ratio ( CRR ) requirements for non-scheduled UCBs and statutory liquidity ratio ( SLR ) requirements for all UCBs have been aligned with those of commercial banks following the Banking Laws ( Amendment ) Act , 2012 coming into force .
Accordingly , UCBs were required to comply with the stipulated SLR by March 31 , 2015 .
On a review , they have been allowed to shift their SLR term deposits to approved securities in phases by March 31 , 2017 .
Implementation of CBS has been prescribed as an additional criterion for being considered as financially sound and well managed ( FSWM ) bank , a criterion applied for extending various regulatory approvals to UCBs , including opening new branches .
In order to bring in transparency and objectivity , ' regulatory comfort ' , an important aspect considered for classifying a bank as FSWM , has been redefined to include compliance with standard regulatory provisions during the last two financial years .
FSWM UCBs are allowed to offer internet banking ( view only ) facilities to their customers provided they have migrated to the Internet Protocol Version 6 ( IPv6 ) .
They can also open on- Site / off-site / mobile automated teller machines ( ATMs ) without prior approval of the Reserve Bank provided they have a minimum net worth of ₹ 0.5 billion .
Similarly , with a view to providing greater freedom to StCBs to expand their business and to provide technology-enabled services to their customers , StCBs can also open off-site / mobile ATMs without prior approval of the Reserve Bank Subject to certain prescribed criteria .
As indicated in the last Annual Report , trigger points necessitating supervisory / regulatory action have been revised for UCBs for early identification of stress and its rectification .
UCBs are required to go for corrective action if the gross non-performing assets ( NPAs ) to advances ratio exceeds 10 per cent or they experience an incremental gross NPA ratio of 3 percentage points each during the last two consecutive years , whichever is earlier .
Other triggers for corrective actions include regulatory capital falling below 9 percent , incurring losses for two consecutive years and the credit deposit ratio exceeding 70 per cent .
UCBs have been advised to constitute special committee of the board for monitoring and following up cases of frauds involving amounts of ₹ 10 million and above exclusively .
UCBs have also been advised to become members of all the four credit information companies ( CICs ) , and furnish historical data to them with a view to enhancing accuracy of the credit information .
A High Powered Committee for UCBs ( Chairman : Shri R Gandhi ) constituted , inter alia , to examine and recommend an appropriate set of businesses , size , conversion and licensing terms for UCBs has since submitted its report .
The recommendations of the committee will be considered for implementation during the year .
The Reserve Bank will also initiate measures to improve the quality of statutory audits in UCBs during the year .
The process of harmonisation of regulation of UCBs and Rural Cooperative Banks will be continued .
The regulation of the NBFC sector is guided by the need to foster additional credit delivery channels while preserving financial Stability .
DNBR which was carved out of the erstwhile Department of Non-Banking Supervision ( DNBS ) is the nodal department for regulation of NBFCs , including stand-alone primary dealers ( PDs ) .
Further , in the light of significant progress made by NBFC-MFls following the crisis in then Andhra Pradesh in 2008-09 , a comprehensive review of their regulation was also completed during the year .
The NBFC sector has evolved considerably in terms of its size , operations , technological sophistication and entry into newer areas of financial services and products .
Accordingly , the entire regulatory framework for the sector was reviewed with a view to transitioning , over time , to an activity-based regulation of NBFCs while ensuring that NBFCs having lower risk profiles will be lightly regulated ( Box VI.3 ) .
Accordingly , a number of regulatory initiatives were undertaken covering lending by NBFCs against shares , restructuring of advances , structuring of long term project loans to infrastructure and core industries , levy of foreclosure charges and private placement of non- convertible debentures .
VI.48 In line with the Financial Stability Board ' s ( FSB ) approach to shadow banking activities , a preliminary inter-regulatory study was conducted to identify the nature of non-bank credit intermediation in India .
Accordingly , a SBIG has been formed to assess the level of regulatory compliance vis-a-vis FSB guidelines and recommend possible approaches for implementation of reforms .
SBIG is expected to Submit its report shortly .
In recent years , asset quality of the systemically important non-deposit taking NBFCs ( NBFCs-ND-SI ) has gone through the vicissitudes of overall deterioration spreading across the financial system as the economy slowed .
Their gross NPAs as per cent of credit deployed rose to 4.6 per cent by end-March 2015 ( Chart 1 ) .
With a view to strengthening the early warning system for recognising incipient financial stress , NBFCs were directed in March 2014 to create a sub-asset category ' Special Mention Accounts ' ( SMAs ) .
The revised regulatory framework for NBFCs issued in November 2014 aligns NPA norms for NBFCs with that of banks in a phased manner .
Accordingly , the time limit for classifying a loan account as NPA will be progressively reduced to 90 days by March 2018 .
Furthermore , to bring parity in the regulation of NBFCs with other financial institutions ( Fls ) in matters relating to recovery of bad loans , NBFCs registered with the Reserve Bank and having asset size of ₹ 5 billion and above will be considered for notification as Fls in terms of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest ( SARFAESI ) Act , 2002 .
All existing NBFCs ( those registered prior to April 1999 ) need to attain net owned funds ( NOFs ) of minimum ₹ 20 million in a phased manner by end-March 2017 , with failure resulting in cancellation of their Certificates of Registration .
Only NBFCs with the minimum investment grade credit rating can accept deposits .
Existing unrated Asset Finance Companies ( AFCs ) need to be rated by end- March 2016 .
Further , the limit for acceptance of deposits has been harmonised to 1.5 times the NOF across all deposit-taking NBFCs ( NBFCs-D ) .
The threshold for defining systemic significance for non-deposit taking NBFCs ( NBFCs-ND-SI ) has been revised to ₹ 5 billion .
NBFCs-NDs have been exempted from the requirement of CRAR and credit concentration norms .
Tighter prudential norms have been prescribed for NBFCs-ND-SI and all NBFCs-D in a phased manner - minimum Tier 1 capital requirement to be increased from 7.5 to 10 per cent ( by end-March 2017 ) , provision for standard assets to be increased to 0.4 per cent ( by end-March 2018 ) and dispensation of 5 per cent given to AFCs from the prescribed credit concentration norms have been done away with .
Additional corporate governance standards and disclosure norms for NBFCs have been issued to all NBFCs-D and those NBFCs-ND-SI with an asset size over ₹ 5 billion .
Accordingly , these NBFCs need to create various committees for audit , risk management and for nomination of directors based on fit and proper criteria .
They also need to frame internal board-approved corporate governance guidelines and make them public on their websites .

The government will allocate a sum of ₹ 200 billion to MUDRA from the shortfall in priority sector lending for creating a refinance fund to provide refinance to last mile financers .
Another ₹ 300 billion will be provided to MUDRA from the Budget to create a credit guarantee corpus for guaranteeing loans provided to micro-enterprises .
Further , activity based regulation is envisaged for the sector , thereby doing away with multiple categories of NBFCs .
As a first step , NBFCs are being progressively Classified into two broad heads - core investment companies and non- core investment companies .
In addition , government owned NBFCs are being brought in within the regulatory ambit of the Reserve Bank .
VI.51 DBS is entrusted with the supervisory responsibility of commercial banks , and aims at designing and implementing policies and Strategies for supervision to develop a safe and efficient banking system .
In this endeavour , managerial practices in banks and All India Financial Institutions ( AIFIs ) that strengthen their corporate governance and internal controls are also encouraged .
Appropriate legislation is being drafted by the central government for setting up MUDRA .
Pending legislative approval , MUDRA Ltd. was incorporated on March 18 , 2015 , under the Companies Act , 2013 , as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Small Industries Development Bank of India ( SIDBI ) to carry out activities relating to development and financing of small micro-enterprises , and was registered with the Reserve Bank as a non-deposit taking NBFC on April 6 , 2015 .
SIDBI has been exempted for its proposed investment of 7.5 billion in MUDRA from the cross-holding of capital among banks / Fls .
VI.52 The Reserve Bank is moving progressively from a performance based CAMELS ( capital adequacy , asset quality , management , earning , liquidity and system and control ) framework to a forward looking RBS framework for early detection of risks , timely and appropriate supervisory interventions and more generally for improving the quality of supervisory processes in line with global best practices .
Two more banks were brought under RBS in 2014-15 , taking the total to 30 major banks .
Six more banks have been migrated to RBS framework from 2015-16 assessment cycle .
The RBS model was also optimised , fine-tuning data collection from commercial banks .
The need for preparedness at the banks ' level , including a robust management information system for RBS was highlighted .
Alongside , the existing PCA framework for banks , first introduced in 2002 is being revamped .
VI.55 As part of cross-border supervisory cooperation and exchange of information , the Reserve Bank signed MoUs with six overseas banking supervisory authorities in 2014-15 - Hong Kong Monetary Authority ; Central Bank of Kenya ; Banco Central do Brasil ; Bank of Uganda ; Central Bank of Seychelles and Maldives Monetary Authority .
A statement of cooperation with three US financial regulators , viz . , Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , Office of the Comptroller of Currency and Federal Deposits Insurance Corporation has also been established .
Till date , the Reserve Bank has executed 26 MoUs , one letter for supervisory cooperation and one statement of cooperation with overseas Supervisors / regulators .
VI.56 In line with the BCBS principles on cross- border consolidated supervision , the Reserve Bank is instituting supervisory colleges for Indian banks with considerable overseas presence .
Supervisory colleges have been set up for State Bank of India , ICICI Bank Ltd . , Bank of Baroda , Bank of India , Punjab National Bank and Axis Bank Ltd .
VI.57 Going forward , all small foreign banks operating in India are set to be brought into RBS .
While a new format is being devised for inspection of the AIFIs - National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development ( NABARD ) , SIDBI , Export- Import ( EXIM ) Bank of India and the National Housing Bank ( NHB ) , the revised format for CRILC reporting , including improved analytics is expected to be rolled out soon .
In coordination with the IRDA , it is proposed to collect CRILC data from insurance companies as well .
VI.58 All Off-site Monitoring and Surveillance System ( OSMOS ) returns are planned to migrate to an eXtensible Business Reporting Language ( XBRL ) / data warehouse environment towards developing a single information system for Supervisory purposes .
A new framework for fraud detection , reporting and monitoring has been rolled out on May 7 , 2015 .
Further , a central fraud registry for use by banks is also under preparation .
Though disparate systems used by the regulated entities hinder the process of automated data flow , the Reserve Bank will continue to encourage banks to switch over to entirely automated modes of data submission .
VI.59 Capacity building , with particular focus on RBS processes , system audit and information technology vulnerability / penetration testing , is planned to be rolled out in 2015-16 .
The EWS as well as the revamped PCA framework for banks are likely to be finalised in 2015-16 .
Work relating to developing a PCA framework for FCs is expected to be initiated in coordination with other domestic regulators .
The Reserve Bank is also exploring ways , including appropriate penal measures towards improving the compliance culture amongst regulated entities .
Vl.60 DCBS was carved out of the erstwhile Urban Banks Department ( UBD ) and it is primarily focused on ensuring the financial soundness of individual UCBs as well as the sector as a whole .
Vl.61 During the year , 968 UCBs , comprising all scheduled UCBs , C and D rated non-scheduled UCBs , and A and B rated non-scheduled UCBs due for inspection , were subjected to on-site inspections and appropriate supervisory action .
While the licences of nine UCBs were cancelled , two UCBs were merged with other UCBs and ' All Inclusive Directions ' were imposed on seven UCBs .
All the 1,589 UCBs were supervised through off-site surveillance system .
Towards developing a single point platform for data collection , processing and dissemination , 13 returns for UCBs have been migrated to the XBRL- based reporting system from the existing off-site surveillance reporting system .
Training programmes to improve professionalism and governance in UCBs were also organised by the Reserve Bank .
VI.62 While ensuring effective supervision of UCBs , further reduction in the number of UCBs with negative net worth has been envisaged for 2015-16 .
The migration of all the returns to the XBRL-based reporting platform will be completed in the coming year .
The initiatives for capacity building in the UCB sector will be carried forward in the coming year too .
VI.63 This department is the supervisory wing of NBFCs and it aims at establishing an enabling environment for a healthy and sound NBFC sector while protecting the interests of depositors , customers and other stakeholders as also safeguarding the country ' s financial system from contagion risks out of this sector .
The department also endeavours to increase public awareness on the legal / regulatory framework for entities engaged in various types of financial activities .
VI.64 Deposit taking and systemically important non-deposit taking NBFCs continued to be the focus of on-site inspections .
During 2014-15 , 72 deposit taking companies and 182 non-deposit taking companies were inspected .
To deal with delinquent and unauthorised entities , SLCCs were reconstituted in May 2014 with the Chief Secretary to the State Government as the Chairman and the Reserve Bank as the secretariat to facilitate regular sharing of market intelligence ( MI ) and taking coordinated timely action .
The Reserve Bank also hosted two conferences of Chief Secretaries / Administrators of the states / union territories ( UTs ) during the year to deliberate on issues concerning fund mobilisations by unauthorised entities .
MI cells were also created across 16 regional offices of the Reserve Bank .
VI.65 Asset Reconstruction Companies ( ARCs ) have been steadily increasing their presence in the debt recovery process ( Table VI.1 ) .
At the end of March 2015 , there were 15 securitisation companies ( SCs ) / reconstruction companies ( RCs ) registered with the Reserve Bank .
At end- March 2015 , the book value of assets acquired by the ARCs stood at around ₹ 508 billion .
While the ARCs are already under off-site surveillance , they will be supervised through on-site inspections in the coming year in view of their increasing importance .
For dissemination of information amongst SLCC members / general public , a dedicated website will be launched in the coming year .
CRILC information on large borrowers from NBFCs will be taken up for analysis once the platform is fully Operationalised .
The consultative approach followed by the department is proposed to be formalised to having periodical interactions with the industry in 2015-16 .
VI.67 Deposit insurance extended by DICGC , a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank , covers all banks including LABs , regional rural banks ( RRBs ) and cooperative banks in the country .
As per the International Association of Deposit Insurers ' ( IADI ) Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance System 2014 , deposit insurance coverage should be limited , credible and cover a large majority of depositors but leave a substantial amount of deposits exposed to market discipline .
The current limit of deposit insurance is ₹ 0.1 million per depositor in the same right and same capacity .
As on March 31 , 2015 , 92.3 per cent of the accounts were fully protected .
Amount-wise , insured deposits at ₹ 26.1 trillion constituted nearly 31 per cent of the assessable deposits .
An effective deposit insurance design should be capable of managing its risk by seeking compensation for the risks being transferred to it .
Hence , risk-based collection of premium could be an important step in this direction ( Box VI.5 ) .
In order to deal with this kind of moral hazard , the premium of deposit insurance should properly reflect the effective underlying risk associated with a bank ' s activities .
It could be partially mitigated by introducing risk- adjusted premium for a deposit insurance scheme .
Although a flat-rate premium system has the advantage of being relatively easy to understand and administer , it does not take into account the level of risk that a bank poses to the deposit insurance system and can be perceived as unfair in terms of premium rate and risk profile across banks ( IADI 2011 ) .
Literature on deposit insurance identifies two different approaches for determining risk-based premium .
The expected loss pricing approach is centred on the expected default probability of a bank , which can be estimated using either fundamentals , rating or market analysis .
The Merton type approach uses option pricing theory in order to estimate the probability of default by a company .
In practice , risk-based contributions are defined in terms of a contribution base , adjusted for a factor that is proportional to the risk attitude of the members and a factor reflecting the overall conditions in the banking system in the respective country ( Walter and Schaller , 2012 ) .
The practice in the European Union ( EU ) suggests that key financial ratios currently applied in assessment of a member institution ' s risk across member states are quite heterogeneous and the variables taken into account to define them are not identical .
The 2014 EU Directive on Deposit Insurance Schemes gives only broad guidance for a risk measure but leaves the fine details to the wisdom of member states .
In the US , new rules for risk- based assessment were issued in November 2006 and significant refinements were made to risk-related premium pursuant to financial reform legislation enacted in 2010 .
For small banks , supervisory CAMELS ratings are combined with financial ratios to determine risk- based assessment rates against deposits .
For large banks , in 2011 , the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) adopted a risk differentiation scheme that combines CAMELS rating and forward looking financial measures of risk .
In India , there have been periodic recommendations for the application of risk-based premium for banks .
The Narasimham Committee Report on Banking Sector Reforms ( 1998 ) , while focusing on structural issues recommended introduction of a risk-based premium system in lieu of the flat-rate premium system .
The size of the deposit insurance fund ( DIF ) stood at ₹ 504.5 billion as at end-March 2015 , yielding a reserve ratio ( DIF / insured deposits ) of 1.9 per cent .
VI.69 NHB , a wholly owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank , was set up on July 9 , 1988 , under the National Housing Bank Act , 1987 , to operate as a principal agency to promote housing finance institutions both at local and regional levels and to provide financial and other support incidental to such institutions .
VI.70 As the apex institution for housing finance , NHB registers , regulates and supervises housing finance companies ( HFCs ) .
NHB is focused on promoting innovative market based solutions for affordable housing finance to low income housing segments .
NHB extends refinance to HFC , scheduled commercial banks ( SCBs ) and cooperative sector institutions , against their housing loans .
It also provides project lending to a range of borrowers in public and public-private partnerships , MFls , State level housing boards and area development authorities for large scale integrated housing projects and slum redevelopment projects .
The cumulative disbursements in 2014-15 stood around ₹ 218.5 billion of which 25.4 per cent ( ₹ 55.4 billion ) was made for rural housing loans under the Rural Housing Fund ( RHF ) and the Golden Jubilee Rural Housing Refinance Scheme ( GJRHRS ) .
VI.71 The government has identified NHB as one of the central nodal agencies to channelise subsidy to lending institutions and monitoring the progress of the component under the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme ( CLSS ) .
CLSS will be implemented across the country in all 4,041 statutory towns ( as per Census 2011 ) and is part of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Housing for All ( HFA ) mission , which seeks to address the housing requirements of urban poor , including of slum dwellers .
NHB has also been a nodal agency for government schemes , such as the Interest Subsidy Scheme for Housing the Urban Poor ( ISHUP ) , 1 per cent Interest Subvention scheme and the Solar Capital Subsidy scheme .
VI.72 NHB also manages the Credit Risk Guarantee Fund Trust for low income housing set up by the Government of India to ensure better flow of institutional credit for housing in urban areas .
NHB launched RESIDEX in July 2007 for tracking residential property prices across 26 cities in India on a quarterly basis .
The central government enhanced allocations for NHB from ₹ 40 billion to ₹ 80 billion in 2014-15 to expand and Support rural housing in the country .
VI.73 CEPD focuses on pursuing public interest , providing a level playing field between suppliers and consumers of financial services by reducing the imbalances emanating from information asymmetries , limited product choices , inadequate disclosures , etc .
Consumer protection is a key to promoting financial inclusion .
VI.74 As a structured measure towards protection of bank customers and setting standards of customer service , a Charter of Customer Rights as broad , over-arching principles for protecting bank customers was formulated by the Reserve Bank in 2014-15 ( Box VI.6 ) .
The Charter of Customer Rights released on December 3 , 2014 , enshrines broad , over-arching principles for protection of bank customers and enunciates five basic rights for bank customers as : ( i ) Right to Fair Treatment : Both the customer and the financial services provider have a right to be treated with courtesy .
The customer should not be unfairly discriminated against on grounds such as gender , age , religion , caste and physical ability when offering and delivering financial products .
( ii ) Right to Transparency , Fair and Honest Dealing : The financial services provider should make every effort to ensure that the contracts or agreements it frames are transparent , easily understood and well communicated to the common person .
The product ' s price , associated risks , customer ' s responsibilities and the terms and conditions that govern its use over the product ' s life- cycle , should be clearly disclosed .
The customer should not be subject to unfair business or marketing practices , coercive contractual terms or misleading representations .
Over the course of their relationship , the financial services provider cannot threaten the customer with physical harm , exert undue influence or engage in blatant harassment .
( iii ) Right to Suitability : The products offered should be appropriate to the needs of the customer and based on an assessment of the customer ' s financial circumstances and understanding .
( iv ) Right to Privacy : Customers ' personal information should be kept confidential unless they have offered specific consent to the financial services provider or such information is required to be provided under the law or it is provided for a mandated business purpose ( for example , to credit information companies ) .
The customer should be informed upfront about likely mandated business purposes .
Customers have the right to protection from all kinds of communications , electronic or otherwise , which infringe upon their privacy .
( v ) Right to Grievance Redress and Compensation : The customer has a right to hold the financial services provider accountable for the products offered and to have a clear and easy way to have any valid grievances redressed .
VI.75 For strengthening the grievance redressal mechanism available to bank customers , all PSBs , select private sector and foreign banks were advised to appoint Chief Customer Service Officers as Internal Ombudsman in banks who should examine complaints , which remained unresolved / partially resolved by the internal grievance redressal mechanism of the bank .
The financial services provider must communicate its compensation policy for mistakes , lapses in conduct , as well as non-performance or delays in performance , whether caused by the provider or otherwise .
The policy must lay out the rights and duties of the customer when such events occur .
These rights aim to protect the customer against unfair discrimination , unfair business or marketing practices , coercive contractual terms or misleading representations and aim to promote appropriate need warranted financial products with a better understanding of the various risks and charges involved therein .
The feedback received was forwarded to all stakeholders .
Further , in view of the large number of complaints on fictitious offers of money , public awareness campaigns about such fictitious offers , including the availability of the Banking Ombudsman ( BO ) scheme were conducted , particularly in rural and semi-urban areas .
VI.77 The Reserve Bank will focus on full-fledged operationalisation of the Charter of Customer Rights in banks .
The BO scheme is also being taken up for a complete review in 2015-16 .
Focused field visits / study on mis-selling by banks in semi-urban areas and non-functioning / mal- functioning ATMs across various parts of the country have also been planned .
The Reserve Bank successfully completed the borrowing programme of the Government of India and the state governments during 2014-15 despite several challenges , such as scaling up of the size of borrowing and elevated yields in the first half of the year .
In pursuance of the objective of minimising the rollover risk , the maturity profile of the debt portfolio was elongated during the year with a resultant marginal increase in weighted cost .
Leveraging on increased appetite for longer maturity debt , the Reserve Bank announced issuance of 40-year security during 2015-16 to extend the yield curve beyond 30 years .
A medium term debt management strategy in line with sound international practices , regular quarterly calendar for state borrowings , review of the WMA scheme for the states , an efficient market infrastructure to aid a deeper and wider government debt market and expanding the investors ' base , are some of the important agenda items slated for 2015-16 .
VII.1 In terms of Sections 20 and 21 of the Reserve Bank of India Act , 1934 , the Reserve Bank has the obligation and right to transact Central Government business in India and manage its public debt .
Similarly , the Reserve Bank is the debt manager for all the 29 state governments and the union territory of Puducherry as also a banker to them except the Government of Sikkim in terms of their agreement with the Reserve Bank under Section 21A of the RBI Act , 1934 .
Further , the Reserve Bank makes advances to the Central and state governments to tide over temporary mismatch in the cash flows .
Such advances are termed as ' ways and means advances ' ( WMA ) , which are repayable in each case not later than three months from the date of making the advances in terms of Section 17 ( 5 ) of the RBI Act .
VII.2 The Reserve Bank has set for itself a medium-term agenda of transforming the financial sector into a stronger , deeper , more efficient and inclusive system .
Within this broader agenda , the approach for debt management as entrusted to the Internal Debt Management Department ( IDMD ) encompasses : a comprehensive debt management strategy in alignment with sound international practices , minimising the borrowing cost , extending maturities to cater to the requirements of diverse investors , consolidation of public debt and reduction in the rollover risk through active switch / buyback operations .
VII.3 In 2014-15 , the debt management strategy aimed to : ( i ) conduct debt management operations in an orderly manner and successfully meet the market borrowing programmes in smooth and non-disruptive manner while minimising the cost of borrowing ; ( ii ) ensure reasonable distribution in issuances over the first half and the second half with issuance of new bonds coupled with bonds of non-standard maturity to avoid concentration of redemptions in the first half of the year ; ( iii ) smoothen the maturity profile of GoI securities to reduce redemption pressures in 2014-15 through buybacks / switches ; ( iv ) ensure quicker and wider dissemination of auctions related information to market participants and other stakeholders ; ( v ) promote liquidity in government securities ( G-secs ) through a scheme for market making by PDs in semi-liquid and illiquid G-secs ; and ( vi ) improve efficiency of cash management and ensure reasonable returns on the CSF / GRF ( consolidated sinking fund / guarantee redemption fund ) of the states .
VII.4 The gross market borrowings of ₹ 5,920 billion ( BE ₹ 6,000 billion ) and net market borrowings of ₹ 4,532 billion , which funded 90.3 per cent of the gross fiscal deficit ( GFD ) , were successfully raised in 2014-15 ( Table VII.1 ) .
VII.5 Debt management operations faced several challenges during 2014-15 .
First , the combined market borrowings of the Centre and the states increased over the level in the preceding year in both gross and net terms ( that is , net of repayments ) resulting in a sizeable scaling up of debt issuances in the primary market , particularly for the states .
The Reserve Bank held auctions of government securities ( including T-bills and SDLs or state development loans ) on 118 days , leading to a total of 548 issuances and 41 underwriting auctions .
Second , elevated level of yields in the first half of the year when the borrowing programme was front- loaded posed challenges for the cost of borrowing .
Under these testing conditions , the efficacy of debt management can be gauged from the modest 12 bps increase in the weighted average yield of dated securities issued by the Centre during the year to 8.51 per cent ( Table VII.2 ) despite a lengthening of maturity .
Third , the Reserve Bank continued debt consolidation through reissuances and eased redemption pressures through buybacks / switches during the year and also elongated the maturity profile of government debt , thereby mitigating rollover risks .
VII.6 Although yields on government dated securities gradually declined during the course of the year from relatively higher levels in the early months ( Chart VII.1 ) , the weighted average yield of dated securities issued during 2014-15 was somewhat higher than in the previous year .
Higher issuances of long dated securities lengthened the average maturity of outstanding debt ( Table VII.3 ) .
VII.7 As part of the consolidation of Government debt , 95 per cent of the securities were reissued .
# : Issuance through dated securities ; * : upto August 14 , 2015 .
A conversion operation of securities from the Reserve Bank ' s portfolio amounting to ₹ 302 billion was conducted in March 2015 .
Continuing its pursuit of the market development strategy , the Reserve Bank ensured quicker and wider dissemination of auction related information among market participants and other stakeholders .
The system of displaying primary auction results of treasury bills , SDLs and Gol dated securities in e-Kuber and NDS-OM along with publication of the results on the Reserve Bank ' s website has been implemented .
Table VII.3 : Issuance of the Central Government Dated Securities - Maturity Pattern
VII.10 The Government started the fiscal year with a cash build-up of ₹ 1,284 billion and the cash position remained comfortable until the third week of May 2014 ( Chart VII.2 ) .
Following spending by the Government , cash balance declined and the Government intermittently availed WMA for 61 days altogether vis-a-vis 42 days during the previous year .
The Government ended the fiscal year with a cash balance of ₹ 1,573 billion .
VII.12 WMA limits for the first half ( April-September ) and the second half ( October-March ) of 2014-15 were fixed at ₹ 350 billion and ₹ 200 billion , respectively , for the Central Government .
The WMA limit for the first half of 2015-16 was raised to ₹ 450 billion .
VII.13 The Reserve Bank entered into an agreement with the Government of Telangana for carrying out its cash and debt management operations effective June 2 , 2014 , under section 21A of the Reserve Bank of India Act , 1934 .
All of them participated in market borrowing programme in 2014-15 , with the net borrowing rising by 26 per cent ( Table VII.4 ) .
VII.14 Despite higher market borrowings , the weighted average yeild of state government securities issued during the year stood lower at 8.58 per cent as compared to 9.18 per cent last year .
Alongside , the weighted average spread came down significantly to 38 bps over Gol securities of comparable maturities from 75 bps in the previous year ( Table VII.4 ) .
VII.15 The Reserve Bank has been extending WMA to state governments since 1937 under the provisions of Section 17 ( 5 ) of the RBI Act with the objective of covering temporary mismatches in their cash flows .
There are two types of WMA : ( i ) normal WMA or clean advances , and ( ii ) special WMA ( SWMA ) or secured advances ( the nomenclature of SWMA was changed in June 2014 as ' special drawing facility ' ( SDF ) by amending the agreement with state governments ) .
An overdraft ( OD ) occurs whenever the Reserve Bank ' s credit to a state government exceeds the SDF and WMA limits .
VII.16 The aggregate WMA limit for the states , including the Government of the Union Territory of Puducherry was raised by 50 per cent to ₹ 154 billion in November 2013 and the same limit was continued in 2014-15 .
The monthly average utilisation of WMA and OD by the states was higher in 2014-15 even as the number of states resorting to WMA remained unchanged at 12 .
Fourteen States resorted to SDF , up from 12 in 2013-14 .
Ten States availed of OD in 2014-15 as against eight States in 2013-14 .
VII.17 The Reserve Bank ' s recent initiatives in the government banking business are expected to enhance efficiency in the cash management of state governments ( Box VII.1 ) .
In addition to dated government securities , the Reserve Bank has Started investing in SDLs and other high yielding securities ( for example , treasury bills ) as per the mandate given by the respective state governments .
The outstanding investment in CSF and GRF stood at ₹ 703 billion at end-March 2015 , a rise of 14.8 per cent over the previous year .
In its endeavour to create awareness among Finance Department officials of state governments , capacity building programmes were organised by the Reserve Bank in a number of states including Tripura , Mizoram , Jharkhand , Odisha and Uttarakhand .
VII.19 Union Budget , 2015-16 has projected a marginal increase in the Centre ' s net market borrowings in 2015-16 .
For instance , it is performed by the central banks in France and Russia while in the UK and Australia it is performed by commercial banks .
The payment processing is centralised in France and Russia but decentralised in South Africa .
Larger countries , such as the US , China and India have adopted a mixed approach , depending on the nature and type of transactions ( Chart 1 ) .
As part of its initiatives to improve efficiency in government banking services , the Reserve Bank constituted a Working Group to Bring in Uniformity and Standardisation in Procedures / Data Structure of e-Receipt / e-Transactions of State Governments .
The group submitted its report in April 2014 .
Its recommendations focus on migrating to a broadly uniform model for receipts and payments for all the states and integration with e-Kuber , the core banking solution of the Reserve Bank .
As discussed in the State Finance Secretaries Conference organised by the Reserve Bank in May 2015 , it was decided to implement the recommendations of the report on a pan-India basis .
Till date , 15 states have started this process and are at various stages of implementation .
The agency banks participating in the revenue collection of a state are required to prepare details of daily receipts in a standardised ISO 20022 format file and upload it on the e-Kuber portal which is used by banks for their interface with the Reserve Bank .
After processing the files , e-scrolls with all relevant information are transmitted electronically to the state governments in a straight-through-processing ( STP ) manner .
The interface of e-Kuber with the public finance management system ( PFMS ) of the Central Government has been scaled up to serve all central ministries for effecting inter-government transactions on a STP basis .
For e-payments , wherever a state has a centralised treasury system , integration of its IT system with e-Kuber will be done and the details of payments to be effected by the government will be directly received , processed and transmitted to the National Electronic Funds Transfer ( NEFT ) system for effecting payments , with no manual intervention .
Transaction- wise e-scrolls will be sent on the same day , duly indicating status of payments ( whether successful , or returned ) .
This will ensure that all payments are processed efficiently and beneficiaries receive the payments without delay .
With a view to maximising benefits from technological developments , a Working Group on Business Process Re- engineering with participation from government agencies , banks and the Reserve Bank has been set up .
The group will examine the workflows , systems and processes for handling government business , related institutional infrastructure and reporting structures .
The group is expected to submit its report by October 2015 .
With these initiatives , banking arrangements of the governments including their cash management are set to witness significant efficiencies in the years to come .

To cater to the demand from long term investors like insurance companies and pension funds , a 40-year security is proposed to be issued during 2015-16 , taking in view a relatively flat yield curve .
VII.21 Market borrowings of state governments have been budgeted higher for 2015-16 than the previous year .
To improve predictability of market borrowings , all the states will be encouraged to move over to a quarterly calendar of issuances with effect from 2015-16 and the first of this calendar has been announced for the second quarter of 2015-16 .
The states have also been advised to actively engage with investors within their states to diversify the investor base .
VII.22 The report of the Advisory Committee on Ways and Means Advance to State Governments ( Chairman : Sumit Bose ) is expected to be finalised and will be taken up for implementation .
VII.23 The Reserve Bank will continue with the agenda of enabling easier and increased access to retail investors .
As part of this , a web-based solution on the e-Kuber platform for participation of all mid-segment / retail investors having gilt accounts is being implemented .
To develop a more liquid government securities market , a scheme of market making in select semi-liquid securities by PDs will be implemented .
The non-competitive bidding facility available to retail investors is currently applicable only to auctions of dated securities .
It is proposed to allow the non-competitive bidding facility in treasury bills to individuals as well .
The Reserve Bank in consultation with all stakeholders will enable seamless movement of securities from the subsidiary general ledger ( SGL ) form to demat form and vice versa to promote trading of G-secs on stock exchanges .
The Reserve Bank will work to put in place a more predictable framework on the size and scope of investments in G-secs by foreign portfolio investors taking into account the risks and benefits associated with such flows into the debt market .
VII.24 The Reserve Bank will closely work with the Government of India in the preparatory arrangements for the establishment of the Public Debt Management Agency ( PDMA ) .
Banknotes and coins continued to be in high demand in 2014-15 .
The Reserve Bank intensified its efforts to strengthen further the security features to improve integrity of banknotes .
The Reserve Bank entered into agreements with banks to expand the currency management base .
In consultation with the Government of India , the Reserve Bank made efforts towards the indigenisation of banknotes .
VIII.1 In line with the core statutory functions envisaged for it as per the Preamble and Section 22 of the Reserve Bank of India Act , 1934 , the approach adopted by the Reserve Bank for currency management operations during 2014-15 focused on ensuring an adequate supply of clean banknotes and coins of various denominations to meet legitimate business requirements of members of the public , and creating , stocking and distributing banknotes and coins and destruction of soiled , mutilated notes and uncurrent coins .
VIII.2 Demand for banknotes and coins increased in 2014-15 , notwithstanding the use of technology driven non-cash modes of payment .
VIII.3 The value of banknotes in circulation increased by 11.4 per cent to ₹ 14,289 billion as at end-March 2015 over the previous year .
Further , the volume of banknotes in circulation increased by 8.1 per cent to 83.6 billion pieces over the same period .
Notes of denominations of ₹ 500 and ₹ 1,000 together accounted for approximately 85 per cent of the total value of banknotes in circulation at end- March 2015 .
VIII.5 In recent years , demand for coins has increased at a faster place vis-a-vis supply mainly due to several toll plazas operating in the country , structure of bus / auto / train / taxi fares , rising affluence of rural and urban poor , especially in view of Government sponsored schemes like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and increased use of fast-moving consumer goods ( FMCG ) in small sachets .
Mismatch in indent and supply of coins during the past few years is given in Table VIII.3.
VIII.6 To meet the enhanced demand , the Reserve Bank has increased the indent with the Government of India mints and taken the following additional steps to further streamline distribution : ( i ) Shopkeepers and other business establishments , tollgate agencies , etc . , have been linked to the nearest currency chest for their requirement of coins ; ( ii ) Banks were advised to organise coin melas for issue of coins directly to members of the public ; ( iii ) Bulk users of coins , such as large retailers and toll plazas have been advised to increase the usage of point of sale ( POS ) terminals / cards / e-tokens in order to reduce their dependence on coins ; and ( iv ) Banks were being incentivised for establishing coin vending machines ( CVMs ) and machines which extend cash related services to the public .
VIII.7 The Reserve Bank has suggested to the Central Government to permit import of coins as a short term measure till the production capacity of the mints is augmented ; consider allowing minting of coins by private parties as enabled under the Coinage Act , 2011 ; and increase the present production capacity of mints / set up new mints as a medium term measure .
The Reserve Bank is also working on ways to encourage recirculation of coins by members of the public .
VIII.8 Currency management infrastructure consists of a network of 19 issue offices , 4,132 currency chests ( including sub-treasury offices and a currency chest of the Reserve Bank at Kochi ) and 3,813 small coin depots of commercial , cooperative and regional rural banks spread across the country ( Table VIII.4 ) .
The procedure for opening currency chests was simplified during the year by introducing a single layer approval system instead of the multiple layers of approvals .
The lead bank as a nodal bank for currency management ( BCM ) attends to issues , such as linkage of non- currency chest branches to currency chests , facilitation of supply and issue of banknotes and coins to and from bank branches in the area , prompt routing of diversion requests and redressal of public grievances .
The nodal BCM undertakes functions relating to spreading awareness / literacy Campaigns on security features of genuine notes and exchange of mutilated notes .
After a year of operation , the scheme was reviewed and it was decided to continue it in 2014-15 ; it is under review for 2015-16 .
VIII.10 Demand for currency is estimated using econometric models inter alia , factoring in real GDP growth prospects , rate of inflation and disposal rate of soiled notes denomination-wise .
Accordingly , the total supply of banknotes was raised to 23.7 billion in 2014-15 from 20.9 billion pieces ( an increase of 13.1 per cent ) in 2013-14 ( Table VIII.5 ) .
* * Includes 5 million pieces of ₹ 1 currency notes .
Table VIII.7 : Number of Counterfeit Notes Detected ( April to March )
Does not include counterfeit notes seized by the police and other enforcement agencies .
India is the largest producer and consumer of currency notes , next only to China .
Currency continues to be the dominant means of payment with the banknotes in circulation ( in value terms ) placed at ₹ 14.3 trillion as of end March 2015 .
Sustained increase in demand for currency notes , exceeded the capacity of government note presses ( at Nashik and Dewas ) by the late 1980s .
The Reserve Bank established two currency presses in 1996 at Mysore and Salboni through a wholly owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank , the Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Pvt. Ltd . ( BRBNMPL ) , making the country self reliant in currency note printing by 1999 .
Currently , more than 40 per cent of the currency notes circulated in India are printed by government presses while the remaining 60 per cent emanate from Reserve Bank currency presses .
However , the Reserve Bank depends largely on imports for the main ingredients required for printing currency .
In case of inks , India produces Offset and Intaglio ink while Optically Variable Ink is imported .
Some of the security features , such as security thread and water mark used in the current series of banknotes are also imported .
VIII.15 On issues in currency management , the Department of Currency Management ( DCM ) plays a pivotal role in ensuring continuous supply and circulation of adequate quantities of clean banknotes and good coins of various denominations across the country .
During 2014-15 , the goals set for the Reserve Bank included field trial of plastic banknotes , exploring alternatives for extending the life of banknotes , harnessing technological advancements in the area of storage , transport , distribution ; setting up a fully automated cash processing centre ( CPC ) on a pilot basis , introduction of new series of banknotes to leverage the latest innovations of currency note printing technology to stay ahead of counterfeiters , redesigning coins to make them user friendly and long lasting , and improving banknote packaging to facilitate handling and making operational processes more labour friendly .
Dependence on imports makes the printing process of currency vulnerable in terms of price , quantity and timeliness .
The Reserve Bank has embarked on a multi-pronged strategy for the indigenisation of currency note printing , keeping in view the associated benefits of backward integration in the form of assured , smooth and timely supply , cost saving ( by way of reduction in the import bill ) , employment generation and effective deterrent to counterfeiting .
To enhance the pace of indigenisation , a paper mill is being setup in Mysore , with an annual capacity of 12,000 MT which will substantially meet the paper requirement for currency printing .
The Reserve Bank is also making efforts to develop domestic capabilities in the area of security features of banknotes .
In order to have a time-bound programme for indigenisation of security features , the Reserve Bank , in consultation with the Government of India has set up a high level steering committee ( Chairman : Shri R. Gandhi ) which will identify agencies / institutions that could be encouraged to develop indigenous security features over the next few years .
VIII.16 The request for proposal for supply of plastic Indian banknotes in the denomination of ₹ 10 was issued and its technical evaluation undertaken .
However , certain technical infirmities emerged and the process could not be taken further .
VIII.17 A committee comprising stakeholders and research institutions was constituted to evaluate means to elongate the life of banknotes .
A study on the subject has been taken up and is expected to be completed in 2015-16 .
VIII.18 It was felt that a hub and spoke model would lead to greater efficiency .
Accordingly , commercial banks were encouraged to set up such processing centres and two banks have commenced establishment of CPCs .
VIII.19 Banknotes in the denomination of ₹ 100 with a new numbering pattern were introduced during the year .
The new numbering pattern will be introduced in a phased manner in all other denominations .
In June 2015 , the process of introduction of new security features was taken forward through issuance ofa global pre-qualification bid for supply of security features .
VIII.20 The Government of India has decided to constitute a committee to look into the shape and size of coins .
It was decided , in consultation with stakeholders , to introduce corrugated fibre boxes for packing of banknotes in accordance with the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) Convention 127 and recommendation 128 ( wherein , maximum weight to be carried by an adult workman should not exceed 55 kg ) .
Such boxes will be more environment friendly than wooden boxes which are presently in use .
Two of the printing presses have commenced supplies of banknotes in the new corrugated fibre boxes .
VIII.21 Taking forward the activities initiated in 2014-15 in the areas of introduction of new series of banknotes , new numbering pattern , braille like signs for the differently abled , and clean note policy , the Reserve Bank plans the following initiatives during 2015-16 : towards elongating the life of banknotes , a development tender on plastic banknotes will be considered .
Further , the project of exploring other alternatives for increasing the life of banknotes will be taken forward .
VIII.22 The scheme of incentives and penalties for banks for provision of banknotes and coin related services will be rationalised .
The distribution network of banknotes and coins will be strengthened by encouraging alternate means , including leveraging technology .
Further , note refund rules which were last reviewed in 2009 , will be taken up for further refinement .
The Reserve Bank will continue with its medium / long term objective of indigenisation of security features for Indian banknotes .
VIII.24 BRBNMPL produces 60 per cent of the annual requirement of banknotes and had supplied 15,515.88 million banknotes to the Reserve Bank as at end-March , 2015 .
It recorded a net profit after tax of ₹ 1.38 billion during 2014-15 as against a net profit after tax of ₹ 1.33 billion in the previous year .
VIII.25 The company has been continually enhancing productivity and operational efficiency through research and development activities and process innovations .
It has established testing and research facilities at its laboratories in Mysore and Salboni for ensuring strict quality controls .
These laboratories are currently focused on enhancing the life of banknotes , selection and evaluation of substrates for banknotes , comparison of various materials and their properties , and evaluation of security features .
VIII.26 The Bank Note Paper Mill India Private Limited ( BNPMIPL ) in Mysore , with a capacity of 12,000 tonnes per annum was established in October 2010 as an equal joint venture between the Government of India owned SPMCIL and the Reserve Bank subsidiary BRBNMPL .
However , glitches arising out of the processes and modalities of securing statutory approvals from the concerned agencies impeded operationalisation of the facility .
It is expected to commence production in 2015-16 .
This facility is expected to lead to self-sufficiency in manufacturing of paper for banknotes , substantially reducing imports .
In pursuance of the vision of encouraging electronic payments and achieving a less cash society , the Reserve Bank continued its endeavour to have safe , inclusive and efficient payment systems in the country .
Initiatives in this direction included rationalisation of policies relating to ATM transactions , prepaid payment instruments , white label ATMs and relaxation of additional factor of authentication for small value contact-less card present payments .
In addition , the Reserve Bank also initiated the process of infrastructure enhancement in bill payments and MSME bill discounting segments by putting in place policy framework for setting up of Bharat Bill Payment System ( BBPS ) and Trade Receivables Discounting System ( TReDS ) .
The Reserve Bank also undertook a slew of in-house IT initiatives to brace up with the emerging challenges .
IX.1 Efficient and secure payment and settlement systems are essential components of a well-developed financial system .
The department being the nodal wing of the Reserve Bank in matters of payment and settlement systems , focused towards migrating to a less cash society and on enhancing the efficiency and security of electronic transactions , while at the same time improving convenience of operations .
Another key area of focus was enhancing access to finance through strengthening the inter-operable payment system infrastructure and putting in place a firm legal basis for payment system activities in conformity with international standards .
With a view to ensuring seamless financial transactions , the Reserve Bank has been leveraging technology to upgrade the payment and settlement systems on a continuous basis over the years , resulting in a gradual shift from cash and paper based transactions to electronic modes of payments .
The Reserve Bank while taking all these steps , recognised developments in technology and provided a facilitating environment for innovations in the payments sphere .
IX.2 The electronic payment systems registered high volumes in 2014-15 , following the determined efforts made by the Reserve Bank for migration to electronic payments ( Table IX.1 ) .
Overall , the payment and settlement systems posted a higher growth of 27.1 per cent in volume and a lower growth of 5.4 per cent in value in 2014-15 in relation to the previous year .
In volume terms , paper-based transactions accounted for 25.4 per cent of the total transactions during 2014-15 , down from 33.9 per cent in the previous year .
Their share in value terms also declined to 5.4 per cent from 6.2 per cent .
The figures of cards are for transactions at point of sale ( POS ) terminals only .
The National Automated Clearing House ( NACH ) system was started by the National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) ( on December 29 , 2012 ) , to facilitate inter-bank , high volume , electronic transactions which are repetitive and periodic in nature .
NEFT handled 928 million transactions valued at around ₹ 60 trillion in 2014-15 as against 661 million transactions for ₹ 44 trillion in the previous year .
During the month of March 2015 , NEFT processed the largest ever monthly volume of 106 million transactions .
IX.5 The increasing trend is also reflected incase of bulk electronic payments systems [ total of electronic clearing service ( ECS ) and National Automated Clearing House ( NACH ) ] .
Banks continued to use both NACH operated by National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) as well as ECS operated by the Reserve Bank .
IX.6 As regards card transactions , during 2014- 15,615 million transactions valued at around 1.9 trillion were carried out through credit cards , while 808 million transactions valued at ₹ 1.2 trillion were carried out through debit cards .
Transactions through prepaid payment instruments ( PPIs ) also grew substantially , recording 314 million transactions valued at ₹ 212 billion .
Mobile banking service , which is a relatively newer entrant among the payment options , has shown encouraging growth and handled 171 million transactions valued at ₹ 1 trillion during the year .
IX.7 As part of the agenda for 2014-15 , it was planned that efforts would be made to provide a fillip to mobile banking and undertake necessary groundwork to put in place standards for customer on-boarding , security of transactions and redressal of customer grievances , besides engaging with stakeholders to explore the feasibility of having a standardised application for mobile banking across banks .
The Reserve Bank issued necessary guidelines to banks in December 2014 to enhance the usage of mobile banking in the country .
Banks were advised to provide their customers options for easy registration for mobile banking services , through multiple channels , including ATMs , thereby minimising the need for branch visit to avail such services .
Similarly , NPCI was advised with regard to setting standards for industry agreements between banks and mobile network operators ( MNOs ) for handling customer grievances , particularly in the context of the National Unified USSD ( Unstructured Supplementary Service Data ) Platform ( NUUP ) .
IX.8 In order to provide quick and efficient financing options for the micro , small and medium enterprises ( MSME ) segment , it was proposed to set up an electronic TReDS to bring together the MSME , their corporate buyers as well as financiers and reduce the constraints faced by the MSME segment in liquidity management .
The participants in the TReDS will be corporate buyers , including government departments and public sector undertakings ( PSUs ) .
The system will also facilitate factoring of both receivables as well as payables .
Accordingly , policy measures were taken towards setting up of TReDS .
Seven applications received to set up TReDS are being scrutinised for consideration of their authorisation during 2015-16 under the Payment and Settlement Systems ( PSS ) Act , 2007 .
IX.9 The guidelines for BBPS were issued in November 2014 as per the agenda for 2014-15 .
BBPS is being set up by NPCI as a pan-India integrated bill payment system under the PSS Act , 2007 offering inter-operable and accessible bill payment services to customers through a network of agents .
It is expected to address the problems faced by consumers who are required to use multiple options ( as put in place by respective billers ) to meet their bills payment requirements .
The process of authorisation of NPCI to act as a Bharat Bill Payment Central Unit ( BBPCU ) and authorisation of Bharat Bill Payment Operating Unit ( BBPOU ) will be completed during 2015-16 .
IX.10 The ECS suite and NACH provide similar services .
As envisaged in the agenda for 2014-15 , consolidation of these payment systems has commenced from December 2014 with migration of volume from the ECS suite to NACH and thus , almost all participants are on board in the NACH system .
IX.11 In line with the objective of the department to enhance greater acceptance of electronic payments , the following policy changes were introduced during the year .
IX.12 For ensuring availability of additional payment options , authorisation was issued to nine entities , increasing the number of authorised payment system operators to 63 in 2014-15 .
IX.13 With expanding infrastructure and service providers , it is equally important that they operate as per the norms set out by the Reserve Bank .
The Reserve Bank has accordingly devised an assessment template for retail payment systems .
Non-bank entities were asked to submit a self- assessment as per the template .
IX.14 Security and efficiency of payment system infrastructure being critical in development of payment systems , the NEFT platform was migrated to UNIX platform under the data centre architecture , which not only enhanced the processing capacity but also addressed the concerns of business continuity .
Similarly , in case of large value payment systems , activation of hybrid features in the revamped real time gross settlement ( RTGS ) system has facilitated the settlement of transactions on a gross basis as well as through multilateral off-setting .
Further , to enhance the efficiency and customer service aspects , acceptance of future value-dated transactions for settlement ( up to three business days ) has been activated , and the business hours of RTGS have been extended .
IX.15 With a view to mitigating certain risks in large value payment systems , the Clearing Corporation of India Limited ( CCIL ) took several initiatives .
CCIL migrated its USD-INR settlement of inter-bank forex transactions to a payment versus payment ( PvP ) mode in April 2015 addressing the Herstatt risk .
It has carried out the first cycle of portfolio compression in the forex forward segment , achieving a compression of about 62 per cent and thereby , reducing counterparty exposure .
IX.16 With the objective of ensuring convenience in the use of the payment system and also to facilitate the migration to electronic payments , the policy guidelines related to PPIs , mobile banking , usage of ATMs and additional factor of authentication ( AFA ) were amended .
AFA is a security process in which the user provides additional means of identification , one of which is typically a physical token , such as a card , and the other of which is typically something memorised , such as a security code .
The limit for full-KY C semi-closed PPIs was enhanced from ₹ 50,000 to ₹ 100,000 ; the validity of gift cards was increased from one year to three years ; banks were allowed to issue multiple PPIs for dependent family members from full-KYC compliant bank accounts .
In order to provide convenience to visiting foreign nationals and NRIs and also to reduce cash transactions emanating from this segment , banks were allowed to issue rupee denominated open system non-reloadable PPIs to visiting foreign nationals and NRIs during their stay in India , with the permissible ceiling on such PPIs being ₹ 200,000 with cash withdrawal restricted to ₹ 50,000 per month .
IX.18 The guidelines on WLAs were reviewed to allow for acceptance of international credit / debit / prepaid cards , besides the facility of dynamic Currency conversion ( DCC ) .WLA operators are now permitted to tie up with other commercial banks , besides the sponsor bank for supply of cash to the WLAs .
IX.19 Recognising the need for balancing aspects of security and convenience of card transactions , the requirement of AFA , which was earlier introduced for security of operations , was relaxed for small value card present transactions using contact-less EMV ( i.e. , Europay , Mastercard and Visa ) chip cards .
Banks have also been advised to put in place suitable velocity checks while at the same time clearly indicate the maximum liability , if any , devolving on the customer .
IX.20 Keeping in view the interoperable ATM infrastructure and the geographical dispersion of ATMs , the number of mandated free transactions at ATMs was rationalised in big cities .
The minimum number of free transactions for savings bank account holders at other bank ' s ATMs was reduced to three per month from five in six metro centres .
Further , banks were advised to provide their savings bank account holders with at least five free transactions per month at their own ATMs .
Beyond the mandatory free ATM transactions , banks were permitted to charge their customers up to a maximum of ₹ 20 ( plus service tax ) per transaction .
However , banks can put in place their own policies offering more number of free transactions at ATMs .
IX.21 A firm legal framework for payment systems is equally critical and hence , in conformity with the international standards , certain amendments to the PSS Act 2007 were introduced during the year .
IX.22 Following the global financial crisis , trade repositories ( TR ) and legal entity identifier ( LEI ) system have gained importance for strengthening the over the counter ( OTC ) derivatives markets .
Further , the functioning of a central counter party ( CCP ) and legal certainty in the event of its insolvency is critical .
In order to provide specific legal backing to close out netting in the event a CCP goes insolvent , as also for regulation and supervision of TR and local operating unit ( LOU - an entity issuing LEI ) by the Reserve Bank , after extensive deliberations by the Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha in which the Reserve Bank participated actively , amendments to the PSS Act , 2007 were carried out .
This provides legal backing / Clarity to various issues like close-out netting in the event of insolvency of a CCP ; regulating and supervising TR ; LOU under the LEI system ; and protection of customer funds for systems operated by authorised non-bank entities .
IX.23 In terms of focus areas in large value payment systems , efforts were directed at compliance with the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures ( PFMIs ) by Financial Market Infrastructures ( FMIs ) .
Towards this end , the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures- International Organisation of Securities Commissions ( CPMI-lOSCO ) which has been carrying out the Level 1 assessment against PFMIs , has rated the Indian jurisdiction as " " 4 " , " i.e. , final implementation measures are fully in force .
IX.24 The Reserve Bank organised an international seminar in November 2014 at Kovalam , Kerala , with a focus on the evolving role of central banks in retail payments , cash to cashless , role of non-banks in retail payments , innovations in retail payments , government payments and remittances , risk management and security and financial inclusion .
A ' Payment Systems Innovations Day ' was organised in December 2014 to provide a platform for presenting the various innovations taking place in payment systems .
The Reserve Bank hosted the 14th SEACEN Advanced Course on Payment and Settlement Systems for Emerging Economies during May 2015 with a special focus on ' Resilience of Payment Systems to Cyber Crime ' .
IX.25 The Reserve Bank would continue to encourage innovation in payment systems and play the role of a facilitator Keeping the focus on safety and efficiency of payment systems .
Given the fast changing payment landscape , the Reserve Bank will prepare a vision document for a 2 / 3 years horizon .
The work with respect to authorisation of entities for operating TReDS and BBPS will be completed in 2015-16 .
IX.26 In line with the endeavour to disincentivise cash transactions and incentivise card transactions , measures for enhancing card acceptance infrastructure by acquiring banks will be examined and policy framework on ATMs and cash at POS will be reviewed along with the interchange / merchant discount rate ( MDR ) structure in consultation with all the stakeholders .
IX.27 With the growing e-commerce segment in the country , the role of payment aggregators and intermediaries is also increasing significantly .
The Reserve Bank will engage with stakeholders to explore the need / feasibility of having a direct / indirect regulatory framework for these entities .
An assessment of RTGS against PFMIs would be undertaken in 2015-16 by the Reserve Bank .
IX.28 CCIL has been identified as LOU for issuing LEI and endorsed as pre-LOU by the Regulatory Oversight Committee ( ROC ) .
It has since commenced issuance of LEI in India .
A roadmap for use of LEI will be drawn in consultation with the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) .
IX.29 The department continued to focus on the Reserve Bank ' s IT vision of enabling the use of information technology ( IT ) as a strategic resource for bringing about overall efficiency in the Reserve Bank ' s operations , improving standards of services being provided to its customers , strengthening governance and facilitating analytical and information based decision making in a safe and secure IT based environment .

Follow up steps will also be taken in the light of the forthcoming report of the Committee to Review the Communication Policy of the Reserve Bank .
X.20 The Reserve Bank has a wide canvas of operations , requiring a robust set of internal capabilities to fulfill its mandate .
The human resource strategies and initiatives led by the Human Resource Management Department ( HRMD ) are , therefore , designed and developed as a two-way interface between the environment , the internal capacities , the setting of goals at the corporate level as well as at the department and functional levels .
X.21 In 2014-15 , organisational restructuring was carried out by the Reserve Bank following a cluster approach , that is , by clubbing closely related work areas to better serve the evolving financial sector ( Box X.2 ) .
The Reserve Bank has , in the recent past , been deliberating on a range of strategic considerations for adopting a more flexible and responsive organisational structure for enhanced performance in an increasingly dynamic business environment .
As part of this process , a Committee on Organisational Restructuring of the Reserve Bank ( Chairman : Shri Deepak Mohanty ; Co-Chairman : Shri B. Mahapatra ) was set up .
Broadly based on the recommendations of the committee and the outcomes of an elaborate internal consultative process , the organisational restructuring of the Reserve Bank was effected from November 3 , 2014 .
As part of the restructuring exercise , two new departments have been constituted in the Reserve Bank : ( i ) Department of Corporate Services , and ( ii ) International Department .
Monetary Policy Department ( MPD )
Human Resource Management Department ( HRMD )
Financial Markets Regulation Department ( FMRD )
Similarly the regional offices ( ROs ) of the Reserve Bank have been categorised into three tiers .
Tier-I or Metro ROs will now comprise of four offices of the Reserve Bank in Mumbai , New Delhi , Kolkata and Chennai .
Tier-II or Non-Metro ROs will comprise 14 ROs ; ( i ) Ahmedabad ; ( ii ) Bengaluru ; ( iii ) Bhopal ; ( iv ) Bhubaneswar ; ( v ) Chandigarh ; ( vi ) Guwahati ; ( vii ) Hyderabad ; ( viii ) Jaipur ; ( ix ) Jammu ; ( x ) Kanpur ; ( xi ) Lucknow ; ( xii ) Nagpur ; ( xiii ) Patna ; and ( xiv ) Thiruvananthapuram .
Six training establishments of the Reserve Bank catered to its training requirements ( Table X.2 ) .
The restructured ROs depending on size and volume of work will have the following clusters : Tier I and II will have four clusters : ( i ) Supervision , Market Intelligence and Research ; ( ii ) Currency and Banking Services ; ( iii ) Financial Inclusion and Customer Service ; and ( iv ) Human Resources Management ( HRM ) and Infrastructure .
Further , a number of Class III and Class IV employees were trained in external institutions in India .
X.24 Under the Golden Jubilee Scholarship Scheme , six officers were selected to pursue higher studies in reputed universities abroad .
Ten officers availed study leave under different schemes for pursuing higher studies during the year .
Further , 599 employees pursued select part time / distance education courses under the Reserve Bank ' s incentive scheme .
X.25 Towards promoting research , training and consultancy in the banking and financial sector , the Reserve Bank provided financial support of ₹ 300 million to the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research ( IGIDR ) , Mumbai ; ₹ 140 million to the Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning ( CAFRAL ) , Mumbai ; ₹ 18.4 million to the National Institute of Bank Management ( NIBM ) , Pune ; ₹ 6.9 million to the Indian Institute of Bank Management ( IIBM ) , Guwahati ; and ₹ 10 million to the London School of Economics ( LSE ) India observatory and the IG Patel Chair .
X.26 Almost 5,000 schools and 10,000 students participated in RBIQ 2014 , an all-India inter-school quiz launched by the Reserve Bank in 2012 .
It was held at 62 different locations all over India .
The zonal and national finals were conducted in Mumbai and telecast on Doordarshan ' s National Channel .
Periodic meetings were held with recognised associations of officers and employees / workmen on various issues relating to service conditions and welfare of employees .
However , the government had observed that the improvements in the pension scheme could not be effected without suitably amending Regulation 2 ( 2 ) of the RBI Pension Regulations , 1990 and requested the Reserve Bank for their withdrawal .
In October 2008 , these improvements in monthly pension were withdrawn by the Central Board .
This was , however , challenged in the High Court of Judicature in Bombay , where the Hon ' ble High Court set aside the Reserve Bank ' s circular regarding withdrawal of improvements .
Since then , there has been persistent demand from all the pensioners / retirees for improvements in pensions .
However , the matter remains unresolved till date , though the Reserve Bank and the Government are fully engaged with the issue .
X.29 With the recruitment of 784 employees in 2014 , the total staff strength as on December 31 , 2014 , stood at 16,794 as compared with 17,360 a year ago , the category-wise details of which are presented in Tables X.4 and X.5.
X.30 The Reserve Bank ' s management and representatives of the All India Reserve Bank Scheduled Castes / Scheduled Tribes and the Buddhist Federation met on four occasions in 2014 to discuss issues relating to the implementation of reservation policy in the Reserve Bank .
The total number of Other Backward Classes ( OBCs ) ( recruited after September 1993 ) in the Reserve Bank as on December 31 , 2014 , stood at 1,870 , of which 533 were in Class I , 604 in Class III and 733 in Class IV .
X.33 A new comprehensive set of guidelines was issued in 2014-15 in accordance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace ( Prohibition , Prevention and Redressal ) Act and Rules , 2013 .
The guidelines prescribe , among others , strict timelines for handling complaints and bestow Significant powers , including levy of penalty to internal complaints committees .
While no sexual harassment complaints were received in the Reserve Bank in 2014 , awareness / orientation programmes at periodic intervals were conducted to sensitise staff / members of complaint committees on the legal provisions and the Reserve Bank ' s new guidelines in the matter .

X.36 Key Result Area ( KRA ) -based PMS is in vogue from 2013-14 coupled with a ranking model from the first cycle of review .
Further , job profiles across work areas are being compiled for identifying required competencies , developing these competencies and standardising for similar positions across regional offices .
The job profiles for senior officers will be finalised by September 2015 and for officers in Grade ' B ' and ' C ' by March 2016 .
X.37 The Reserve Bank ' s Senior Management Retreat for 2014 was held in Mussoorie with the broad theme , ' RBI @ 80 : Looking Back , Looking Ahead ' .
As part of inter-institutional arrangement for knowledge sharing , a joint international seminar , ' Financial Stability : Issues and Concerns ' was held in collaboration with the European Central Bank ( ECB ) at the College of Agricultural Banking , Pune in May 2015 .
X.38 Taking forward the efforts to evaluate Capabilities available within the organisation , HRMD plans to work in 2015-16 on all associated HR areas like recruitment , placement mechanisms , fine- tuning the internal processes post organisational restructuring , talent spotting , talent management and continuous capacity building .
X.39 The Reserve Bank plans to set up an Academy as a residential facility with state-of-the- art infrastructure in Navi Mumbai , primarily for integrated learning and development of its staff including e-learning .
Going forward , the Academy will also conduct training for foreign central banks including those from South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) and other regions to promote external cooperation and cross learning .
Therefore , a functional and behavioural competency set for each job role needs to be assessed coupled with the evaluation of competencies of the available human resources .
Assessment centres will be set up for assessing the behavioural competency mapping of the staff .
In the first phase , e-learning modules will primarily be umbrella courses targeted at larger groups of staff members and specific courses positioned as complementary to classroom courses .
In addition , webinars will be used for wider dissemination of knowledge .
For this purpose , a new scheme of selection is being framed in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India Services Board and the Institute of Banking Personnel Selection .
The recruitment cycle is expected to shorten with the forthcoming new scheme of selection .
X.43 The adoption of the Enterprise-wide Risk Management ( ERM ) framework in February 2012 by the Reserve Bank marked a move from a ' silo- based ' approach to a ' whole-of-business ' perspective to risk management .
Accordingly , the Risk Monitoring Department ( RMD ) envisaged a three- phased ERM rollout plan for the Reserve Bank .
X.44 As per the three-lines-of-defence approach to ERM adopted by the Reserve Bank , the Business Areas ( BAS ) represent the first line of defence as the BAs identify and manage their respective risks , while the Risk Monitoring Department ( RMD ) as the second line supports all BAs in the identification of significant risks , formulates risk policies , provides a risk assessment methodology , reports the risks to the Risk Governance Structure ( RGS ) and works to foster a risk culture in the Reserve Bank ( Box X.3 ) .
Finally , the Internal Audit function which constitutes the third line of defence provides risk assurance to RGS through the risk-based audit process .
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision defines operational risk ( OR ) as ' the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes , people and systems or from external events ' .
Central banks too are exposed to operational risks and , being risk-sensitive institutions , closely monitor their actual and potential operational risk exposures .
However , there are no international benchmarks for monitoring operational risks in central banks .
The International Operational Risk Working Group ( IORWG ) of over 61 central banks , including the Reserve Bank of India and the Bank for International Settlements acts as a centre of competence on Operational Risk Management ( ORM ) .
The ORM framework adopted by most of the central banks typically includes a risk assessment methodology , risk repositories and heat map ( s ) , apart from incident reporting systems and periodic risk surveys .
Risk assessment methodology generally uses a combination of the likelihood of occurrence and severity of impact of a risk event to rate its riskiness on a graduated scale ( say , high , significant or acceptable ) .
The likelihood of occurrence of a risk event could be derived from both quantitative and qualitative factors .
The impact of occurrence of an operational risk event on an organisation could be classified as financial impact , disruption in business operations / customer service , ( negative ) impact on reputation of the entity , or a combination of any of the three .
This will be reinforced by providing a computerised environment for risk monitoring to enable access to a risk database by Business Areas .
Also , work is underway for implementing a consistent approach to rating of risks in the Reserve Bank .
Risk surveys will continue to be used as a tool for identification and monitoring of emerging risks in Business Areas as well as for the Reserve Bank as a whole .
Five of the identified BAs have completed the Risk Registers and work is in progress in 27 other BAs .
A vigorous risk management awareness campaign for strengthening the risk culture in the Reserve Bank was initiated during the year .
X.46 A draft Economic Capital Framework ( ECF ) for the Reserve Bank was formulated during the year to assess the Reserve Bank ' s capital and internal reserves position in a structured and systematic manner ( Box X.4 ) .
The public policy mandate of central banks makes the context of their risk management materially different from that of commercial entities , and necessitates the focus of their risk management to be on preserving and facilitating their policy efficacy , rather than profit maximisation .
This principle of ' policy predominance ' in pursuit of public interest often requires central banks to assume considerable financial risks on their balance sheets .
For instance , the Reserve Bank of India maintains national forex reserves , constituting almost three-fourth of its balance sheet , in fulfilling its core purpose of fostering confidence in the external value of the rupee .
While the reserves do buffer the country against external shocks , they also expose the Reserve Bank to considerable exchange rate risks .
A central bank ' s role in fostering monetary and financial stability also exposes it to a wider range of risks , including losses arising from market interventions , lender of last resort ( LOLR ) role , market maker of last resort ( MMLR ) role and quasi-fiscal operations .
Importantly , these mandates can at times require central banks to adopt a counter-intuitive approach to risk and assume increased risk on to their balance sheet , during times of systemic financial stress in order to de-risk the financial system .
A central bank ' s risks can be substantial and , consequently , its losses are neither as rare nor insignificant as is usually assumed .
In the recent period , while a number of central banks in developed economies have suffered losses , central banks in emerging / developing economies suffered losses through the 1980s and 1990s also .
Interestingly , this happened despite the seigniorage income accruing all along to these central banks , which is an important source of their financial strength .
Given these unique challenges , the general approach towards financial risk management in central banks is that while they do not actively manage risks arising from policy actions , they seek to ensure that their balance sheets have sufficient financial resilience to absorb these risks .
Thus , they maintain sufficient economic capital , supplemented by risk-transfer / dividend-smoothening mechanisms .
Central banks as providers of domestic liquidity require capital not to remain going concerns but to ensure policy efficacy and credibility with regard to the ability to achieve their objectives .
Weak finances can move central banks to either rely on generating excessive seigniorage income , which may come in conflict with their price-stability objective , or seek recapitalisation from the government , which could impact their autonomy .
The capital requirements of a central bank can vary considerably depending on a number of factors , inter alia : The size of shocks and scope of a central bank ' s mandate : The wider the area of responsibilities of a central bank , greater the risks and , hence , higher the requirement of capital .
The accounting policy framework adopted by central banks : Central banks which periodically recognise changes in valuation of assets will see greater variability in their financial positions , which increases capital requirements .
Institutional arrangements : Statutory provisions for a central bank ' s recapitalisation as well as risk transfer mechanisms can reduce its capital requirements , though not eliminate them .
The fiscal space available with the sovereign : A central bank may require recapitalisation , precisely at a time when the fiscal position is under strain , say , due to a financial crisis .
The European Central Bank and the central banks of Australia , Austria , Belgium , France , Finland , Germany , Italy , Netherlands , Norway , New Zealand , Singapore and Sweden use methodologies , such as value-at-risk , expected shortfall , stress tests and other risk models to determine their adequacy of reserves / risk provisions .
The central bank of New Zealand has in place a well-developed economic capital framework to model its capital requirements .
The exercise is a challenging one as the Reserve Bank plans to cover not only the risks in its balance sheet but also its ' contingent risks ' which arise from its public policy role in fostering monetary and financial stability .
X.47 In the coming year , ECF is expected to be refined and implemented in the Reserve Bank .
RAF , which is under development , is also planned for induction .
The finalisation of risk registers of all BAs will bring out the risk profile / neat map of each BA , regional office and the organisation as a whole .
The Incident Reporting System will help identify patterns across incidents with a view to effectively preventing / managing such events in the future .
Risk surveys will be conducted to support the monitoring of the emerging risks as also to review top risks .
Efforts for creating risk awareness at all levels and across all locations will continue to be pursued for deepening the risk culture in the organisation .
X.48 Internal audit / inspection undertaken by the Inspection Department of the Reserve Bank examines and reports on the adequacy and reliability of its risk management , internal controls and governance processes under a robust risk based internal audit ( RBIA ) framework and provides regular feedback to the Audit and Risk Management Sub-Committee ( ARMS ) of the Central Board .

The increase on the liability side was mainly due to a rise in notes in circulation and deposits . As on June 30 , 2015 domestic assets ( including gold ) constituted 26.07 per cent while the FCA constituted 73.93 per cent of total assets as against 33.0 per cent and 67.0 per cent , respectively as on June 30 , 2014 .
XI.3 As in the previous year , no amount has been transferred to the Contingency Fund .
An amount of ₹ 10.00 billion has been provided for and transferred to the Asset Development Fund specifically towards capital contribution to the National Housing Bank ( NHB ) and the surplus of ₹ 658.96 billion has been transferred to the Central Government .
The balances in the Contingency Fund and the Asset Development Fund and the surplus transferred to the Central Government during the last five years have been given in Tables XI.1 & XI.2 respectively .
A Technical Committee constituted in 2012-13 to review the Form of Presentation of the Balance Sheet and Profit & Loss Account [ Chairman : Shri Y.H. Malegam ( Technical Committee I ) ] had made several recommendations relating to the format and contents of the Balance Sheet and Profit & Loss Account of the Reserve Bank and also to change the nomenclature of the Profit and Loss Account to Income Statement .
@ For 2014-15 not shown as it is included in total expenditure .
In order to effect the change relating to the format and contents of the Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account , Government of India has notified the format of weekly accounts of the Bank on July 15 , 2015 in the Gazette of India and amendments in relevant sections of RBI General Regulations , 1949 have been notified by the Bank on July 6 and July 15 , 2015 in the Gazette of India for changes in the format of the Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account of the Bank .
Accordingly , the accounts of the Bank for the year 2014-15 have been drawn up in the new format .
XI.5 The major changes in the format and contents of the Balance Sheet and the Profit and Loss account are as under : Balance Sheets of Issue and Banking Departments have been merged and each item of asset and liability is shown as line items Supported by schedules .
'Gold Coin and Bullion ' which earlier formed part of ' Other Assets ' , and ' Investment in Subsidiaries and Associates ' , which formed part of ' Investments ' in the Banking Department balance sheet , are now shown as distinct balance sheet heads .
The Profit and Loss Account has been renamed as ' Income Statement ' and the income head has been bifurcated into two major sub heads viz . ' Interest ' and ' Others ' supported by schedules .
A new head ' Provisions ' has been added under expenditure for accounting of transfers to the Contingency Fund ( CF ) and the Asset Development Fund ( ADF ) .
The unit of reporting has been changed from ' Rupee Thousands ' to ' Rupee billions ' .
X1.6 For better readability and presentation , investments have been bifurcated into four major categories .
'Balances Held Abroad ' and ' Investments ' held as part of Banking Department balance sheet are shown as ' Investments-Foreign-BD ' and ' Investments- Domestic-BD ' , respectively .
'Foreign Securities ' and ' Gol Rupee Securities ' forming part of ' Issue Department Assets ' have been shown as ' Investments- Foreign-ID ' and ' Investments- Domestic-ID ' respectively .
Contingency Reserve and Asset Development Reserve have been renamed as ' Contingency Fund ' and ' Asset Development Fund ' .
Repo and Reverse Repo transactions , were earlier treated as purchase and sale of securities .
As the substance of the transaction is lending and deposit of funds and securities only represent the collateral for the transaction , Repo under Liquidity Adjustment Facility ( LAF ) and Marginal Standing Facility ( MSF ) is now being treated as lending and Reverse Repo being treated as deposit of funds with RBI .
The Technical Committee I had also recommended that rupee securities be carried at fair value and any unrealised gain or loss may be transferred to the Investment Revaluation Account ( IRA ) .
This will be implemented in 2015-16 .
XI.8 Another Technical Committee [ Chairman : Shri Y.H.Malegam ( Technical Committee II ) ] was constituted during 2013-14 to review the Level and Adequacy of Internal Reserves and Surplus Distribution Policy of the Reserve Bank of India .
Based on the recommendations of the Technical Committee II , the forward contracts entered into by the Bank as part of its intervention operations are being marked to market on yearly basis as on the balance sheet date from the year 2013-14 .
Further , as against the earlier policy of ignoring gain and accounting for loss only , now both gain or loss are accounted for .
These funds are maintained by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development ( NABARD ) .
Management is responsible for the preparation of these financial statements that give a true and correct view of the state of affairs and results of operations of the Bank in accordance with the requirements of the provisions of the Reserve Bank of India Act , 1934 and Regulations framed thereunder and the accounting policies and practices followed by the Bank .

An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by management , as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements .
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion .
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to explanations given to us and as shown by the books of account of the Bank , the Balance Sheet read with Significant Accounting Policies is a full and fair Balance Sheet containing all necessary particulars and is properly drawn up in accordance with the requirements of the provisions of the Reserve Bank of India Act , 1934 and Regulations framed there under so as to exhibit true and correct view of the state of affairs of the Bank .

The rupee equivalent is determined on the basis of the exchange rate prevailing on the last business day of the month .
Unrealised gains / losses are credited / debited to the Currency and Gold Revaluation Account ( CGRA ) .
All foreign currency assets and liabilities ( excluding foreign currency received under the swaps that are in the nature of repos and contracts where the rates are fixed contractually ) are translated at the exchange rates prevailing on the last business day of the week / month / year as applicable .

Debit balance , if any , at the end of the year in IRA is required to be charged to the Contingency Fund and the same is to be reversed to the credit of the Contingency Fund on the first working day of the succeeding financial year .
Till 2013 -14 , the policy was to charge such debit balance in the IRA to the Profit and Loss Account .
Foreign Treasury Bills and Commercial Papers are carried atcostas adjusted by amortisation of discount .
Premium or discount on foreign securities is amortised daily .
Profit / loss on sale of foreign currency assets is recognised with respect to the book value .
On sale / redemption of foreign dated securities valuation gain / loss in respect of the securities sold , lying in IRA , is transferred to the Income account .
Forward contracts entered into by the Reserve Bank as part of its intervention operations are revalued on a yearly basis on June 30 .
While the marked to market gain is credited to the ' Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts Valuation Account ' ( FCVA ) with contra debit to Revaluation of Forward Contracts Account ( RFCA ) , marked to market loss is debited to the FCVA with contra credit to the Provision for Forward Contracts Valuation Account ( PFCVA ) .
Debit balance in FCVA , if any , on June 30 , is required to be charged to the Contingency Fund and reversed on the first working day of the following year .
On maturity of the contract , the actual gain or loss is required to be recognised in the Income Account and the unrealised gains / losses previously recorded in the FCVA , RFCA and PFCVA are required to be reversed .

The amounts recorded in the SAA are reversed on maturity of the underlying contracts .
Further , the amounts received under these swaps are not subject to periodic revaluation .
While FCVA and PFCVA form part of ' Other Liabilities ' , RFCA and SAA form part of ' Other Assets ' .
Rupee securities , held as part of Bank ' s domestic investments , are valued at lower of book value or market value ( LOBOM ) .
Where the market price for such securities is not available , the rates are derived based on the yield curve prevailing on the last business day of the month as notified by the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India ( FIMMDA ) .
Non- interest bearing rupee securities held as backing for note issue and securities which are earmarked against funds , such as , Gratuity and Superannuation , Provident Fund , Leave Encashment , Medical Assistance Fund , and Depositors ' Education and Awareness ( DEA ) Fund are , however , categorised as held to maturity ( HTM ) and therefore not marked to market .
Investments in shares are valued at cost .
From the year 2014-15 onwards Repo under LAF and Marginal Standing Facility ( MSF ) is being treated as lending and is being shown under ' Loans and Advances ' whereas ' Reverse Repo ' is being treated as deposits and is being shown under ' Deposit-Others ' .

The paid-up capital continues to be ₹ 0.05 billion as per section 4 of the Reserve Bank of India Act , 1934 .
The original Reserve Fund of ₹ 0.05 billion was created in terms of section 46 of the Reserve Bank of India Act , 1934 as contribution from the Central Government for the currency liability of the then sovereign government taken over by the Reserve Bank .
The fund has been static since then and gain / loss on account of valuation of gold and foreign currency is booked in the Currency and Gold Revaluation Account ( CGRA ) which is part of the balance sheet head ' Other Liabilities ' and provisions .
This includes National Industrial Credit ( Long Term Operations ) Fund and National Housing Credit ( Long Term Operations ) Fund .
This fund was created in July 1964 , under section 46C of the Reserve Bank of India Act , 1934 with an initial corpus of ₹ 100 million .
The fund witnessed annual contributions from the Reserve Bank for financial assistance to eligible financial institutions .
Since 1992-93 , a token amount of ₹ 10 million is being contributed each year to the Fund from the Bank ' s income .
This fund was set up in January 1989 under section 46D of the Reserve Bank of India Act , 1934 for extending financial accommodation to the National Housing Bank .
From the year 1992-93 , only a token amount of ₹ 10 million is contributed each year from the Bank ' s income .
There are two other Funds constituted under section 46A of the Reserve Bank of India Act , 1934 viz . , National Rural Credit ( Long Term Operations ) Fund and National Rural Credit ( Stabilisation ) Fund which are maintained by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development ( NABARD ) for which a token amount of ₹ 10 million each is transferred to NABARD every year .
These represent the balances maintained with the Reserve Bank by banks , the Central and State Governments , All India Financial Institutions , such as , Export Import Bank of India ( EXIM Bank ) and NABARD , Foreign Central Banks , International Financial Institutions , balance in different accounts relating to the Employees ' Provident Fund , and balance in the Depositors ' Education and Awareness Fund ( DEA Fund ) .
DEA Fund was created in the year 2013-14 for promotion of depositors ' interest and for such other related purposes .
Total deposits stood at ₹ 5,186.86 billion as on June 30 , 2015 as compared with ₹ 3,769.45 billion as on June 30 , 2014 , registering an increase of 37.60 per cent .
The Reserve Bank acts as banker to the central government in terms of sections 20 and 21 and as banker to the state governments by mutual agreement in terms of section 21 ( A ) of the Reserve Bank of India Act , 1934 .
Accordingly , the central and the state governments maintain deposits with the Reserve Bank .
The balances held by the central and state governments were ₹ 1.01 billion and ₹ 0.43 billion respectively as on June 30 , 2015 , totalling ₹ 1.44 billion .
Banks maintain balances in their current accounts with the Reserve Bank to provide for the Cash Reserve Ratio ( CRR ) requirements and for working funds to meet payment and settlement obligations .
The amount of deposits in the current account of banks as on June 30 , 2015 stood at ₹ 3,946.85 billion as compared with ₹ 3,677.24 billion as on June 30 , 2014 , registering an increase of 7.33 per cent during the year .

From 2014- 15 , Reverse Repo transactions are being treated as deposit of funds with the Bank and therefore the outstanding Reverse Repo now forms part of ' Deposit-Others ' .
The amount under Deposits-Others increased by 1264.21 per cent from ₹ 90.79 billion as on June 30 , 2015 ₹ 1,238.57 billion as on June 30 , 2015 primarily due to amounts held by the Bank under reverse repo transactions .
The major components of ' Other Liabilities and Provisions ' are provisions under different heads and Gratuity and Superannuation Fund .
Till 2013-14 balances held in Gratuity and Superannuation Funds were shown under ' Deposits ' -Others ' .
While Contingency Fund and Asset Development Fund represent provisions made for unforeseen contingencies and internal capital expenditure respectively , the remaining components of ' Other Liabilities and Provisions ' , such as , Currency and Gold revaluation account ( CGRA ) , Investment Revaluation Account ( IRA ) and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts Valuation Account ( FCVA ) , represent unrealised marked to market gains / losses .
Other Liabilities and Provisions declined by 0.63 per cent from ₹ 8,961.70 billion as on June 30 , 2014 to ₹ 8,905.03 billion as on June 30 , 2015 , primarily due to decline in the balance held in CGRA .
The Asset Development Fund ( formerly Asset Development Reserve ) created in 1997-98 , represents the amounts provided out of income each year to meet internal capital expenditure and make investments in subsidiaries and associated institutions .
During the year , there has been an addition of ₹ 10 billion to provide for further investment as capital in the National Housing Bank .
Following the best international practices , unrealised gains / losses on valuation of Foreign Currency Assets ( FCA ) and Gold are not taken to the Income Account but instead recorded under a balance sheet head named as the Currency and Gold Revaluation Account ( CGRA ) .
CGRA represents accumulated net balance of unrealised gains arising out of valuation of FCA and Gold and , therefore , its balance varies with the size of the asset base , movement in the exchange rate and price of gold .
During 2014-15 , the 2.27 per cent from ₹ 5,721.63 billion as on June 30 , 2014 to ₹ 5,591.93 billion as on June 30 , 2015 mainly due to appreciation of US Dollar against other major currencies and fall in the price of Gold .
The foreign dated securities are marked to market on the last business day of each month and the unrealised gains / losses arising therefrom are transferred to the IRA .
MTM of outstanding forward contracts as on June 30 , 2015 resulted in a net loss of ₹ 0.39 billion , which was debited to the FCVA with contra credit to the PFCVA .
As per the extant policy , the debit balance of ₹ 0.39 billion in FCVA was adjusted against the Contingency Fund on June 30 , 2015 and reversed on July 1 , 2015 . Accordingly , the balance in FCVA and PFCVA as on June 30 , 2015 was nil and ₹ 0.39 billion respectively , as against a balance of ₹ .42.98 billion and nil respectively as on June 30 , 2014 .
The position of balances in CGRA , IRA , FCVA and PFCVA for the last five years is given in Table XI.3.

Under Section 48 of the Reserve Bank Act , 1934 the Bank is not liable to pay income tax or Super tax or any other tax on any of its income , profits or gains and is also exempt from payment of wealth tax .
Accordingly , after adjusting expenditure , the contribution of an amount of ₹ 0.04 billion to the statutory funds , and necessary provisions , the surplus transferable to the Government of India for the year 2014-15 amounted to ₹ 658.96 billion , ( including ₹ 11.46 billion as against ₹ 12.69 billion in the previous year payable towards the difference in interest expenditure borne by the Government consequent on conversion of special securities into marketable securities ) .
The Reserve Bank provides remittance facilities for its constituents and also meets its own payments requirements through issue of Demand Drafts ( DDs ) and Payment Orders ( POs ) ( besides electronic payments mechanisms ) .
The balance under this head represents the unclaimed DDs / POs .
This is a residual category representing items such as interest earned on earmarked securities , amounts payable on leave encashment , etc .
Till 2013-14 this category included margin maintained on Repo transactions , which has since been discontinued following the change in accounting treatment of Repo under LAF and MSF .
The liabilities of the Issue Department reflect the quantum of currency notes in circulation .
Section 34 ( I ) of the Reserve Bank of India Act requires that all bank notes issued by the Reserve Bank since April 1 , 1935 and the currency notes issued by the Government of India before the commencement of operations of the Reserve Bank be part of the liabilities of the Issue Department .
The currency notes in circulation increased by 9.57 per cent from ₹ 13,445.16 billion June 30 , 2014 to ₹ 14,732.43 billion as on June 30 , 2015 .

XI.13 The main components of Reserve Bank ' s income are Interest Receipts and Others including ( i ) Discount , ( ii ) Exchange , ( iii ) Commission and ( iv ) Rent Realised , Profit or loss on sale of Bank ' s property and provisions no longer required .
Of these , Interest receipts forms the major portion , supplemented by relatively small amounts of income from other sources , viz . , discount , exchange , commission and others .
XI.15 The net income from domestic sources increased by 19.29 per cent from ₹ 448.49 billion in 2013-14 to ₹ 535.00 billion in 2014-15 , mainly on account of lower depreciation on rupee securities as the prices of Government securities stayed in a narrow range throughout the year .
The substantial decline in depreciation by ₹ 382.17 billion was offset to a large extent by lower profits realised on sales of securities as the central government is now being compensated based on the weighted average rate of the term auctions conducted by the Reserve Bank during the year as against the earlier system of investing in government securities from out of the Bank ' s holdings .
The details of earnings from domestic sources are given in Table XI.9.
XI.16 The coupon receipts was slightly lower at ₹ 436.30 billion in 2014-15 as compared to ₹ 470.53 billion as the Reserve Bank ' s holding of rupee securities came down on account of Open Market Operations ( OMO ) sales ( including the sales on NDS-OM ) and redemption of securities on maturity .
No OMO purchases were conducted during the year .
XI.17 The net interest income from LAF and MSF ( Interest on Repo and MSF less interest paid by the Bank on Reverse Repo ) decreased by 60.53 per cent from ₹ 76.47 billion in 2013-14 to ₹ 30.17 billion in 2014-15 largely on account of lower Average Daily Net Liquidity Injection through RBI windows ( Repo , Reverse Repo , MSF , Term Repo & Term Reverse Repo ) .
This is attributable to significantly higher daily average utilisation of WMA / OD / SDF by the States at ₹ 14.46 billion in 2014-15 as against ₹ 8.51 billion during 2013-14 .
XI.19 The Reserve Bank incurs expenditure in the course of performing its statutory functions by way of agency charges / commission , printing of notes , expenses on remittance of treasure besides staff related and other expenses .
The total expenditure of the Reserve Bank increased by 11.92 per cent from ₹ 119.34 billion in 2013-14 to ₹ 133.56 billion in 2014-15 .

The employee cost decreased by 6.15 per cent from ₹ 43.24 billion in 2013-14 to ₹ 40.58 billion in 2014-15 .
The major component of employee cost is gratuity and superannuation .
The decrease is mainly due to the decrease in the contribution towards accrued liabilities of the Gratuity and Superannuation Fund and other funds based on the actuarial valuation .
The contribution for the year 2014-15 was ₹ 14.83 billion as against ₹ 18.09 billion in the previous year .
Gol dated rupee securities , equivalent to the balances in Provident Fund , Gratuity & Superannuation Fund , Leave Encashment Fund and Medical Assistance Fund , held by the Bank have been specifically ear-marked for these Funds .
The Reserve Bank discharges the function of banker to the government through a large network of agency bank branches that serve as retail outlets for government transactions .
Underwriting commission was on the lower side as compared to last year due to softening of yields during the year ( 10 year benchmark yield decreased by around 86 bps ) on account of various reasons like RBI rate cut by 75 bps , softening of crude prices ; fall in CPl and WPI etc .
Other expenses consisting of expenditure on remittance of treasure , printing and stationery , audit fees and related expenses , miscellaneous expenses , etc. increased by 39.74 per cent from ₹ 10.67 billion as on June 30 , 2014 to ₹ 14.91 billion as on June 30 , 2015 .
XI.20 Figures for the previous year have been rearranged to make them comparable with the Current year .
XI.21 The statutory auditors of the Bank are appointed by the Central Government in terms of Section 50 of the RBI Act , 1934 .
The accounts of the Reserve Bank for the year 2014-15 were audited by M / s Haribhakti & Co . LLP , Mumbai and M / s CNK & Associates LLP , Mumbai as the Statutory Central Auditors and M / s M Choudhury and Co . , M / s Sundaram & Srinivasan and M / s V K Verma & Co. as Statutory Branch Auditors .
Economic activity picked up pace and the trajectory of growth was underpinned by macroeconomic stability embodied in narrowing fiscal and current account deficits and ebbing inflation .
Domestic financial markets exhibited differential responses to episodic shifts in risk sentiment on global spillovers , with money and bond markets remaining relatively sheltered .
In the first quarter of 2016-17 , global risks intensified after remaining dormant in the aftermath of the turbulence that roiled global financial markets in January .
The Brexit referendum initially shocked financial markets , producing overshoots and misalignments of asset prices and frantic churns of capital , but gave way to a reach for returns as an uneasy calm returned .
These financial perturbations are increasingly taking a knock-on toll on real activity in advanced and emerging economies and present the biggest risk to their near-term outlook .
1.2 In this turbulent setting , underlying conditions have been firming up in India for scaling up the growth momentum .
Progress of the southwest monsoon augurs well for agriculture and the rural economy .
The seventh pay commission award may provide a stimulus to consumption spending within the targeted fiscal deficit through the multiplier effects of government consumption expenditure .
On the external front , India became a preferred destination for foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , receiving the highest annual net inflow in 2015-16 .
Indicators of external sustainability recorded a distinct improvement during the year .
Elsewhere , however , particularly in the industrial sector , considerable slack and _ sluggishness continues to weigh upon the outlook .
The capex cycle remains weak and private investment activity is listless .
Evenas the banking sector deals with high stress emanating from deterioration in corporate balance sheets and , therefore , loan quality , efforts have to be redoubled to free up credit flows to the productive sectors of the economy so that growth is supported .
Alongside , perseverance ' with disinflation towards the medium-term CPI inflation goal of 4 per cent under a new monetary policy framework , anchoring states to high quality fiscal consolidation and concerted efforts to reverse the erosion of productivity and competitiveness will assume importance as the ambit of structural reforms widens .
While the Reserve Bank of India ' s accounting year is July-June , data on a number of variables are available on a financial year basis , i.e. , April-March , and hence , the data are analysed on the basis of the financial year .
Where available , the data have been updated beyond March 2016 .
For the purpose of analysis and for providing proper perspective on policies , reference to past years as also prospective periods , wherever necessary , has been made in this Report .
1.3 Looking back at the year gone by , private consumption remained the mainstay of the modest acceleration in real GDP growth , as in 2014-15 .
Fixed investment and exports were the missing drivers .
Nonetheless , the sustained improvement in households ' financial saving since 2013-14 has been a noteworthy development .
The ongoing disinflation is freeing up real incomes , and interest rates - especially on small savings - turned positive in real terms .
The significant improvement in corporate profitability , essentially on account of saving on input costs and more recently on sales growth , is expected to boost corporate saving and translate into investment spending going forward .
Record inflows of foreign direct investment and the surge of initial public offerings after a four-year lull seem to be providing lead indications of this tipping point .
1.4 On the production side , agriculture weathered two consecutive years of drought conditions and posted modest growth in contrast to the contraction a year ago .
This resilience , aided by astute supply management , smoothed breaks in availability of farm output and restrained food price pressures .
Industrial output slowed down in relation to a year ago , despite a turnaround in consumer durables .
Consumer non-durables posted a decline after six years of expansion , mainly on account of contraction / deceleration in fast moving consumer goods which , in turn , reflected the subdued state of rural demand .
Going forward , the improvement expected in agricultural activity could reverse this deterioration and boost rural incomes .
A sustained turnaround in capital goods output would , however , await a revival of investment demand .
In the services sector , a deceleration was evident across all constituents as new business orders slowed and exports were impacted by weak external demand .
1.5 In the infrastructure space , electricity generation reached 98 per cent of the annual target , with the highest ever annual capacity addition in the solar and wind energy segments .
Seventeen states have given in-principle approval / joined the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana ( UDAY ) .
The hope is that as the DISCOMs become debt-lite , their financial and operating efficiency will improve and the slack in demand will progressively decline .
However , continuing efforts in these directions , including on enhancing collections and reducing line losses , are needed .
In the road sector , there was significant improvement in terms of new constructions , especially in the national highway network .
Notable progress was also achieved in railways in terms of capital investment , commissioning of broad gauged lines and electrification of railway tracks .
Major ports in India , especially private ports , also recorded the highest ever capacity addition in a single year .
1.6 Benign inflation conditions prevailing until August 2015 were dispelled by the sustained elevation in prices of pulses .
Consequently , inflation picked up from September and rose month after month till January 2016 , albeit remaining below the target of 6 per cent set for that month .
In the ensuing three months , inflation eased on the back of the seasonal decline in prices of fruits and vegetables but picked up again from May 2016 as food prices firmed up ahead of the onset of the monsoon .
An unusually high and protracted demand for currency drove up the expansion of reserve money and muted the money multiplier which , in turn , moderated the rate of money supply .
Bank credit was generally sluggish in the first half of the year , reflecting lacklustre demand in the economy , asset quality concerns , the ongoing deleveraging through write-offs , recoveries and upgradations , and some amount of disintermediation in favour of relatively cheaper source of funds outside the banking system .
In the second half of the year , however , bank credit growth picked up in the retail segment and also to industry and agriculture .
Timely recognition of the deterioration in banks ' balance sheets through the Reserve Bank ' s asset quality review resulted in the overall stressed assets ratio rising marginally by end-March 2016 from its level a year ago , with a rise in the gross NPA ratio but a fall in the restructured assets ratio .
Banks ' profitability was affected by provisioning requirements .
Going forward , the stage is set for continued efforts to declog the banking system and enable credit to flow to productive sectors .
1.8 With the fiscal deficit declining to 3.9 per cent of GDP , central finances were revenue-driven in 2015-16 - additional revenue mobilisation through cesses ; duty revisions in respect of petrol and diesel ; higher dividend and profits ; and earnings from spectrum auctions .
Significantly , there were no cutbacks to budgeted capital expenditure .
By contrast , states overshot the budgeted deficit , mainly on account of shortfall in revenues .
1.9 In the external sector , a faster pace of contraction in imports relative to exports and large terms of trade gains narrowed the current account deficit to 1.1 per cent of GDP , which was comfortably financed along with sizable accretion to reserves .
In terms of financing , a noteworthy feature of 2015-16 was the highest ever inflows of foreign direct investment , impervious to the bouts of turbulence in the international financial markets .
By the end of the year , the level of reserves was equivalent of 11 months of imports .
Other indicators of external sustainability also recorded improvement .
1.10 In the aftermath of the Brexit referendum , the outlook for the global economy has weakened , as reflected in downgrades of projections by multilateral agencies .
1.11 So far , the effects of Brexit on the Indian economy have been relatively muted , including the immediate impact on equity and foreign exchange markets .
Yet , in view of the linkages to the UK and the euro area , spillovers through trade , finance and expectations channels cannot be ruled out as events unfold .
Abstracting from these external shocks , the near-term domestic outlook appears somewhat brighter than the outcome for 2015- 16 .
While a durable pick-up in investment activity remains elusive , consumption will continue to provide the main support to aggregate demand and may receive a boost from the revival of rural demand in response to the above-normal and spatially well-distributed southwest monsoon as well as from the seventh pay commission ' s award .
Notably , the impact of the fifth and sixth pay commissions ' awards on growth was also positive .
Agricultural and allied activities are expected to benefit substantially from the distinct improvement in moisture conditions .
1.12 - Industrial activity has been in contraction mode in the early months of 2016-17 , pulled down by manufacturing .
Export demand also remains anaemic .
Successive downgrades of global growth projections by multilateral agencies and the continuing sluggishness in world trade points to further slackening of external demand going forward .
Some support to industrial activity may , however , stem from the recent measures taken by the Government such as 100 per cent FDI in defence , civil aviation , pharmaceuticals and broadcasting .
1.13 Service sector activity is likely to receive a stimulus especially under the category of public administration , defence and other services as public expenditure on wages , salaries and pensions translates into disposable incomes .
Overall GVA growth is , therefore , projected at 7.6 per cent in 2016-17 , up from 7.2 per cent last year .
A better than anticipated agricultural performance and the possibility of allowances under the seventh pay commission ' s award being paid out in Q4 of 2016-17 provide upsides to this projection .
On the other hand , a rise in the implicit GVA deflator as WPI inflation hardens will operate as a statistical downside .
1.14 Headline CPI inflation has ranged above target in the first quarter of 2016-17 , driven up by the seasonal surge in prices of fruits and vegetables and protein-rich items on top of still elevated prices of pulses and sugar .
With the steady progress of the southwest monsoon , however , these prices are likely to moderate over the ensuing months .
A heartening development is the recent softening of inflation excluding food and fuel , which could sustain if international crude prices remain soft and , in turn , hold down prices of petrol and diesel embedded in transport and communication services .
Further , pulses production may likely increase with a softening impact on food inflation .
Thus , headline inflation is expected to trend towards the target of 5 per cent by the last quarter of the year , although at the current juncture , upside risks are prominent .
Itis also important to take note of the impact of the implementation of the seventh pay commission ' s award on the future trajectory of headline inflation .
The largest effects are expected to emanate from increased house rent allowance in the CPI , which may raise headline inflation in a purely statistical manner .
In addition , indirect effects through demand and expectations channels could add to the headline CPI ' s path .
In aggregate , the impact of the pay commission is expected to peak by September 2017 .
A conducive environment has also been created through appropriate incentives / penalties for states to renew their fiscal consolidation .
The passage of the Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) Bill marks a new era in co-operative fiscal federalism and a growing political consensus for economic reforms .
The implementation of the GST would boost trade , investment and growth by reducing supply chain rigidities , encouraging scale economies , cutting down transportation and transaction costs , as also promoting efficiency gains .
By eliminating the cascading impact of taxes on production and distribution costs , the GST would also improve the overall competitiveness of the economy .
The impact of GST on CPI inflation would largely depend on the standard rate that would be decided by the GST council ; however , the impact is likely to be low , with around 54 per cent of the CPI basket exempt from the GST .
As regards public finances , the GST is expected to widen the tax base , result in better tax compliance and reduce the cost of tax collection .
1.16 As regards implementation of the recommendations of the pay commission , it is noteworthy that nearly 90 per cent of the estimated payout on account of pay , pension and arrears in 2016-17 has already been provided for in the Union Budget .
However , states tend to mimic central pay and pension implementation .
To the extent that states have provided for these outgoes , no deviations from the budgeted targets are envisaged at this juncture .
For states that have not made such provisions in their respective 2016-17 budgets , the implementation of the pay commission ' s recommendations may impose a deviation from fiscal targets in the absence of off- setting fiscal measures , entailing a risk to general government finances , with spillovers to aggregate demand .
1.17 ' India ' s external position is viable and well-buffered to sustain a pick-up in non-oil non- gold imports as growth gathers momentum .
Nevertheless , the external environment continues to pose challenges stemming from large currency movements , a rising incidence of protectionist measures , swift and massive movements of capital and the amplification of uncertainty by the Brexit vote .
Furthermore , the sustenance of terms of trade gains would be predicated upon movements in international commodity prices .
Even as the outlook for capital inflows is optimistic with the recent liberalisation of FDI policy , the repayment of FCNR ( B ) deposits under the special swap scheme due in September to November 2016 will need to be managed carefully .
1.18 Turning to the agenda of structural reforms to reap efficiency and productivity gains , several important steps that are underway need to be persevered with and taken to their logical conclusion .
The UDAY scheme has _ provided a one-time opportunity to DISCOMs to regain financial viability .
In this regard , the MoUs signed by the state governments with the Government of India need to be monitored closely and clauses with regard to user charges and administrative reforms need to be enforced .
Another important area of ongoing reforms is the banking sector for which stressed assets need to be unlocked and put back to work .
The enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code will make it easier for sick companies to either wind up or turn around , and for investors to exit .
The Parliament has also passed amendments to strengthen the Debt Recovery Tribunals for speedier resolution of stressed assets .
In all these issues , harnessing asset management expertise of foreign investors could offer synergies with their business models .
The financial landscape is poised to undergo a significant transformation with the setting up of new institutions and enabling niche strategies .
On-tap licensing of banks will facilitate expanding the universal banking network .
Furthermore , the arrival of peer-to-peer lending and other Fin Tech-leveraged financial entities is expected to expand the reach of finance through innovative technological platforms .
1.19 Finally , the need for intensifying structural reforms in factor markets , particularly land and labour , is now widely seen as necessary for realising the potential of the economy and for avoiding jobless growth .
In this context , various levels of government need to act together for the best results .
First , labour regulations are often cited to be a significant barrier to growth , particularly with regard to large and medium scale manufacturing firms .
Initiatives taken by some state governments to amend labour laws are a good starting point .
Second , land acquisition processes are another critical factor affecting the pace of investment .
State governments may consider putting in place a transparent and viable framework , de-bottlenecking land _ constraints , e.g. , as in Andhra Pradesh , to drive the capex cycle .
The National Agriculture Market ( NAM ) - a pan- India electronic trading platform - is an important example towards setting up a common agriculture market .
Stimulating private investment and reinvigorating the banking sector while maintaining macroeconomic stability remain the key challenges in the year ahead .
Il.1.1 Provisional estimates of the Central Statistics Office ( CSO ) indicate that a moderate recovery characterised macroeconomic conditions in 2015-16 , with a slight pick-up in pace in the second half of the year despite the drag from slowing investment .
Private final consumption remained the bedrock of domestic demand , expanding to contribute over half of the overall GDP growth .
Ongoing fiscal consolidation restrained government consumption during 2015- 16 .
This was in part due to the pace of contraction of imports outpacing that of exports , and in part due to gains in net terms of trade .
1.1.2 As regards aggregate supply , agricultural and allied activities were buffeted by headwinds from deficiencies in precipitation and coverage in both monsoon seasons during the year , as well as floods and cyclones in the southern region in Q3 and unseasonal rains and hail in the western region in Q4 .
Value added in industry gathered momentum , especially in the second half of 2015-16 , with the large boost provided by the decline in input costs offsetting the stalling evolution of industrial output and more recently , on sales growth .
Overall , domestic economic activity was shored up by macroeconomic stability as reflected in falling inflation and narrowing current account and fiscal deficits .
The stable pace of expansion of the economy , though moderate by pre-crisis standards , stood out in a weakening global economy facing an accentuation of downside risks and heightened financial volatility .
The pace of expansion in real GDP at market prices gained further momentum in 2015- 16 ( Chart Il.1a ) .
Among the constituents of aggregate demand , private final consumption expenditure ( PFCE ) benefited from higher real incomes enabled by the steady disinflation and rebounded in 2015-16 from the deceleration that set in a year ago .
The improvement was powered by urban consumption as reflected in the coincident surge in sales of passenger vehicles .
By contrast , rural consumption was subdued , with two consecutive years of deficient monsoons having taken a toll on rural incomes .
Note : Component-wise contributions do not add up to real GDP growth as change in stocks , valuables and discrepancies are not included .
growth moderated as falling inflation allowed for nominal wages growth to ease and market wage rates converged to minimum wage levels induced by the MGNREGA effect .
1.1.4 Gross fixed capital formation ( GFCF ) remained subdued during 2015-16 .
At the same time , business sentiment improved in response to several initiatives such as ' Make in India ' and faster clearances of stalled projects , particularly , in respect of non-environmental permissions ( Chart 11.2 ) .
The Project Monitoring Group cleared 168 - Cost of private projects ( right scale ) - Cost of government projects ( right scale ) Source : Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy ( CMIE ) .
Accordingly , the slackening of the overall rate of investment in 2014-15 - for the third year in succession - could have bottomed out in 2015-16 .
The continuing improvement in saving by private non-financial corporations and a steady reduction in dis-saving by the general government sector are likely to partially offset the decline in households ' physical saving and the pressure on the resources of public sector financial and non- financial corporations .
Preliminary estimates showed that the household net financial saving rate increased to 7.7 per cent of gross national disposable income ( GNDI ) in 2015-16 from 7.5 per cent in 2014-15 and 7.4 per cent in 2013-14 .
The improvement reflected a higher rate of increase in gross financial assets in relation to that in financial liabilities .
The increase in gross financial assets was driven primarily by a turnaround in small savings and increases in investment in equities and mutual funds , tax-free bonds by public sector units and currency holdings Table Il.1 : Financial Saving of the Household Sector Item 2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 * 2014-15 * 2015-16 * * : As per the latest estimates of the Reserve Bank ; GNDI : Gross national disposable income .
Financial liabilities also surged reflecting higher borrowings from banks and housing finance companies by the households during the year .
1.1.5 Real gross value added ( GVA ) growth at basic prices recorded a marginal pick-up in 2015- 16 , held back by the slowing rate of growth in the services sector even as _ industrial activity accelerated and agriculture and allied activities recovered from the contraction a year ago .
1.1.6 GVA from agriculture and allied activities posted a modest growth in 2015-16 , in spite of a second consecutive sub-normal monsoon year .
The southwest monsoon fell short of normal precipitation levels by 14 per cent on top of the deficiency of 12 per cent in the preceding year ' s season , with 17 sub-divisions out of 36 receiving deficient rainfall .
The northeast monsoon was also below the long period average ( LPA ) by 23 per cent with a highly skewed distribution .
Reservoir levels were depleted to decadal lows .
Notwithstanding these setbacks , the fourth advance estimates of the Ministry of Agriculture have placed foodgrains production for the year at 0.1 per cent higher than in the previous year , mainly due to increase in wheat production .
All other major foodgrains as well as commercial crops fell below 2014-15 levels .
Source : Food Corporation of India and Ministry of Consumer Affairs , Food and Public Distribution .
1.1.7 In the industrial sector , value added and its contribution to overall GVA growth surged during 2015-16 ( Chart II.1b ) .
In terms of volumes , there was a slowdown from the subdued turnaround in industrial production in the preceding year ( Table II.2 ) .
While mining accelerated to its highest growth in the past five years , a sharp deceleration in basic metals and contraction in food processing suppressed manufacturing output .
The continuing contraction in hydel power constrained a fuller overall expansion in electricity generation .
The lacklustre performance of manufacturing continued through the first quarter of 2016-17 , dragging overall index of industrial production ( IIP ) growth lower than that in the corresponding period of the previous year , even as mining and electricity witnessed improvement .
1.1.8 In terms of use-based activity , capital goods output contracted during 2015-16 , extending a protracted lacklustre performance that set in from 2011-12 except 2014-15 .
The production of insulated rubber cables turned out to be the main drag in this constituent .
Excluding lumpy and order-based insulated rubber cables , which have a miniscule weight in the IIP but suffered an average monthly decline of 85.6 per Table II.2 : Index of Industrial Production Industry Group Weight in IIP Growth Rate 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 April-June Capital goods 8.8 -6.0 -3.6 6.4 -2.9 2.0 -18.0 Source : CSO .
Nonetheless , the depressed production of capital goods , especially machinery , reflects subdued investment demand in the economy .
The drag of insulated rubber cables continued beyond 2015-16 into April-June 2016 and is expected to persist for some more time .
Excluding insulated rubber cables , IIP growth during April-June 2016 would have been 3.6 per cent , instead of growth of 0.6 per cent .
Consumer goods output in 2015-16 came out of contraction in the preceding two years , driven up by durables ( mainly gems and jewellery ) which offset the decline in consumer non-durables ( mainly food products and beverages ) .
The turnaround of consumer goods production was , however , tentative and primarily powered by favourable base effect .
Trends in consumer goods production - both for durables and non-durables in April-June 2016 remained broadly unchanged .
Lead / coincident indicators were mostly softer than a year ago .
Steel consumption and cement production improved in Q4 .
As regards transportation activity , freight / cargo handled by railways , ports and domestic aviation decelerated .
On the other hand , domestic air passenger traffic and sales of commercial and passenger vehicles rose strongly and mitigated the downturn in the sub-sector .
Communication activity was impacted by slowing net additions to cell phone connections due to the introduction of inter-state number portability .
Trade , hotels and restaurants were affected by a deceleration in foreign tourist arrivals .
The category of public administration , defence and other services was held down by the ongoing restraint on public expenditure .
The performance of services sector indicators during April-June 2016 , continues to emit mixed signals with auto sales , port cargo , tourist arrivals and cement production accelerating even as railway freight and steel consumption contracted while the aviation sector decelerated .
1.1.10 The favourable impact of the normal monsoon is expected to work in conjunction with the implementation of the seventh pay commission ' s recommendations to provide a boost to consumption demand .
Keeping in view the provision made by the central government for additional expenditure on account of pay and pension in its budget for 2016-17 , its overall impact is estimated at around 30 basis points ( bps ) in the GVA growth projected by the Reserve Bank for 2016-17 .
11.2.1 Inflation , as measured by the consumer price index ( CPI ) , evolved through three phases during 2015-16 .
In the early months of the year , food price pressures stemming from unseasonal rains and subsequently from a delayed and skewed onset of the southwest monsoon were muted by strong favourable base effects .
By July-August , 2015 inflation ebbed to an intra-year low of 3.7 per cent , the lowest since November 2014 .
In the second phase from September , the base effects dissipated and inflation rose unrelentingly month after month to 5.7 per cent in January 2016 , albeit falling below the target of 6 per cent set for that month in the medium-term disinflation glide path ( Chart II.4 ) .
Prices of pulses - in particular , arhar - emerged as the main driver of this upsurge .
In February-March 2016 , / .e. , in the third phase , vegetable prices declined and surprised on the downside .
Favourable tailwinds from corrections in prices of pulses and downward adjustments in fuel prices pulled down headline inflation to 4.8 per cent in March 2016 .
Chart II.4 : Movements in Headline Inflation ™ @ Base effect HB M-o-M change - - Inflation ( RHS ) 11.2.2 For the year as a whole , inflation averaged 4.9 percent , down from 5.8 percentinthe preceding year ( Appendix Table 4 ) .
Sub-group wise , annual average inflation declined across all the major categories , except in the case of fuel and light .
The current phase of disinflation in India is driven by a combination of positive developments on the supply side such as fall in global commodity prices and the proactive role played by the government in managing food prices as also the anti-inflationary monetary policy stance of the Reserve Bank ( Box Il.1 ) .
A statistical decomposition of contribution of different sub- groups within CPI indicates that the major contribution to disinflation emanated from the food group mainly on account of the government ' s astute supply management policies and also from the fall in global food prices ( Chart 1 ) .
Slowdown in rural wage growth , supply management policies and the decline in oil prices were other facilitating factors .
1.2.3 During April-July 2016 , a sharper than anticipated upturn in the prices of vegetables , sugar , protein-rich items , fruits and pass-through of the increase in global crude oil prices to pump prices of petrol and diesel , reversed the tide .
Consequently , inflation recorded a 23-month high at 6.1 per cent in July 2016 .
11.2.4 Cost conditions were relatively benign during 2015-16 , contributing to the disinflationary momentum .
Globally , a sizable slack and weak commodity prices kept inflation subdued , with the UK , Japan , Europe and Thailand overcast with deflation risks .
In some EMEs even as recession set in ( Brazil and Russia ) , currency depreciation and structural bottlenecks kept inflation elevated ( Chart II.5 ) .
11.2.5 Crude oil prices treaded softly throughout the year - barring short-lived upticks on incoming data - and dipped to US $ 28 a barrel in January 2016 , a 12-year low in terms of the Indian basket of crude oil .
These developments depressed input costs in India considerably , especially those relating to raw materials and intermediates .
11.2.6 Falling costs , especially on account of declining international commodity prices , kept wholesale price index ( WPI ) inflation in negative territory for 17 consecutive months up to March 2016 .
Other indicators of inflation as measured by CPI-IW , CPI-AL , CPI-RL and the GVA deflator also eased during 2015-16 .
Minimum support price ( MSP ) increases were much more moderate in 2015-16 than in earlier years .
Growth rates of rural wages and employee compensation in the organised sector were modest and the corporate sector reported slower growth in staff costs .
Although input prices picked up towards the latter part of the year as polled in purchasing managers ' indices ( PMls ) and surveys of business ( including the Reserve Bank ' s Business Expectations Survey ) , the weakness in pricing power prevented a complete translation into output price increases .
The divergence in inflation of 7.6 percentage points during 2015 can be explained as the combined impact from : a ) difference in prices recorded for similar items ( 0.9 percentage points ) ; b ) difference in weights for similaritems ( 0.03 percentage points ) ; c ) difference in inflation for dissimilar items , that is , scope effects ( 4.9 percentage points ) ; and d ) other effects including the differences in the formulae for compilation of these indices ( 1.8 percentage points ) ' .
The large contribution of scope effects to the overall divergence is unique to 2015 - WPI deflation was concentrated in tradables like basic and intermediate commodities whereas CPI inflation with respect to non-tradables like services , including housing , showed unusual persistence .
Chart II.8 : Inflation and Inflation Volatility 11.2.8 Inflation generally edged down across constituent categories and its volatility was also seen ebbing across the major sub-groups ( Chart 11.8 ) .
While the fuel group was an outlier , the downward inflexibility and persistence in inflation excluding food and fuel , over the greater part of the year was another noteworthy development with implications for inflation dynamics going forward .
1.2.9 The category comprising food items constitutes 45.9 per cent of CPI and contributed 50 per cent to overall inflation in 2015-16 .
Within this category , inflation with respect to cereals , fruits and animal-based protein items remained broadly range-bound ; pulses and products were the main contributors to food inflation ( Chart II.9 ) .
Besides the shortfall in production during 2014-15 and the absence of a procurement mechanism until 2015-16 , a number of structural factors such as sensitivity to pests and natural calamities kept inflation with respect to pulses at elevated levels .
Unseasonal rainfall and temporary supply-demand mismatches pushed up vegetable prices , particularly of onions , during June-September 2015 .
In the case of cereals despite a second successive year of sub-normal monsoon , the prices increased only marginally on account of mild increase in MSPs and higher offtake by the states to check price pressures .
1.2.10 The fuel group has a weight of 6.8 per cent in the CPI and it accounted for 7.1 per cent of headline inflation during the year .
Inflation in this category primarily reflects administered price changes in respect of coal , electricity and LPG as well as other household fuels including firewood and chips .
I1.2.11 CPlinflation excluding food and fuel edged up gradually through the year and stood at 4.9 per cent in December 2015 , before giving ground in the last quarter of the year , and edging lower in July 2016 to 4.6 per cent .
These movements were primarily driven by pricepressuresinthe sub-groups of transport and communication , housing , personal care and effects , and health and education ( Chart 11.10 ) .
The cumulative increase of 712 per litre and < 14 per litre , respectively , in petrol and diesel excise duties since November 2014 dampened the pass-through of falling global crude prices into the transport and communication sub- Chart II.10 : CPI Excluding Food and Fuel Drivers - NN .
Pricing decisions generally vary based on company size , past price changes and seasonality as well as firms ' adjustments to shocks .
The study ' s findings show that firms respond more often to a positive price shock by adjusting prices upwards than in the opposite direction .
Similarly , strong demand conditions induce a higher increase in prices , whereas the likelihood of lowering prices during weak demand conditions is lower .
Housing inflation increased gradually since September 2015 .
While inflation in personal care and effects edged up a bit in the second half of 2015-16 , inflation in services such as health and education exhibited persistent price pressures .
There is also evidence of price rigidities in protein-rich food items .

The full impact on CPI inflation , which mainly comes through the direct effects of an increase in house rent allowance when it is effected , will be reflected in a staggered manner over ensuing months .
Indirect effects through the expectations channel could also feed back into inflation outcomes .
State governments are likely to follow up with revisions of salaries and allowances for their employees .
Therefore , most of the inflation impact is likely to spill over into the next financial year . ?
Collected by the Labour Bureau for constructing the CPI for industrial workers for 78 centres spread across the country on a monthly frequency .
The evolution of monetary and credit conditions during 2015-16 was a study in contrast to the preceding year .
Whereas the slow pace of economic growth had restrained monetary and credit aggregates in 2014-15 , agrowing disconnect from underlying economic activity became evident in 2015-16 , especially in the second half of the year .
Notwithstanding the lower accretion to net foreign assets than a year ago , reserve money expanded at a faster pace , propelled by unusually high and persisting demand for currency .
As credit conditions improved with a modest lowering of lending rates , banks rebalanced their loans portfolio in favour of the relatively stress-free personal loans segment .
The resulting pick-up in credit growth enabled some re-intermediation by the banking system in the flow of funds to the commercial sector .
11.3.2 Reserve money ( RM ) increased by 13.1 per cent on a y-o-y basis in 2015-16 , higher than 11.3 per cent a year ago .
The resulting injection of liquidity of € 2.5 trillion during 2015-16 was sizably higher than that in the preceding year .
In 2015-16 , in a recurring phenomenon characterising intra- year patterns of RM , about 54 per cent of the whole year ' s increase in reserve money took place in March , with the period March 25-31 , 2016 accounting for 31 per cent of the annual increase .
Various factors drove this build-up including high demand for liquidity from banks as they strove to government balances surged with the last instalment of advance tax collection .
11.3.3 The expansion in RM in 2015-16 primarily took the form of currency in circulation ( CIC ) which increased by 14.9 per cent .
This acceleration - from 11.3 per cent in the previous year - reflects the interplay of several factors such as jewellers ' strike , festival related demand , elections and the like - that are difficult to disentangle quantitatively with precision - which superimposed themselves on the normal requirements of base money by the economy and vitiated the usual seasonal ebb and flow of currency in the system ( Box II.3 ) .
On the other hand , the growth of bankers ' deposits with the Reserve Bank moderated to 7.8 per cent , reflecting subdued deposit growth and some evening out of excess reserves by banks .
However , the usual stockpiling with the Reserve Bank at the end of March 2016 was observed .
From early April , there has been further moderation in these holdings of excess reserves , reflecting greater confidence of banks in their ability to access liquidity under the refinements effected by the Reserve Bank in its liquidity management framework ( details in Chapter III ) .
11.3.4 On the sources side , compositional shifts marked the profile of RM expansion in 2015-16 .
Net foreign assets ( NFA ) , which had been the main driver of RM in the year before , fluctuated widely between accretions during April-October 2015 and depletion during February and early Currency demand is governed by several behavioural and institutional factors such as banking habits , sophistication in payment and settlement systems , development of the financial sector , besides the level of income and the opportunity cost of holding currency .
The long-run relationship between the demand for currency and its underlying determinants indicates that the income elasticity of currency demand has been more than unity over the period 1989-2011 .
Apart from these fundamental determinants , currency demand is influenced by several frictional factors , e.g. , festivals , jewellers ' strike and elections at the union / state levels .
The increase in CIC early in the year 2016-17 was also noticeable in states that were not going for elections .
Since 2012-13 , 26 general elections for state legislative assembly and one for the Lok Sabha have been conducted so far .
A surge in currency demand by around 11 per cent on a year-on-year basis in May 2014 across India coincided with the general election .
State elections also coincided with large currency demand in those states and / or neighbouring states .
The increase in currency in absolute terms during April-May 2014 , was around 650 billion , € 268 billion higher than that in April-May 2013 .
Currency demand in the run-up to elections accounted for close to a fifth of the overall increase in CIC during January- March 2016 .
CIC is known for its seasonal fluctuations , which picks up in April because of large government expenditure and procurements , and in October / November due to festivals ( Dussehra and Diwali ) .
After controlling for these seasonal factors with appropriate dummies , the coefficients of most of the pre-election dummies were found to be positive and statistically significant .
Finally , the joint statistical significance of election dummies was evaluated using the Wald Test , which lent credence to these findings .
However , post-election month dummies were not found to be statistically significant , though most of them had the expected negative signs .
To sum up , the sharp increase in currency demand during 2015-16 may be attributed to a cluster of state elections , apart from other frictional factors such as festival-related demand and jewellers ' strike , even as the underlying relationship between the demand for currency and its fundamental determinants such as income , inflation and interest rates remained stable .
It was only in the latter part of March , that risk aversion abated and capital flows to India resumed , enabling some rebuilding of NFA .
In the event , the net increase in NFA through purchases of foreign currency from authorised dealers was of the order of $ 631 billion as against ¥ 3,431 billion a year ago , accounting for 25 per cent of the RM expansion .
I1.3.5 Net domestic assets ( NDA ) operations played a stabilising role and also supported the growth of liquidity , constituting around 65 per cent of RM .
Within NDA , net RBI credit to the Government increased by % 605 billion ( Chart Il.11 ) .
Net open market purchases ( outright ) were around % 523 billion - comprising net purchases of 631 billion through auctions and net sale of € 108 billion through NDS-OM - as against a net sale of around % 640 billion a year ago .
However , the liquidity impact of these operations was partially offset by increases in cash balances of the Government with the Reserve Bank .
Net Reserve Bank credit to banks and the commercial sector , reflecting net repo auctions that injected liquidity into the system to tide over transient episodes of liquidity tightness , increased by around & 71 trillion during the year to ¥ 3 trillion as on March 31 , 2016 and fell sharply thereafter .
The Reserve Bank also transferred a surplus of % 658.96 billion during the year to the Government , which expanded liquidity as it translated into public spending .
11.3.6 In 2016-17 so far ( up to August 12 ) , RM grew at 15.0 per cent , far higher than 9.8 per cent in the corresponding period last year , mainly driven by CIC which increased by % 823 billion as compared with % 461 billion last year .
pursuance of the move to a liquidity position closer to neutrality , as against an OMO sale of % 223 billion in the comparable period last year , which has reduced the banks ' dependence on the overnight and term windows of the Reserve Bank .
Net purchase from authorised dealers , a source of autonomous liquidity has remained relatively muted in 2016-17 so far .
1.3.7 A break in the organic relationship between RM and M , became discernible in 2015- 16 , beginning from September 2015 right up to August 2016 .
Driving the unusually high expansion of RM during the year , the acceleration of currency demand to a multi-year high pushed up the currency-deposit ( c / d ) ratio to a level last observed in May 2012 .
Data are provisional .
This is also corroborated by the upturn observed in the c / d ratio for the household sector since 2014-15 .
The other determinant of the money multiplier - the reserve-deposit ( r / d ) ratio - remained broadly stable by contrast , barring the usual end-March spike caused by banks ' overwhelming predilection for balances with the Reserve Bank .
This is the first instance in the recent past when the c / d ratio influenced the money multiplier by itself ; during April 2007-September 2008 , February 2010-April 2010 and January 2012-February 2013 , the behaviour of currency demand had either reinforced or offset the impact of changes in the cash reserve ratio ( CRR ) on the multiplier .
These developments pulled down the growth of M , in 2015-16 , especially in the second half of the year , to 10.1 per cent ( y-o-y ) , lower than 10.9 per cent in the previous year ( Table II.3 ) .
The money multiplier declined to 5.3 in 2015-16 from 5.5 a year ago ( Chart II.12 ) .
The M , growth in 2016-17 so far ( up to August 05 , 2016 ) at 10.7 per cent remained at the same level as in the previous year .
Chart II.12 : Currency-Deposit , Reserve-Deposit Ratio ™ Money multiplier ( right scale ) - Currency-deposit ratio - - Reserve-deposit ratio 1.3.8 In terms of the components of M , , demand deposit growth broadly tracked the movements in credit .
Time deposits were muted by the moderation in deposit rates ( both nominal and real ) , which also reduced the opportunity cost of holding cash .
Large issuances of long term tax free bonds by various public sector units contributed to the deceleration in deposits , besides the higher returns on small savings which are not subject to tax deduction at source ( TDS ) .
As a result , scheduled commercial banks ' ( SCBs ' ) deposits decelerated to 9.3 per cent in 2015-16 , the lowest since 1963-64 .
The wedge between credit and deposits in terms of growth rates imparted a structural character to liquidity developments during the year .
1.3.9 Developments in bank credit during 2015-16 reflected the interplay of several factors .
Non-food credit ( NFC ) growth stalled in the first half of the year , weighed down by subdued off-take and headwinds from asset quality concerns among banks .
On the other hand , net flows to the industrial sector slowed markedly to 2.7 per cent - from 5.6 per cent a year ago - reflecting the stress in the larger constituents such as infrastructure , construction , petroleum and coal .
Stalling of projects in the power and road segments and dwindling cash flows which affected the quality of bank assets deterred new lending to infrastructure .
The credit profile of the construction sector was impacted by the slowdown in real estate and the pressure of unsold house inventories .
Basic metal and metal products , chemicals and chemical products , and textiles , on the other hand , absorbed higher credit flows .
The credit offtake was also impacted by the high incidence of asset quality stress on balance sheets of banks as well as corporate de-leveraging , especially in Q4 .
Personal loans turned out to be the strongest driver of bank credit , rising by 19.4 per cent as against 15.5 per cent a year earlier .
Within this category , housing loans , which account for more than 50 per Table II.4 : Credit Deployment to Select Sectors Sectors Outstanding as on Year-on-year growth ( per cent ) ( Ellin ) 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 Note : Data are provisional and relate to select banks which cover about 95 per cent of total non-food credit extended by all SCBs .
Credit to the services sector also picked up on the back of higher lending to NBFCs , followed by professional services .
1.3.11 Bank group-wise , public sector banks ( PSBs ) recorded credit growth of 6.6 per cent during 2015-16 ( 6.5 per cent in 2014-15 ) vis-a- vis 24.7 per cent ( 17.4 per cent in 2014-15 ) clocked by private sector banks .
Private sector banks , on the other hand , registered robust credit growth in these segments .
In the personal loans segment , both the groups of banks showed higher credit growth during 2015-16 , spurred by the lower incidence of stressed assets .
11.38.12 NFC growth improved to 9.9 per cent during 2016-17 so far ( up to August 05 , 2016 ) from 9.2 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year .
Adjusting for the impact of two new banks and UDAY bonds , NFC growth works out to be 10.4 per cent as on August 05 , 2016 .
Sectoral pattern of credit for June 2016 indicated that personal loans continued to show strong growth , while credit growth to industry remained moderate .
1.3.13 The total flow of resources to the commercial sector was far higher by around 14 per cent in 2015-16 than in the preceding year , mainly on account of a pick-up in flows from the banking sources - higher credit disbursal and investment in non-SLR assets ( Table II.5 ) .
Domestic non-banking fund flows were lower due to the decline in private placements and net issuances of commercial papers ( CPs ) .
Initial public offerings ( IPOs ) picked up in 2015-16 after a lull of around four years .
ADR : American depository receipts ; GDR : Global depository receipts ; FCCB : Foreign currency convertible bond ; LIC : Life Insurance Corporation of India .
Equity and foreign exchange markets were most affected by global spillovers and were rendered vulnerable to sporadic overshooting and heightened volatility in response to fluctuations in global financial asset prices and portfolio flows .
Credit and money markets were relatively sheltered and activity in these segments was driven by domestic factors - asset quality concerns in the former , and the evolution of liquidity in the latter .
11.4.2 Money market activity broadly tracked its usual intra-year pattern in 2015-16 .
Easy conditions ensued in the beginning of the year - as end-2014-15 balance sheet adjustments unwound - and prevailed right up to the first half of October , interrupted by a brief interlude in the second half of April and in May when liquidity dried up due to a passing slowdown in fiscal spending and again in mid-September due to tax outflows .
Money market rates trended below the policy rate with a sustained downside bias , except during mid-April to May .
Notably , besides the resumption of public expenditure from June , a structural mismatch between deposit mobilisation and credit off-take during this period engendered surplus liquidity in the money market .
The volatility of the weighted average call money rate ( WACR ) fell significantly .
Interest rates in the collateralised borrowing and lending obligation ( CBLO ) and market repo segments were tightly aligned with the WACR but with a distinct softening tendency .
Interest rates on commercial papers ( CPs ) , certificates of deposits ( CDs ) and 91-day treasury bills also traded on an easing note and priced in 50 bps reduction in the policy rate announced at end-September .
Turnover in all segments of the overnight market generally picked up in the first half of the year starting from May 2015 .
With deposit growth slipping into single digit along with pick up in NFC , liquidity management was further complicated on account of currency leakage from the banking system on a durable basis ( see Box Il.3 ) .
Other money market rates rose in sync , with spreads relative to the WACR rising to the peak of 28 bps in case of market repo and 29 bps in CBLO in the second half of December 2015 .
11.4.4 Fiscal rectitude was visible in the general rise in cash balances of the Government throughout the last quarter of the year .
Moreover , with the pick-up in NFC during this period , CP and CD rates firmed up and their spread over WACR widened by over 50 bps ( Chart II.14 ) .
Other money market rates also hardened considerably to 7.36 per cent in the CBLO segment and to 7.91 per cent in the market repo segment .
Through the second half of the year , turnover in money market segments increased , mainly reflecting the call money and market repo Chart II.14 : Key Policy and Other Important Rates - - Reverse Repo - - Repo - MSF WACR segments , even as the CBLO segment showed a decline .
11.4.5 During 2016-17 so far ( up to August 11 ) , money market rates have generally exhibited a softening trend on the back of comfortable liquidity situation in the domestic financial system .
The WACR remained anchored to the policy rate with a softening bias on account of 25 bps reduction in the policy repo rate in April 2016 , narrowing of interest rate corridor to 100 bps , reduction in the minimum daily maintenance of CRR to 90 per cent of the requirement and significant easing of liquidity conditions .
Other money market rates , viz . , CBLO , market repo , CD and CP rates also softened in sync .
11.4.6 In the government securities ( g-secs ) market , yields hardened in the beginning of 2015 -16 on prevailing bearish sentiments in the market and also tracking a weak rupee .
By mid-May , the drying up of liquidity and emergence of stress in the German bund market triggered sell-offs and hardening of yields globally , including in India .
Expectations of another sub-normal monsoon also kept yields elevated through June 2015 ( Chart 11.15 ) .
After trading tightly range-bound , yields started to ease from the last week of August as expectations of monetary policy accommodation domestically gained ground , aided by the US Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) keeping Chart II.15 : G-Sec Yield Curve - Mar 31,15 - Jun30,15 - - Sep 30 , 15 - Dec 31,15 - Mar31,16 - - Aug 12 , 16 the policy rate on hold in its September meeting .
Over the first half of the year , yield moved in a range of 7.53 per cent to 8.09 per cent .
Average daily turnover picked up in the secondary g-secs market , up by over 7 per cent from a year ago .
From the second week of October , yields firmed up in response to a glut of primary issuances .
Expectations of an interest rate hike by the US Fed in December , some increase in _ inflation and the continuing oversupply of securities due to borrowings by states , concerns on issuance of UDAY bonds , and borrowing by public sector entities through tax-free bonds , also contributed to the firming up of yields .
The announcement of the Union Budget 2016-17 including adherence to the fiscal consolidation brought some relief , with the yields easing on a positive sentiment , supported by low inflation during February-March 2016 as well as favourable global developments , particularly the Fed ' s dovish guidance .
Since mid-June 2016 , markets have rallied and yields softened on the back of the Brexit referendum , easy liquidity conditions supported by a series of OMO purchases ( outright ) , lower inflation concerns due to normal monsoon so far and expectations of rate cut .
The Brexit vote has led to market expectations of easy accommodative stance and low rates by central banks the world over .
Further , status quo on interest rate maintained by the US Fed also supported the g-sec yield .
As a result , demand for safe haven assets increased and bonds of select EMEs including India rallied on expectations of increased FPI inflows into high yielding bonds .
11.4.8 In 2015-16 , there was a surge in public issuances of corporate bonds .
In the secondary market , however , activity was subdued reflecting low liquidity .
Yield spreads over g-secs increased during the year on concerns relating to balance sheet stress and debt servicing capabilities of less than AAA rated corporate issuers ( Chart I ] .16 ) .
The corporate bond yields also declined following easing of g-secs yields during 2016-17 so far ( up to August 16 ) .
Taking advantage of low yields vis- a-vis bank lending rates , corporates raised more resources from the bond market in the recent period .
1.4.9 The equity market came off the highs scored in 2014-15 and began 2015-16 on a more subdued tone as the slowdown in China followed by the plunge in its equity markets spread bearish sentiment globally .
Domestic factors such as mixed corporate performance , deficient monsoon , concerns about the minimum alternate tax ( MAT ) , asset quality in the banking system , sluggish investment activity and depreciation of rupee engendered by portfolio outflows weighed on the market .
The indications of additional monetary accommodation by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan and of the Fed staying on hold instilled risk-on investor appetite and portfolio flows returned to Indian markets .
By the end of October , the tide turned as greater certainty seemed to form around rate action by the Fed in its December meeting .
Moreover , weak corporate performance and disappointing domestic cues in the form of inflation rising alongside a loss of momentum in industrial activity kept equity markets weak up to the end of December .
The new year ( 2016 ) was marked by extreme turbulence in global markets as fears of a China slowdown resurfaced , fanned by the plunge in crude oil prices to a 12-year low .
There was an outflow of portfolio investment funds from the emerging economies and India was not immune to this , with associated weakening of the rupee .
As public sector banks in India started posting large erosion in profits / losses , a bank led downturn in the equity market took the Sensex down by 17.9 per cent ( over end-March 2015 ) 2014 .
The presentation of the Union Budget at the end of February marked a clear turning point .
Optimism returned as portfolio flows resumed and the improvement in sentiment provided upside to the rupee .
The rally in Asian markets , more generally , aided the rise of the Sensex in March 2016 ( Chart Il.17 ) .
Over 2015-16 , the Sensex declined by 9.4 per cent .
1.4.11 In 2016-17 so far ( upto August 18 ) , the Sensex has gained by nearly 11 percent over end- March 2016 on the back of investor optimism over good progress of monsoon , initiation of reform measures by the government , implementation of the seventh CPC ' s recommendations , sustained FPI buying and passage of the GST Bill by the Parliament .
Even though the Indian stock market was temporarily affected by Brexit in tandem with sell-off in the global equity markets , it rebounded strongly and pared all its losses in the subsequent sessions .
1.4.12 The primary segment of the equity market was disconnected from the high turbulence affecting the secondary segment .
During 2015- 16 , primary resource mobilisation in the form of IPOs surged to its highest level since 2011-12 , with 73 IPOs raising resources of the order of 143 billion which was four times the mobilisation in the previous year .
Resources raised through non-convertible debentures increased by 262 per cent on a year-on-year basis , garnering resources of % 341 billion .
Public sector units ( PSUs ) raised % 435 billion through both public issuance and private placement of tax free bonds during 2015-16 .
Resource mobilisation through IPOs continued to be buoyant and aggregated around % 75 billion during April-July 2016 as compared with $ 29 billion during the corresponding period of the previous year .
1.4.18 A combination of global and domestic developments impacted the foreign exchange market in the early months of 2015-16 .
The exchange rate of the rupee traded with a downside bias , and was vulnerable to spillovers from the Greek crisis , global sell-offs , hawkish FOMC guidance and the uncertainty surrounding the evolution of international crude prices .
Domestic developments amplified these pressures - the persistent shrinking of exports ; portfolio outflows in response to MAT ; and projections of a sub- normal monsoon .
After a brief lull of range-bound movements , the exchange rate came under renewed downward pressure in mid-August with sudden devaluation of the renminbi and the sell- offs in Chinese equity markets .
The rupee crossed the level of 66 against the US dollar at the end of August before stabilising and trading tightly range-bound through September .
Through this eventful period for emerging market currencies , the rupee turned out to be better performing among the peer currencies .
I1.4.14 Inthe second half of October , depreciating pressures set in again with growing anticipation of policy rate action by the Fed in December .
The exit of portfolio investors from Indian debt and equity markets accentuated the pressures on the rupee .
1.4.15 While the turmoil in international financial markets kept the rupee under pressure through January and the first half of February 2016 , conditions stabilised thereafter .
The presentation of the Union Budget 2016-17 , followed by resumption of portfolio flows on dovish Fed guidance , helped stabilise the rupee and imparted a modest appreciation bias by the close of the year .
The depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar during 2015-16 was moderate relative to other EMEs ( Table II.6 ) .
In nominal terms , it depreciated by 6.6 per cent against the US dollar during the year , while in real effective terms it appreciated by 2.9 per cent against a basket of 36 currencies .
Forward premia generally showed a declining trend during 2015-16 reflecting , inter alia , the declining interest rate differential between India and the US .
While the interbank segment maintained the previous year ' s level in terms of activity , there was a slight dip in merchant turnover .
Overall , the spot segment saw an uptick in volumes while forward / swap activity dropped during 2015-16 .
During 2016-17 so far ( up to August 16 ) , the rupee broadly remained range bound with a mild depreciating bias under transient pressure due to Brexit .

This had positive implications for the quality of central government finances since budgeted capital spending was largely preserved .
Further , revenue expenditure declined as a proportion to GDP .
The government has reaffirmed its determination to stay the course on consolidation through 2016-17 and bring down the gross fiscal deficit ( GFD ) to 3.0 per cent of GDP by 2017-18 .
At the sub-national level , state governments budgeted for a retrenchment in capital outlay in 2015-16 in order to renew their fiscal rectitude after the expansion in capital outlay pushed up GFD in 2014-15 .
While the return to the path of consolidation is welcome , the potential erosion in the quality of expenditure - the theme of the Reserve Bank ' s report on State Finances in 2015-16 - raises concerns .
Central Government Finances in 2015-16 11.5.2 The fiscal strategy for 2015-16 was mainly revenue-driven .
Additional revenue mobilisation ( ARM ) accounted for around 15 per cent of indirect tax revenue , imparting significantly higher growth to collections ( Chart 11.18 ) .
Revenue from union excise duty was 23.6 per cent higher than budgeted , reflecting upward duty revisions on petroleum products for consumption-smoothing in the face of a sharp decline in international crude prices .
Revenues from service tax rose 25 per cent on account of the revision in the service tax rate from 12.36 per cent to 14.0 per cent during the year and the imposition of the Swachh Bharat cess ; also , the negative list ( introduced in 2012-13 ) was pruned , resulting in some increase in the tax base .
In contrast , direct tax collections recorded a shortfall of 5.8 per cent relative to budget estimates ( BE ) .
Collection of direct and indirect tax revenues in 2015-16 ( provisional accounts ) was % 14.57 trillion as against the revised estimate ( RE ) of % 14.60 trillion .
The total collection thus represents a growth of 17.0 per cent over the previous year .
Non-tax revenues exceeded budgetary targets by 16.6 per cent due to higher dividends and profits .
Accordingly , notwithstanding the shortfall of 63.6 per cent in the disinvestment target , non- debt receipts turned out to be marginally higher than budgeted .
11.5.3 Capital outlay was higher than in 2014- 15 , mainly on irrigation , defence and roads and bridges .
Apart from the revenue efforts , it was non-plan capital expenditure that bore the brunt of fiscal adjustment .
Revenue expenditure grew at a modest rate of 5.5 per cent .
11.5.4 Reflecting these developments , the budgeted targets for the GFD-GDP ratio of 3.9 per cent and for the primary deficit ( PD ) of 0.7 per cent were met as borne out in the revised estimates and provisional accounts .
In spite of the shortfall in direct tax revenues , the revenue deficit ( RD ) at 2.5 per cent was significantly lower than budgeted ( 2.8 per cent ) ( Table II.7 ) .
Central Government Finances in 2016-17 11.5.5 Set against the backdrop of the fiscal performance in 2015-16 , revenue mobilisation through taxes is likely to lose some buoyancy in 2016-17 - buoyancy of gross tax revenue is budgeted to decline from 2.0 to 1.1 .
While the growth of gross tax revenue is projected to decelerate over the year , non-tax revenues and disinvestment proceeds have been budgeted to grow sharply during 2016-17 .
Net receipts from communication services - spectrum auctions , spectrum renewals and licence fees - - are budgeted at ¥ 990 billion while disinvestment proceeds are projected to grow by 123.2 per cent .
11.5.6 The central government ' s total expenditure is budgeted to pick up in 2016-17 in order to accommodate , inter alia , additional revenue expenditure relating to the implementation of the seventh pay commission and One-Rank-One- Pension ( OROP ) awards .
However , amidst this expansion , capital expenditure - both including and excluding defence - is projected to grow at a considerably slower pace and , in fact , decline as a proportion to GDP .
Notwithstanding the deceleration , an allocation of € 250 billion has been made for recapitalisation of public sector banks ( PSBs ) under the Indradhanush plan announced in August 2015 .
Of this amount , the government has already provided % 229 billion to 13 PSBs in the current fiscal .
Reflecting these projections , GFD is estimated to fall to 3.5 per cent of GDP in 2016-17 alongside a decline in other key deficit indicators .
1.5.7 As per the latest information available , the fiscal position of the central government deteriorated during April-June 2016-17 as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year .
RD and GFD , both at their current levels and as per cent of BE , were higher than those in the corresponding period of the previous year .
During this period , a substantial increase in tax revenue was offset by the increase in revenue expenditure , particularly plan revenue expenditure .
Revenue mobilisation was robust on account of growth in both direct and indirect taxes .
Revenue expenditure grew by 24.3 per cent as compared to a growth of 2.4 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year .
Capital expenditure registered a significant decline , both under plan and non-plan heads .
1.5.8 As per the seventh pay commission ' s recommendations , the total burden for the central government on account of pay , pensions and arrears will amount to % 606.08 billion in 2016- 17 .
The central government has provisioned for 538.44 billion in Union Budget for this , which suggests a shortfall of % 67.64 billion ( 0.04 per cent of GDP ) * for 2016-17 .
The government will get direct tax revenue from the beneficiaries of higher salaries and pensions as well as indirect taxes on goods and services purchased , which , to a large extent , would have been factored in the budget estimates .
As against the budgeted GFD-GDP ratio of 2.4 per cent for 2015-16 , states ' GFD-GDP ratio increased to 3.3 per cent in 2015-16 ( RE ) due to deterioration in revenue account , while capital outlay remained stable .
The revenue account deteriorated mainly due to decline in both tax and non-tax revenues .
1.5.10 The GFD-GDP ratio for state governments for 2016-17 is budgeted at 2.8 per cent while the revenue account is expected to turnaround from a deficit to a surplus mode , indicating the states ' intentions to revert to the process of fiscal consolidation ( Chart II.19 ) .
Improvements in the fiscal position are based on budgeted higher tax revenues and lower development expenditure ( Box II.4 ) .
Chart II.19 : Key Deficit Indicators of State Governments 1 " 2010-13 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 l @ Revenue deficit Mi Gross fiscal deficit MM Primary deficit Note : Data for 2014-15 to 2016-17 are based on budget documents for 2016-17 pertaining to 26 states out of which 3 are Vote on Account .
4 GDP for 2016-17 has been projected at ¥ 150,650.10 billion in the Union Budget 2016-17 .
5 Data for 2015-16 and 2016-17 are based on budget documents for 2016-17 pertaining to 26 states out of which three are Vote on Account .
These 26 states usually account for around 95 per cent of the total expenditure .
Regional Imbalance in Socio-economic Development The impact of growth on socio-economic development has not been uniform across all Indian States .
If the indicators of economic growth , installed power capacity and the credit to deposit ( C-D ) ratio are factored in , only a few states have emerged as leading in terms of both growth and economic development ( Table 1 ) .
Goa ( 5.1 per cent ) , Kerala ( 7.1 per cent ) , Himachal Pradesh ( 8.1 per cent ) , Sikkim ( 8.2 per cent ) and Punjab ( 8.3 per cent ) registered the lowest poverty rates and performed much better than the all-lndia average of 21.9 per cent during 2011-12 .
State-wise data on human development indicators also display considerable variations .
Jammu and Kashmir , Assam and Manipur are usually unable to attract sizable private investments due to poor infrastructure which would be difficult to upgrade due to lack of resources .
The challenge , in essence , is to break this vicious circle .

General Government Finances in 2015-16 I1.5.11 In view of the deterioration in state finances during 2015-16 , the general government gross fiscal deficit increased to 7.2 per cent of GDP from 6.5 per cent in 2014-15 .
The combined finances of the central and state governments , however , reflect the resolve towards consolidation , with the general government GFD budgeted at 6.3 per cent of GDP for 2016-17 .
1.6.1 India faced a _ testing international environment in 2015-16 , as did other EMEs , with still weakening global trade and growth rendering external demand anaemic .
The pass-through of soft international commodity prices to import prices was quick albeit uneven while the dent in commodity export prices was more moderate .
Consequently , the terms of trade gains that accrued were larger than in the preceding year .
Even as the drag from external demand pulled down exports , imports continued to shrink at a faster pace and the trade deficit narrowed to its lowest level since 2010-11 .
Bouts of volatility because of high turbulence in global financial markets produced misalignments and overshoots in major exchange rates and asset prices .
As a result , the Indian economy was exposed to sudden shifts in sentiment on global cues and considerable flux in net capital flows , particularly portfolio flows , which impacted the _ financial account of India ' s balance of payments ( BoP ) ® .
Notwithstanding these challenging developments , astute management including a _ progressively liberal FDI policy ensured a steady improvement in external sector sustainability , with the level of reserves being built up by US $ 17.9 billion on a BoP basis in 2015-16 .
1.6.2 The slump in commodity prices , weak global demand and a surge in _ protectionist measures across advanced and emerging economies pulled exports into contraction for the second consecutive year in 2015-16 Chart II.20 : Destination-wise Demand Conditions and Source : DGCI & S and IMF ( WEO ) .
Further , the decline was pervasive across constituents , with several items shrinking in terms of both volume and value ( Chart II.21 ) .
Lower oil prices brought refined petroleum exports to about half their level a year ago .
Non-oil exports declined by 8.5 per cent , with exports of key products including engineering goods , electronics , leather and gems and jewellery contracting in terms of either volume or value or both .
Sector-specific constraints were also manifest : for engineering goods , demand weakened in key markets ; for gems and jewellery , declining gold prices interacted with weak demand ; and for cotton exports , it was the sharp slowdown in demand from China .
Various measures were undertaken during the year to boost exports , including expanded coverage of the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme , raising of duty drawback rates for select sectors and re-introduction of the interest stabilisation scheme .
Amid global trade uncertainties , however , exports are yet to show a firm recovery which declined in July 2016 after expanding for the first time in 19 months in June .
Non-oil non-gold imports recorded a broad-based decline , barring a few items such as machinery , pulses , fertilisers and electronic goods which rose sharply to either bridge the widening domestic supply gaps or in response to a turnaround in sector-specific investments ( Chart II.23 ) .
However , urea imports fell in response to a record domestic production , but other types of fertiliser imports rose in both value and volume terms .
The strong revival of domestic coal production reduced imports sizably .
Notwithstanding the mild recovery in global crude oil prices and rise in volume of POL imports , the double-digit decline in merchandise imports continued during April-July 2016 .
The difficult international trade environment impacted these invisible transactions diversely in 2015-16 .
Among services , exports of merchandise trade related transportation services were significantly impacted by the deceleration in global trade and cargo movements .
On the other hand , the launching of e-tourist visas in November 2014 and depreciation of the rupee during the year seem to have benefited inbound tourist arrivals and exports of travel services .
India ' s software exports remained broadly resilient in the face of slow global growth , benefiting from higher demand in banking , financial services and insurance , retail distribution and manufacturing in major destinations such as the US and continental Europe .
Among other items of invisibles , remittances inflows weakened in 2015-16 reflecting sluggish activity , particularly in the Gulf region which accounts for more than half of the total remittances received in India ( Box II.5 ) .
With a rise in both income receipts and Factors Influencing Remittances to India In India , remittances have financed about 21 per cent of the trade deficit over the last five years .
Even though remittances are a relatively durable source of receipts , a number of studies suggest that they are prone to various push and pull factors .
Since the Gulf region is a major host of migrants from India , the downtrend in international crude oil prices since the second half of 2014-15 has apparently impacted the momentum in inbound remittance flows .
Furthermore , subdued income conditions in other advanced economies in the post-crisis period may also have accentuated the slowdown in remittances inflows to India ( Chart 1 ) .
A vector error correction model ( VECM ) , using annual data from 1982 to 2015 , shows that the long-run elasticity Chart 1 : Sources of Remittances to India ( Share ) Source : World Bank .
* Significant at 1 or 5 per cent level .
The impact of oil prices on remittances is relatively subdued if not accompanied by a corresponding decline in public expenditure .
As expected , a depreciation of the rupee leads to higher remittance flows to India .
Notwithstanding the sharp decline in oil prices in 2015 , the fall in remittances to India has remained modest , offset by other factors such as rupee depreciation , a modest rise in overall public expenditure in gulf countries , growth in per capita income in advanced economies and a favourable interest rate differential .
1.6.5 Notwithstanding the decline in net invisibles , the sharp fall in the merchandise trade deficit enabled a narrowing of the current account deficit ( CAD ) from 1.3 per cent of GDP in 2014- 15 to 1.1 per cent in 2015-16 , the lowest since 2007-08 .
It is noteworthy that since 2013-14 , CAD has remained well within the limits of external sustainability , aided by fall in gold imports and favourable terms of trade ( Chart II.24 ) .
1.6.6 Buoyed by measures to enhance FDI - including raising the ceiling for investments in several important sectors such as broadcasting and defence , as well as rationalising and simplifying procedures and the Make in India initiative - net inflows of FDI surged to US $ 36 billion in 2015- 16 , the highest annual net inflow thus far and about 15 per cent higher than in the previous year .
Even gross FDI flows to India were at a record high of US $ 55.6 billion during the year .
Defying the dominance of mergers and acquisitions in Chart 2 : Oil Prices , Public Expenditure in Major 0 Gulf Countries and Remittances to India Source : IMF , Bloomberg and RBI .
global FDI inflows , green-field investments largely dominated FDI flows to India tripling over the level in 2014 and replacing China as the top destination for green-field FDI ( Charts 11.25 & II.26 ) .
Inflows in the form of deposits by non-resident Indians also remained strong , growing to nearly US $ 16 billion during the year .
Net portfolio flows turned negative during the year with estimated net outflows of US $ 3.5 billion from the equity market and US $ 0.5 billion from debt , in line with the experience of Chart II.25 : Share of EMEs and India in Global FDI Inflows ( Period Average ) Source : UNCTAD .
The sell-off across EMEs reflected concerns about interest rates rising in the US and diverging monetary policy stances in other advanced economies , the slowdown in key emerging markets and heightened geo-political tensions .
Other debt-creating flows such as ECBs and trade credits also were negative under Chart II.26 : Foreign Direct Investment in India - Net FDI as % of GDP ( right scale ) Source : RBI .

11.6.7 External vulnerability indicators improved in 2015-16 as lower CAD and relatively ample net capital inflows enabled a build-up of foreign exchange reserves as buffers against external shocks .
By the end of 2015-16 , India ' s foreign exchange reserves reached a record level of US $ 360.2 billion and improved most of the reserve- based indicators of external vulnerability ( Table 11.8 ) .
Furthermore , FCNR ( B ) deposits and swaps undertaken under the Special Scheme in 2013 and maturing between September and November 2016 are adequately covered by the Reserve Bank ' s forward purchases and are unlikely to pose any serious downward risk to foreign exchange reserves .
drawing on improvements in competitiveness and productivity rather than a boost from world demand ; and ( iv ) the pace of domestic structural reforms to instil confidence among international investors in India as a preferred investment destination .
The target for CPI inflation below 6 per cent by January 2016 was met and the focus has shifted to attaining the inflation target of 5 per cent by the end of 2016-17 .
Effective liquidity management kept the weighted average call rate ( WACR ) tightly around the policy repo rate during 2015-16 .
In April 2016 , the liquidity management framework was revised to progressively move to a position closer to neutrality .
The policy rate corridor around the repo rate was narrowed to + / - 50 bps .
Accordingly , the policy rate was kept unchanged while awaiting transmission of past rate reductions into banks ' lending rates , policy efforts to improve food supply management and the unravelling of global developments including the normalisation of the US monetary policy .
In June 2015 , even as concerns about a sub-normal south west monsoon and its implications for food inflation remained , the Reserve Bank reduced the policy repo rate by Monetary Policy Framework Agreement ( MPFA ) With the signing of the MPFA between the Government of inflation targeting ( FIT ) has been formally adopted in India .
Under the MPFA , the objective of monetary policy is to primarily maintain price stability while keeping in view the objective of growth .
The Reserve Bank was to bring CPI inflation below 6 per cent by January 2016 .
The target for 2016-17 and all subsequent years was set at 4 per cent with a band of + / - 2 per cent .
The MPFA also requires the Reserve Bank to establish an operating target and an operating procedure for monetary policy through which the operating target is to be achieved .
The Reserve Bank shall be seen to have failed to meet the target if inflation remains above 6 per cent or below 2 per cent for three consecutive quarters .
In such circumstances , the Reserve Bank is required to provide the reasons for the failure , and propose remedial measures and the expected time to return inflation to the target .
The Reserve Bank shall publish a document explaining the sources of inflation as well as forecasts of inflation for the next six to eighteen months .
In August 2015 , the policy rate was kept unchanged while awaiting clarity on domestic and global developments and further transmission by banks .
The Reserve Bank front-loaded the policy action by effecting a 50 bps cut in the policy repo rate to boost domestic demand and stimulate investment .
From September onwards , inflation began rising prompting status quo on the policy rate in December 2015 .
The policy rate was kept unchanged in June 2016 in view of uncertainties due to larger than seasonal inflationary pressures emanating from food items and reversal in commodity prices .
Ill.5 = The goal of the operating framework of monetary policy is to modulate liquidity conditions in order to align the operating target - the WACR - closely with the policy repo rate .
During 2015-16 , a considerable flux in autonomous liquidity flows necessitated a pro-active assessment of liquidity conditions and nimble responses through a combination of regular facilities and fine-tuning operations in the form of variable rate repo / reverse repo auctions , drawing upon the revised liquidity framework instituted in September 2014 ( Chart IIl.1 ) .
The end-year spike in WACR was due to the usual build-up of cash balances by banks and the government .
Effective liquidity management , however , kept the WACR within + / - 10 bps and + / - 20 bps of the repo rate for 36 per cent and 79 per cent of the total number of trading days , respectively , during 2015-16 .
11.6 = With the institution of the revised liquidity management framework , the role of term repo auctions under the liquidity adjustment facility ( LAF ) has become significant .
Normal 14-day and fine tuning term repos of varying tenors ranging from 2 to 56-day accounted for about 90 per cent of the average net liquidity injection under the LAF during the year ( Chart III.2 ) .
Since July Limited ( FBIL ) has started compiling the Mumbai Inter-Bank Offer Rate ( MIBOR ) based on actual data of the interbank call market transactions covering a one hour time span - from 9.00 a.m.
Given the market microstructure , thick trading in the first hour usually elevates MIBOR above WACR ( Chart Ill.3 ) .
Il.7 = In April 2016 , the liquidity management framework was revised in a move to progressively Chart III.4 : FBIL Term Benchmarks lower the average ex ante liquidity deficit to a position closer to neutrality .
The Reserve Bank assured the market of meeting the requirements of durable liquidity and then using its fine-tuning operations to make short-term liquidity conditions consistent with the stated policy stance .
Accordingly , in Q1 of 2016-17 the Reserve Bank injected permanent liquidity of 805 billion through open market operations ( outright ) , more than offsetting the impact of currency leakage of * 696 billion during the same period .
For ensuring non- disruptive FCNR ( B ) redemptions , the Reserve Bank pro-actively injected € 100 billion through open market purchase auction on August 11 , 2016 .
With a view to further minimising volatility in WACR , as also easing liquidity management for banks without abandoning liquidity discipline , the minimum daily maintenance of the cash reserve ratio ( CRR ) was lowered from 95 per cent of the requirement to 90 per cent effective April 16 , 2016 .
Furthermore , the policy rate corridor around the repo rate was narrowed from + / -100 bps to + / - 50 bps .
11.8 During 2015-16 , as a part of the phased implementation of the liquidity coverage ratio ( LCR ) , the minimum required high quality liquid assets ( HQLA ) was raised from 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the total net cash outflow over the next 30 calendar days under the stress scenario limited the capacity of banks to use the excess statutory liquidity ratio ( SLR ) securities to access collateralised liquidity from money markets and the Reserve Bank .
On July 21 , 2016 , additional headroom equivalent to 1 per cent of NDTL was provided within the prescribed SLR .
Together , the total carve-out from SLR available to banks stands at 11 per cent of their NDTL , including 2 per cent of NDTL available under MSF .
The weighted average lending rate ( WALR ) on fresh rupee loans declined by 100 bps ( up to June 2016 ) , significantly more than the decline of 65 bps in WALR on outstanding rupee loans .
Ill.10 Since December 2014 , lending rates across various sectors ( except credit card ) have declined in the range of 16-110 bps , reflecting Table Ill.1 : Deposit and Lending Rates of End-Month Repo Term Deposit Rates Lending Rates Median WADTDR Median WALR WALR Variation -1.50 -0.92 -1.12 -0.60 -0.65 -1.00 WADTDR : Weighted average domestic term deposit rate .
the varied credit conditions and risk appetite of banks ( Table III.2 ) .
Interest rates on fresh rupee loans sanctioned for housing - personal and commercial - declined more than that of the respective categories of vehicle loans ( Table III.3 ) .
Ill.12 Under the MCLR system , banks determine their benchmark lending rates linked to marginal cost of funds which is more sensitive to changes in the policy rate , unlike the earlier base rate system where banks adopted different methodologies ( average / marginal / blended principles ) for computing their cost of funds .
MCLR consists of four components : ( a ) marginal cost of funds ( marginal cost of borrowings comprising deposits and other borrowings , and return on net worth ) , ( b ) negative carry on account of CRR , ( c ) operating costs and ( d ) term premium .
The MCLR plus spread is the actual lending rates for borrowers .
The spread comprises of only two components , viz . , business strategy and credit risk premium .
Moreover , banks may have been loading ( i ) a higher credit risk premia on their new customers in order to attain their desired return on net worth in a rising NPA environment ; and / or ( ii ) a higher strategic risk premia on their riskier loans as part of their business strategy to reorient their lending operations towards less risky activities .
The consequent rise in the spread is reflected in a near unchanged WALR in respect of both outstanding and fresh rupee loans during 2016-17 so far ( up to June ) .
111.15 Inacompetitive environment , it is expected that the return on net worth of banks would vary in a narrow range .
Data for the month of June 2016 , however , show wide variations in the expected return on net worth - between 0.33 per cent and 26.44 per cent ( Table III.5 ) .
I1l.16 In the first bi-monthly policy statement for 2016-17 , the Reserve Bank set a target for CPI inflation at 5 per cent by March 2017 .
The eventual aim is to move towards 4 per cent CPI inflation by the end of 2017-18 .
Ill.17 To strengthen the monetary policy framework , the Union Budget 2016-17 announced the formal constitution of a Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) by amending the RBI Act , 1934 , which will be vested with the responsibility of setting Table III.5 : Return on Net Worth Expected by the policy rate .
With the introduction of MPC , the decision making process will imbue diversity of views , specialised experience and independence of opinion , which will bring transparency to the overall decision-making process .
In this context , as the cross-country experience shows , there is an increasing recognition of the merit in following a collegial approach to monetary policy decision making , irrespective of whether the countries are following inflation targeting or not ( Box III.2 ) .
MPC is a new institutional structure .
The MPC shall consist of the Governor of the Reserve Bank , the Deputy Governor-in-charge of monetary policy , one officer of the Bank to be nominated by the Central Board of the Reserve Bank and three members to be appointed by the Central Government .
Each member shall have one vote , and in the event of a tie , the Governor can exercise a casting or second vote .
It also represents a progressive graduation of the initial efforts towards collegial decision making under the aegis of the Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy .
The learning experience gained Committee Approach to Monetary Policy : International Experience A committee approach to monetary policy decisions has emerged as the preferred framework across the globe .
Even for countries like Canada , Israel and New Zealand where the Governor is responsible for decision making de jure , she / he is typically supported by an advisory committee de facto .

11.19 The revised liquidity management framework being implemented since April 2016 is expected to smoothen the supply of durable liquidity over the year and progressively lower the average ex ante liquidity deficit in the system to a position closer to neutrality .
This warrants continuous monitoring and preparedness to calibrate Table 1 : Structure of MPC in Select Countries Country Started Internal External Government External Decision Members Members Representa- Members Making Hungary 1993 4-6 1-3 No Fulltime Vv NA : Not applicable .
In particular , the risk of easy liquidity conditions either driving WACR below the repo rate or the associated lower term repo auction volumes dampening the prospect of development of a term money market will have to be avoided .
The Reserve Bank will objectively assess the efficacy of MCLR vis-a-vis the earlier base rate system in terms of monetary policy transmission .
During 2015-16 , the Reserve Bank intensified its efforts towards expanding formal banking facilities covering hitherto excluded sections of society .
Greater focus was placed on ensuring adequate credit flow to various segments in the priority sectors .
Measures such as introduction of Priority Sector Lending Certificates ( PSLCs ) and implementation of the recommendations of the Committee on Medium Term Path on Financial Inclusion are expected to provide further impetus to financial inclusion in the country .
IV.19 The Reserve Bank continued its focus on ensuring the availability of banking services throughout the country and instituting an efficient and comprehensive credit delivery mechanism catering to the productive sectors of the economy .
During 2015-16 , efforts were directed at fostering a more conducive environment for flow of credit to priority sectors , in particular to the micro , small and medium enterprises ( MSME ) sector .
A national programme for capacity building of bankers was launched with the sole objective of upgrading skills related to the financing of the MSME sector .
The Committee on Medium-Term Path on Financial Inclusion submitted its report charting out a measurable action plan for financial inclusion that will guide the financial inclusion process going forward .
The Financial Inclusion and Development Department ( FIDD ) is the nodal department for the seamless implementation of the Reserve Bank ' s financial inclusion agenda .
During 2015-16 , PSLCs were introduced as a mechanism for incentivising banks having surplus in lending ' to different categories of the priority sector thereby enhancing lending to these sectors ( Box IV.1 ) .
For trading purposes , a dedicated portal was launched in April 2016 .
IV.3 In August 2015 , the banks were advised to review their existing lending policies to the micro and small enterprises ( MSEs ) sector and fine-tune them by allowing for standby credit facilities in case of term loans , additional working capital limits , mid-term review of regular working capital limits and timelines for credit decisions .
Subsequent to the notification of a ' Framework for Revival and Rehabilitation of Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises ' by the Government to provide a simpler and faster mechanism for addressing the stress in MSME accounts , the Reserve Bank issued related guidelines along with operating framework , the revival and rehabilitation of MSME | For instance , a bank with expertise in lending to small farmers can over-perform there and get benefits by selling its over-performance through PSLCs .
Priority Sector Lending Certificates ( PSLCs ) A scheme of PSLCs was introduced in April 2016 .
The Reserve Bank provided a platform to enable trading in the certificates through its core banking solution ( CBS ) portal ( e-Kuber ) .
All scheduled commercial banks ( including RRBs ) , urban co-operative banks , small finance banks ( when they become operational ) and local area banks are eligible to participate in trading .
Some of the main features e Four kinds of PSLCs : Agriculture , Small and Marginal farmers ( SF / MF ) , Micro enterprises and General can be bought and sold wa the platform .
e The certificates will have a standard lot size of % 2.5 million and its multiples .
e There will be no transfer of credit risk on underlying assets as there is no transfer of tangible assets or related cash flows .
e Banks will be permitted to issue PSLCs up to 50 per cent of the previous year ' s priority sector lending units having loan limits up to $ 250 million will be undertaken .
Banks were also required to put in place Board approved policies to operationalise the framework not later than June 30 , 2016 .
IV.4 In a move to boost entrepreneurial sensitivity among banks ' field-level functionaries , the Reserve Bank in collaboration with the College of Agricultural Banking ( CAB ) , Pune , launched the National Mission for Capacity Building of Bankers for financing the MSME sector ( NAMCABS ) .
Since its inception , NAMCABS has imparted training to about 3,000 bankers .
Natural Calamities and Policy Response IV.5 Following the Government ' s revision of the criteria for crop loss from 50 per cent to 33 per cent for providing input subsidies ( compensation ) to farmers , State Level Bankers ' Committees / District Level Consultative Committees / banks were allowed to take a view on rescheduling of loans if the crop loss turned out to be 33 per cent or achievement without having the underlying in their books .
e Banks may be required to invest in the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund ( RIDF ) / other funds to the extent of the shortfall .
e A bank with a shortfall in achieving any sub-target ( for example , SF / MF , micro enterprises ) will have to buy specific PSLCs to achieve the target .
However , if a bank has a shortfall only with respect to the overall target , it could buy any PSLC .
e PSLCs will not be valid beyond the reporting date ( March 31 ) , irrespective of the date of first sale .
e A bank ' s priority sector lending achievement will be computed as the sum of outstanding priority sector loans and the net nominal value of the PSLCs issued and purchased .
Such computation will be done separately where sub-targets are prescribed as on the reporting date .
Banks were permitted to allow a maximum period of repayment of up to two years ( including the moratorium period of one year ) if the loss was between 33 per cent and 50 per cent .
If the crop loss is 50 per cent or more , the restructured period for repayment can be extended to a maximum of five years ( including the moratorium period of one year ) .
IV.6 The objective of priority sector lending is to ensure that timely and adequate credit is available to vulnerable sections of society .
Usually these categories of people / activities are unable to access credit due to a perceived lack of viability and creditworthiness even though there are some recent signs of improvement on this front ( Box IV.2 ) .
Bank Credit to Small Borrowers : Some Insights The term ' small ' in ' small borrowers ' has been redefined from time to time .
Currently , accounts with a credit limit of 200,000 are taken as small borrowal accounts ( SBAs ) .
The credit limit for SBAs was % 25,000 till 1998 and % 10,000 till 1983 .
There has been a fall in the share of SBAs in total loan accounts and amount since the 1990s ( Charts 1 and 2 ) .
However , real bank credit per SBA has been on the rise in rural areas ; this is contrary to the trend in urban areas ( Chart 3 ) .
Secondly , gender disparities in bank credit too appear to have been on a decline in rural areas .
On average , for every 100 SBAs held by rural men , rural women held about 32 accounts in 2015 .
Thirdly , the ratio of bank credit per capita ( under SBA ) for rural women to urban women has also been largely on a rising trend ( Chart 4 ) .
This underlines the need for focused attention to urban poor , keeping in view the increasing urbanisation .
Besides expanding the branch network , tailor-made platforms and products need to be designed to reach out to small borrowers in urban areas , including slum-dwellers and domestic workers .

IV.9 Reflecting several of the Government ' s initiatives for the MSME sector , such as ' Make in India ' , ' Start-up India ' , ' Ease of Doing Business ' and ' Udyog Aadhar ' , which were reinforced by the Reserve Bank ' s initiatives such as capacity building of field level banking functionaries , Table IV.2 : Targets and Achievements for Year Scheduled Cooperative Regional Total Target Achieve- Target Achieve- Target Achieve- Target Achieve- * : Provisional .

addressing life-cycle needs of enterprises and providing simpler and faster mechanisms to address the stress in MSME accounts , credit to this sector has improved in recent times ( Table Studies on the Efficacy of Credit Delivery Models IV.10 A number of studies were commissioned during the year to assess the efficacy of various schemes and models for credit delivery and financial inclusion - the business correspondent ( BC ) model , self-help group ( SHG ) -bank linkage programme , credit guarantee trust for micro and small enterprises ( CGTMSE ) , and the lead bank scheme .
A study on farmers ' funding requirements was also undertaken in collaboration with CAB , Pune .
IV.11 The study on the efficacy of the BC model brought out the need for certification-training programmes for BCs along with providing them other support in terms of timely and adequate remuneration , effective ways of cash management and improving the acceptance infrastructure and technology .
The need for creating a BC registry and effective monitoring and supervision involving banks were also highlighted in the study .
The study on the efficacy of SHG-bank linkage found that banks could consider appointing Bank Mitras functioning under the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods Mission ( DAY- NRLM ) as BC agents so that they can formally transact the banking business for SHG members as well as for other customers of banks in a specific area .
The study also recommended that the SHG-bank linkage activity may be treated as corporate social responsibility .
Furthermore , there could be an SHG specific mark for every product involving the engagement of SHGs .
A cadre of last mile delivery nodes may be created by leveraging the BC model .
IV.12 The Reserve Bank continued its efforts towards fulfilling the financial inclusion agenda during the year .
In this direction , the Committee on Medium-Term Path on Financial Inclusion suggested improvements in the governance system as a means of strengthening credit infrastructure and augmenting the government ' s social cash transfers to the poor , propelling the economy on to a medium-term sustainable inclusion path ( Box IV.3 ) .
The Financial Inclusion Plan ( FIP ) provides a structured and planned approach to financial inclusion with a commitment at the highest echelons within banks in terms of Board approval of the plans .
Out of 2,259 rural bank branches opened during April 2015-March 2016 , 1,670 branches were opened in unbanked rural centres under FIP .
Around 71 million basic savings bank deposit accounts were added taking the total to 469 million by March 2016 .
The total number Committee on Medium-Term Path on Financial Inclusion The Committee on Medium-Term Path on Financial Inclusion ( Chairman : Shri Deepak Mohanty ) which was constituted to work out a medium-term ( five year ) measurable action plan for financial inclusion , submitted its report in December 2015 .
The Committee recognised that substantial progress had been made in terms of access to financial products and services especially after the launch of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana ( PMJDY ) .
The Committee identified significant gaps in terms of usage , inadequate ' last mile ' service delivery , exclusion of women and small and marginal farmers and a very low formal link for micro and small enterprises .
Against this background , the committee set a much wider vision of financial inclusion as ' convenient ' access to a basket of basic formal financial products and services that should include savings , remittances , credit , government-supported insurance and pension products to small and marginal farmers and low- income households at reasonable costs with adequate protection progressively supplemented by social cash transfers .
A low-cost solution based on mobile technology for enhancing the effectiveness of last mile delivery as also to facilitate usage .
An open specialised interest-free window with simple products like demand deposits , agency and participation securities , offering products based on cost-plus financing , deferred payment and deferred delivery contracts .
Exploring asystem of professional credit intermediaries / advisors for MSMEs to help bridge the information gap and thereby help banks take better credit decisions .
Creating a registry for BCs , encouraging BC certification / training programmes .
Strengthening the financial literacy centre ( FLC ) network and grievance redressal mechanism and devising a scheme based on transparent criteria that incentivises banks to expeditiously address customer grievances .
At end-March 2016 , as reported by the State Level Bankers ' Committees ( SLBCs ) , 450,686 villages ( 91.9 per cent of the target ) had been covered by 14,901 branches , 415,207 villages through BCs and 20,578 villages through other modes such as ATMs and mobile vans .
Keeping in view the necessity of brick and mortar branches for promoting banking penetration and financial inclusion , a roadmap for establishing such branches in villages with population above 5,000 but without a bank branch of a scheduled commercial bank was rolled out in December 2015 .
SLBC convenor banks have been advised to ensure opening of bank branches under this roadmap by March 2017 .
Financial Inclusion Advisory Committee ( FIAC ) IV.15 The Reserve Bank set up an advisory body , the FIAC , in 2012 to review financial inclusion policies on an on-going basis and to provide expert advice to the Reserve Bank in this matter .
Financial Inclusion Fund ( FIF ) IV.16 The financial inclusion fund ( FIF ) and the financial inclusion technology fund ( FITF ) were set up in 2007-08 for a period of five years with a corpus of ¥ 5 billion for each to be contributed by the Government of India , the Reserve Bank and NABARD in the ratio of 40 : 40 : 20 .
The Government of India merged FIF and FITF to form a single financial inclusion fund in July 2015 with a corpus of % 20 billion .
The new FIF , which will be administered by an advisory Board constituted by the Government , will be maintained by NABARD .
The fund will be in operation for another three years or till such period as may be decided by the Government of India and the Reserve Bank in consultation with other stakeholders .
FIF aims to support developmental and promotional activities leading to greater financial inclusion , for example , the creation of Fl infrastructure across the country , capacity building of stakeholders , spreading awareness to address demand side issues , enhanced investments in green information and communication technology ( ICT ) solutions , research and transfer of technology and improving the technological absorption capacity of financial service providers / users .
The fund will not be utilised for normal business / banking activities .
IV.17 Financial literacy is crucial for imparting efficacy to financial inclusion initiatives .
In the context of a changing financial landscape , especially with the introduction of PMJDY , the emphasis is on keeping new bank accounts operationally active .
Banks were , accordingly , advised in January 2016 to focus on enhancing the efficacy of financial literacy programmes through : ( i ) Board-level policies for a stronger financial literacy architecture ; ( ii ) a tailor-made approach to financial literacy and organising camps for different target groups ; and ( iii ) following a concerted approach among various stakeholders at the district / panchayat / village level ( local officials of NABARD and the Reserve Bank , district and local administration , block level officials , NGOs , SHGs , BCs , farmers ' clubs , panchayats , primary agricultural credit society ( PACS ) , and village level functionaries ) .
literacy centres ( FLCs ) were operational in the country , up from 1,181 FLCs at end-March 2015 .
During the year ended March 2016 , 87,710 financial literacy activities were conducted by FLCs as against 84,089 activities during the preceding year .
IV.19 Going forward , an action plan based on the recommendations of the Committee on Medium- Term Path on Financial Inclusion will be worked out .
Three recommendations of the committee , viz . , creating a BC registry ; formalising certification- training programmes for BCs ; and designing a framework for accreditation of credit counsellors have been identified for immediate implementation .
Formulating a National Strategy for Financial Inclusion , which forms part of the revised terms of reference of FIAC , will be taken up during the year .
District level data on the progress made by banks under FIP will also be collected for better monitoring of banks ' FI initiatives .
As an impetus to financial literacy activities , capacity building programmes for financial literacy counsellors will be launched in collaboration with CAB , Pune .
During 2015-16 , the Reserve Bank undertook measures aimed at broadening participation - both domestic and foreign , widening the range of products and bolstering the financial market infrastructure .
Initiatives in the money market included proactive liquidity management , providing market participants more flexibility , reducing volatility and improving transmussion of monetary policy signals .
The regulatory regime for the foreign exchange market was further streamlined in terms of rules for transactions and reporting requirements .
V1 The Reserve Bank has , over time , guided and nurtured the evolution of financial markets in India in tune with the needs of a growing economy , but making them more accessible and globally integrated has been a recent focus .
Efforts have also been directed at improving ease of doing business by way of rationalising existing regulations on an on-going basis and simplifying documentation requirements .
At the same time , steps have also been taken to render the financial markets more resilient to external as well as internal shocks .
V.2 FMRDis primarily responsible for regulating and developing money , government securities ( g-secs ) , foreign exchange and related derivatives markets .
The department took concerted steps to fulfil its mandate of easing market norms for all participants , improving accessibility , increasing the number of financial products , strengthening market infrastructure as also employing market analytics and surveillance mechanism for policy inputs .
Agenda 2015-16 : Implementation Status V.3 Towards developing a more predictable investment regime , a medium-term framework ( MTF ) was announced in October 2015 for a phased increase in foreign portfolio investment limits for central government securities and state development loans .
( CCIL ) was advised to enable participation of demat account holders in negotiated dealing system order- matching ( NDS-OM ) .
V.4 A Working Group ( Chairman : Harun R. Khan ) , set up under the aegis of the Financial Stability and Development Council Sub-committee ( FSDC-SC ) considered several measures for strengthening participation , improving market infrastructure and easing the issuance process for corporate bonds .
Unlisted securities and securitised debt instruments will shortly be added to the basket of corporate debt for foreign portfolio investor ( FPI ) investments .
Comments were sought from market participants on the recommendations of the Working Group on Introduction of Interest Rate Options ( Chairman : Professor P.G.
V.6 With a view to further liberalising existing hedging facilities and harmonising the OTC and exchange traded markets , the limits for all resident individuals , firms and companies to book foreign exchange forwards and foreign currency-Indian rupee ( FCY-INR ) options contracts on the basis of declaration have been increased from US $ 250,000 to US $ 1,000,000 .
Indian residents having long term foreign currency ( FCY ) borrowings were permitted to enter into FCY-INR swaps with multilateral or international financial institutions ( MFIs / IFIs ) , in which the Government of India is a shareholding member provided such swaps were undertaken by the MFI / IFI concerned on a back-to-back basis with an authorised dealer ( AD ) Category- | bank in India .
V.7 Existing guidelines on various financial instruments were comprehensively reviewed with a view to rationalising participation .
Primary dealers ( PDs ) were allowed to participate in exchange traded currency futures market .
For a more broad based participation in OTC derivatives , regulated entities other than banks and PDs such as mutual funds and insurance companies have been enabled to trade in such derivatives on electronic platforms with guaranteed settlements by the CCIL .
V.8 Ina move to a more informed policy making process , a standing group on OTC derivatives reforms was constituted under the Technical Advisory Committee on Financial Markets .
( FBIL ) took over the administration of the benchmark for the overnight inter-bank rate based on the actual traded rates on July 22 , 2015 , replacing the existing ' FIMMDA-NSE Overnight MIBID / MIBOR ' by ' FBIL-Overnight MIBOR ' .
FBIL started publishing the polled term Mumbai interbank offer rate ( MIBOR ) for three tenors , viz . , 14-day , one month and three months from efforts , it started publishing the FBIL FC-Rupee Options Volatility Matrix rates from May 05 , 2016 .
FBIL proposes to take over the administration of foreign exchange benchmarks and other Indian rupee ( INR ) interest rate benchmarks over a period of time in consultation with the stakeholders .
The CCIL trade repository expanded the public dissemination of data on a gross basis in pursuit of enhanced transparency .
In addition to data on interbank OTC trades on interest rate swaps / forward rate agreements , credit default swaps ( CDS ) and USD / INR forwards and options , CCIL has also started disseminating data on short term USD / INR interbank near maturity swaps , i.e. , Cash-Tom , Tom-Spot and Cash-Spot from December 28 , 2015 .
V.10 Initiatives currently under consideration include changes in e-Kuber to facilitate seamless transfer of g-secs between demat accounts and subsidiary general ledger / gilt accounts and operationalising electronic platforms for repo in corporate bonds in coordination with the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) .
Public feedback on the draft framework to comprehensively review documentation requirements in the OTC foreign exchange market has been received and is being examined for implementation .
Guidelines on commercial paper ( CP ) , CDS and Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities ( STRIPS ) will be reviewed to bolster trading activity in these products .
Guidelines on currency options relating to suitability and appropriateness will be revisited to make them less restrictive .
Taking into account the feedback received from the market , final guidelines on introduction of interest rate options will be issued .
In order to further develop the rupee futures market , money market futures will be introduced .
V.11 - In fulfilment of the G20 mandate for shifting OTC derivatives on to exchanges or electronic trading platforms , where appropriate , a framework for authorisation of such platforms will be put in place .
The legal entity identifier ( LEI ) uniquely identifies parties to financial transactions globally , the need for which was felt in the aftermath of the global financial crisis .
The implementation of the LEI regime for financial market entities will begin during the year .
The scope of dissemination of OTC forex derivative transactions by the CCIL Trade Repository will be expanded .
V.12 Market surveillance will be strengthened through use of technology .
Data analytics will be leveraged to enhance surveillance capabilities across market segments .
Towards leveraging the benefits of Fin Tech , the adoption of various innovations in strengthening market infrastructure will be explored by engaging with industry participants and other central banks .
V.13 Exposure of Indian entities to commodity price risks has been accentuated by the growing integration of the Indian economy with the rest of the world and increasing volumes of cross border trade .
An expert group will be set up to review the existing framework for hedging of commodity price risks by Indian entities in the overseas markets with the objective of addressing the gaps in terms of commodities covered , permitted products and users .
V.14 FMOD is responsible for conducting financial markets operations in consonance with the policy stance of the Reserve Bank for supporting monetary policy transmission .
Agenda 2015-16 : Implementation Status Money Markets and Liquidity Management V.15 Efforts at maintaining appropriate level of liquidity in the financial system continued through liquidity management operations , using the fixed / variable rate repo / reverse repo under liquidity adjustment facility ( LAF ) , the overnight marginal standing facility ( MSF ) , other standing facilities and outright open market operations ( OMOs ) with a view to aligning money market rates with the policy rate for more efficient transmission of monetary policy signals .
Towards promoting the term money segment while keeping in view evolving liquidity conditions , a 56-day variable rate repo was conducted in January 2016 .
As part of the technological up-gradation for smoothening liquidity operations , straight through processing ( STP ) was introduced for fixed rate repo and reverse repo , and MSF on August 03 , 2015 , enabling eligible participants to receive credit / debit immediately on placement of bids / offers .
More flexibility was imparted to LAF / MSF windows with the extension of timing from November 30 , 2015 .
V.16 With the second and the fourth Saturdays every month being public holidays for banks under Section 25 of the Negotiable Instruments Act , 1881 , it was decided to keep open all money market segments on the working Saturdays from operations with the payment system , reverse repo and MSF are being conducted from February 19 , 2016 on all Mumbai holidays when the real time gross settlement ( RTGS ) system is in operation .
V.17 | The Committee on Financial Benchmarks ( Chairman : Shri P. Vijaya Bhaskar ) constituted by the Reserve Bank to study various issues relating to financial benchmarks in India recommended that the derivation of the USD / INR RBI reference rate should be based on actual market transactions so as to ensure that it appropriately represents the prevailing spot rate .
Accordingly , from May 02 , 2016 , the Reserve Bank reference rate is being computed on the basis of the volume weighted average of the actual market transactions that have taken place during a randomly selected 15-minute window between 11.30 a.m.
The other three reference rates , viz . , EUR / INR , GBP / INR and JPY / INR will continue to be computed by crossing the USD / INR reference rate with the ruling EUR / USD , GBP / USD and USD / JPY rates .
As an additional instrument to address the volatility in the foreign exchange market , intervention in the exchange traded currency derivatives ( ETCD ) segment commenced in September 2015 .
Over the last few months , it has proved to be a useful supplementary tool .
V.19 The department aims to carry out liquidity management operations effectively as per the revised framework , which entails , inter alia , lowering the average ex-ante liquidity deficit in the system to a position closer to neutrality by supplying durable liquidity over the year .
The department will be watchful of market conditions to ensure smooth unwinding of concessional foreign exchange swaps against foreign currency non resident ( bank ) account [ FCNR ( B ) ] deposits maturing from September 2016 onwards .
It has taken up a number of research studies on market movements / behaviour over the year which has helped in shaping the policy and operational framework .
The department proposes to continue policy oriented research on financial markets .
V.21 The mandate of the FED is to promote the orderly development and maintenance of the foreign exchange market in India and to facilitate external trade and payments .
Accordingly , the measures undertaken during 2015-16 aimed at promoting ease of doing business , focusing particularly on dealing with increasing complexities of international transactions and also reducing the regulatory costs by rationalising , reviewing and revising regulations and returns .
Agenda 2015-16 : Implementation Status V.22 The guidelines on external commercial borrowings ( ECBs ) were rationalised and liberalised during 2015-16 in tune with macroeconomic developments and the experience gained in administering ECBs over the years .
The overarching principles of the revised framework for ECBs are : ( i ) fewer restrictions on end-uses , higher all-in-cost ceiling for long term FCY borrowings as the extended term makes repayments more sustainable and minimises rollover risks for a borrower ; ( ii ) a more liberal approach for INR denominated ECBs where the currency risk is borne by the lender ; ( iii ) expansion of the list of eligible overseas lenders to include long term lenders like sovereign wealth funds and pension funds ; and ( iv ) alignment of the list of infrastructure entities eligible for ECBs with the harmonised list of the Government of India .
V.23 To provide greater flexibility in structuring of trade credit arrangements for imports , resident importers were allowed to raise trade credits in INR allowing the transfer of currency risk to overseas lenders .
To facilitate rupee denominated borrowings / bonds from abroad , a framework for such issuance has been put in place with defined parameters such as eligible borrowers , recognised investors , maturity , amount and end-uses ( Box V.1 ) .
V.24 After the operationalisation of the export data processing and monitoring system ( EDPMS ) , leading to improved monitoring of export transactions , an analogous information technology based system for monitoring import transactions [ import data processing and monitoring system ( IDPMS ) ] , is being operationalised .
V.25 The Foreign Exchange Management Act ( FEMA ) , 1999 enacted with 25 original notifications has since undergone over 300 amendments .
In this context , the task of rationalising FEMA notifications ( which are subordinate legislations ) was undertaken .
So far 15 original notifications and 95 amendments thereof have been rationalised and consolidated into 13 notifications with ' R ' series .
In addition , 17 Master Directions covering foreign exchange transactions have been issued Foreign currency denominated funding through debt - including external commercial borrowings ( ECBs ) , trade credits and bonds - accounts for about one-fifth of the total corporate funding in India ( IMF , 2016 ) .
Corporates are thus exposed to exchange rate risks , if insufficiently hedged .
This makes a case for raising foreign debt ( both contractual and marketable ) in Indian rupees .
Issuers from a few countries have floated offshore local currency bonds in recent years .
However , such issuances have not grown significantly , except in China .
Efforts by Chinese authorities to internationalise the Chinese yuan ( CNY ) , a large offshore Renminbi deposit base and gradual CNY appreciation during 2010-14 led to a surge in issuances of offshore CNY bonds .
However , CNY depreciation , default by some Chinese entities and improved access to local markets have dampened investor appetite recently .
In 2015 , offshore CNY bond issuances slumped to USD equivalent 17 billion after hitting a record USD equivalent 33 billion in 2014 with no new issuances in the first two months of 2016 .
Mexico , Brazil and Philippines have also seen some amount of offshore local currency bond issuances .
In summary , offshore domestic currency bonds still form a very small portion of issuances from emerging market countries .
In India , while rupee denominated contractual borrowings from abroad were permitted in September 2011 , in September 2015 the Reserve Bank also allowed Indian entities to issue rupee denominated bonds overseas .
Prior to this general permission by the Reserve Bank , international financial institutions like the Asian Development Bank and the International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) had already obtained permission from the Reserve Bank to issue rupee denominated bonds overseas .
IFC , which named its rupee denominated bonds as ' Masala Bonds ' , has been successful in issuing such bonds on multiple occasions with maturity as long as 15 years .
Foreign investors already involved in the Indian domestic currency space could also be interested in the overseas rupee product .
Rupee bonds overseas offer ease of access compared to the process of direct investments in India ( registration as a foreign portfolio investor ( FPI ) and involvement of domestic custodians and brokers and local settlement systems ) .
With restrictions primarily in the form of minimum maturity and no restrictions on cost and end- uses virtually opened up , the window for rupee denominated bonds overseas is expected to become a meeting ground for fund seeking Indian corporates and return seeking foreign investors .
The window which witnessed initial activities in the form of private placements of bonds overseas , has gathered steam with diverse offshore investors now getting interested in rupee denominated paper of Indian companies .
Total agreements for such papers till the first week of August 2016 by Indian companies were to the tune of % 60 billion .
The borrowings would help in discovery of benchmark rates .
Furthermore , applications received from citizens of / companies registered in Bangladesh , Sri Lanka , Afghanistan , lran , China , Hong Kong or Macau for opening offices in Jammu and Kashmir , the Northeast region , and Andaman and Nicobar Islands would require the prior approval of the Reserve Bank .
Non-Resident Deposits and Foreign Currency V.30 Transfers between non-resident ordinary rupee ( NRO ) accounts have been permitted .
Further , NRIs and persons of Indian origin ( PIOs ) have been permitted to open NRO accounts jointly with other NRIs / PIOs .
While permitting remittances outside the country from the balances held in NRO accounts maintained by NRIs and P ! Os , ADs are now required to obtain a declaration that the remittances represent the account holder ' s legitimate receivables in India and do not represent any borrowing from any other person or transfer from any other NRO account .
Non-residents having a business interest in India are permitted to open a repatriable special non-resident rupee ( SNRR ) account with balances commensurate with business operations .
An Indian company receiving foreign investment under the FDI route has been permitted to open and maintain an FCY account with an AD in India provided it has impending FCY expenditure .
The account needs to be closed immediately after the requirements are completed or within six months from the date of opening of such account , whichever is earlier .
V.33 Guidelines were issued to banks for settling export / import transactions where the invoicing is in a freely convertible currency and the settlement takes place in the currency of the beneficiary , which though convertible , does not have a direct exchange rate .
V.34 To ease operational difficulties faced by importers of rough , cut and polished diamonds , AD banks have been delegated the powers to permit clean credit for an additional period of up to 180 days over and above the 180 days prescribed period , subject to certain conditions .
V.35 Towards rationalisation of returns and liberalisation of procedures , the physical filing of three FDI related returns , viz . , advance remittance form ( ARF ) , form foreign currency gross provisional return ( FC-GPR ) and form foreign currency transfer of shares ( FC-TRS ) has been replaced with online filing on the Government ' s e-Biz portal .
Reporting by AD banks to the Reserve Bank under the Diamond Dollar Account scheme has been dispensed with .
Filing of returns showing details of trade related loans and advances by exporters to overseas importers from their EEFC accounts has also been dispensed with .
The submission of documents by full-fledged money changers ( FFMC ) / AD Category-Il while opening additional branches has been relaxed while the single / bulk filing of the SOFTEX form for certification has been made available to all software exporters .
For the general public ' s information , the guidance note on the methodology used for calculating the amount imposed under the compounding process has been hosted on the Reserve Bank website .
V.37 To further facilitate trade , payments and investments , the department will : ( i ) complete the task of rationalising and simplifying notifications issued under FEMA ; ( ii ) rationalise returns to reduce the regulatory burden on users of foreign exchange ; ( iii ) operationalise IDPMS for monitoring of import transactions and ( iv ) put in place a simplified revised framework for dealing with delayed reporting of FDI transactions .
Furthermore , proposals with respect to startups as mentioned above ( para V.28 ) will be implemented in consultation with the government .
Despite a moderate revival in economic activity coupled with an upturn in credit growth during the year , the Indian banking sector continued to battle with significant deterioration in loan quality .
Consequently , the Reserve Bank had to undertake supervisory measures including an asset quality review ( AQR ) for restoring the health of the banking system over the medium term .
On the regulatory front , the Reserve Bank continued its efforts to strengthen the prudential policy framework to effectively address the challenge of rising stressed assets and facilitate the restoration of stalled projects .
The process of transition of banks in India to the Indian Accounting Standards ( Ind AS ) converged with International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) was initiated .
With the olyective of encouraging competition while reducing regulatory arbitrage , the process of aligning the regulatory frameworks for various segments of the financial system was carried forward .
The year also witnessed complete operationalisation of the Charter of Customer Rights , which will play a pivotal role in ensuring consumer protection in the banking sector in the years to come .
VI.1 Notwithstanding the moderate pick-up in entry of new players in the banking sector with economic growth and credit conditions , the banking the establishment of small finance and payments sector continued to grapple with the challenge of banks .
To address the concerns of asset quality , the Reserve Bank initiated supervisory action in the form of an asset quality review ( AQR ) during the population , and thereby further financial inclusion while fostering competition in the banking sector .
VI.5 The Financial Stability Unit ( FSU ) within the Reserve Bank is entrusted with the responsibility of macro-prudential surveillance through systemic stress tests and other tools as well as dissemination of information relating to the status of and challenges to financial stability through the bi-annual Financial Stability Report ( FSR ) .
It also acts as a secretariat to the Sub- Committee of the apex institutional mechanism for financial stability in the country , viz . , the Financial Stability and Development Council ( FSDC ) .
Agenda for 2015-16 : Implementation Status VI.6 = In 2015-16 , the FSR was published in December 2015 ( along with the Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India ) and June 2016 , as planned .
In addition , distress in select industrial sectors and its impact on the banking sector was examined .
VI.7 The Sub-Committee of FSDC held two meetings in 2015-16 and reviewed various issues relating to , inter alia , central Know your customer registry ( CKYCR ) , International Financial Services Centre , development of corporate bond market , peer-to-peer ( P2P ) lending , regulation of credit guarantee schemes , risks in deposit mobilisation by multi-state co-operative societies and the Stewardship Code . ' The Sub-Committee recommended the formation of an inter-regulatory group on financial technology ( Fin Tech ) to examine the models followed internationally and determine an appropriate regulatory framework in this regard ( also see Box VI.2 ) .
The Sub-Committee also agreed to set up a working group to formulate an effective and comprehensive ' National Gold Policy ' .
Furthermore , a Working Group on Corporate Bonds ( Chairman : H. R. Khan ) with representation from the central government and various financial sector regulators was constituted following the recommendations of the Sub-Committee .
Through its two meetings , the Inter- Regulatory Technical Group ( IRTG ) - a sub-group of the FSDC Sub-Committee - deliberated upon a range of issues , such as legal entity identifier ( LEl ) , a regulatory framework for NBFC-account aggregator ( AA ) , securitisation , a single entity undertaking multiple activities and progress on the Shadow Banking Implementation Group .
VI.9 Going forward , besides macro-prudential surveillance , the publication of the bi-annual FSR is envisaged along with conducting meetings of the FSDC Sub-Committee .
The study of select industries , especially with regard to the banking sector ' s exposure to these industries , will also be undertaken during the year .
Commercial Banks : Department of Banking Vl.10 DBR , which is the nodal department for regulation of commercial banks , has been proactively addressing both the time and cross- sectional dimensions of risks to preserve systemic stability .
Apart from stability , its focus has also been on developing an inclusive and competitive banking structure through appropriate regulatory measures .
Agenda for 2015-16 : Implementation Status Financial Stress and Reinforcements Vi.11 During 2015-16 , the Reserve Bank continued to fortify the regulatory framework for dealing with stressed assets , inter alia , by way of a more effective joint lenders ' forum ( JLF ) with senior-level representation from banks , change of ownership in borrowing entities even outside the strategic debt restructuring ( SDR ) scheme , and specifying the criterion for divestment of banks ' holdings in favour of new promoters under the SDR scheme .
Furthermore , to strengthen the ability of lenders for deep financial restructuring , the Reserve Bank introduced the Scheme for Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets ( S4A ) .
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code was also passed during the year to strengthen the framework for resolution of corporate entities , partnership firms and individuals in a time-bound manner .
To further improve recovery , amendments to the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest ( GARFAESI ) Act , 2002 and Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions ( RDDBFI ) Act , 1993 have been passed by Parliament ( Box VI.1 ) .
Accordingly , the Enforcement of Security Interest and Recovery of Debts Laws and Miscellaneous Provisions ( Amendment ) Bill , 2016 has been passed by Parliament in August 2016 .
A. Amendments to the SARFAESI Act , 2002 are proposed to improve recovery and augment ease of doing business .
These , e Expeditious adjudication of recovery applications and empowering the central government to provide uniform procedural rules for conducting proceedings in Debt Recovery Tribunals ( DRTs ) and Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunals ( DRATs ) ; e Instituting electronic filing of recovery applications , documents and written statements ; issuing summons by the tribunals in electronic forms ; and display of interim and final orders of DRTs and DRATs on their e According priority to secured creditors in repayment of debts over all other claimants including claims of the central government , state government or local authorities .
VI.12 A discussion paper ( DP ) on ' Large Exposures Framework and Enhancing Credit Supply through Market Mechanism ' was released by the Reserve Bank in March 2015 .
VI.13 In view of the importance of concentration risks at the systemic level , a separate DP was also released in May 2016 on the ' Framework for Enhancing Credit Supply for Large Borrowers through Market Mechanism ' .
This DP defined a ' specified borrower and a ' normally permitted lending limit ) ( NPLL ) for such a _ borrower .
Furthermore , it proposed a _ disincentive mechanism for incremental borrowing by such a borrower from the banking system beyond NPLL .
Small Finance and Payments Banks VI.14 As part of its initiatives towards financial inclusion through a bouquet of banking products , including small credit , small savings and payments / remittances , the Reserve Bank issued in-principle approval for setting up of 11 payments banks and ten small finance banks ( SFBs ) in September 2015 and October 2015 , respectively .
The Reserve Bank also worked towards finalising the regulatory framework for these new entities .
Furthermore , in March 2016 , the first SFB licence was granted to Capital Small Finance Bank Limited - a case of conversion of a local area bank ( LAB ) into a SFB .
The first payments bank licence was granted to Airtel Payment Bank Lid .
In June 2016 , the second SFB licence was granted to Equitas Small Finance Bank .
VI.16 With the objective of encouraging greater competition and innovation in the banking system , guidelines for on-tap licensing of universal banks were released in August 2016 .
Apart from instituting a continuous process of licensing of banks in the private sector , these guidelines have mooted , inter alia , inclusion of resident individuals / professionals with experience in banking and finance but exclusion of large industrial / ousiness houses as eligible promoters , and making a non- operative financial holding company ( NOFHC ) mandatory only under certain conditions .
Transition to Indian Accounting Standards ( Ind AS ) VI.17 To pave the way for a time-bound transition of the existing accounting framework for banks in India to the Indian Accounting Standards ( Ind AS ) converged with IFRS , banks were advised in February 2016 to comply with the Ind AS in the preparation of financial statements for the comparatives for the period ending March 31 , 2018 .
Banks were also advised to initiate the implementation process with immediate effect under the oversight of the audit committees of their boards .
VI.18 Following the announcement in the Reserve Bank ' s Annual Report 2014-15 , ten Master Directions , viz . , on interest rate on deposits and advances ; KYC ( consolidating all relevant instructions issued by different departments of the Reserve Bank ) ; amalgamation ; issue and pricing of shares of private sector banks ; ownership in private sector banks ; prior approval for acquisition of shares or voting rights in private sector banks ; Gold Monetisation Scheme ; financial services provided by banks ; and presentation , disclosure and reporting by All-India Financial Institutions ( AIFls ) were issued during the year .
These directions are expected to impart more clarity and focus to communication with stakeholders .
Future of Local Area Banks ( LABs ) and Ownership VI.19 Consultations with the central government on broad options for the future set-up of LABs were underway during the year .
The extant guidelines on ownership in private sector banks were revisited with a view to meeting the need for additional capital consequent to the implementation of Basel Ill capital regulations and rationalisation of the ownership limits for these banks .
Governance Reforms in Public Sector Banks VI.20 Following the recommendations made by the Committee to Review Governance of Boards of Banks in India ( Chairman : Shri P. J. Nayak ) , the Banks Board Bureau ( BBB ) was set up by the central government with support from the Reserve Bank to infuse greater professionalism in the constitution and operation of the boards of PSBs .
The BBB started functioning from April 8 , 2016 .
VI.21 In pursuance of the regulatory stance in 2015-16 , the Reserve Bank will continue to monitor and respond to banks ' asset quality issues in 2016-17 .
Furthermore , the policy on prudential and implementation aspects of the expected credit loss ( ECL ) approach , as envisaged in Ind AS 109 , is intended to be finalised .
A review of the guidelines / instructions on various aspects relating to Ind AS will be undertaken during the year .
Efforts will also be initiated for capacity building on Ind AS both internally and in banks .
VI.22 Draft guidelines for computing exposure for counterparty credit risk ( CCR ) arising from derivative transactions and capital requirements for bank exposures to central counterparties ( CCPs ) were issued for comments in June 2016 .
The final guidelines shall be issued by end- December 2016 for implementation from April 1 , 2017 .
A discussion paper on margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives was also released in May 2016 .
Final guidelines in this regard will be issued during the first half of 2016- 17 .
Furthermore , draft guidelines on the LEF and the revised securitisation framework in alignment with the BCBS standards are also proposed to be issued during the year .
In May 2015 , draft guidelines on the net stable funding ratio ( NSFR ) were issued , taking into account the BCBS ' s final rules of October 2014 .
The objective of NSFR is to ensure that banks maintain stable funding profiles in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance sheet activities , limiting their over-reliance on short-term wholesale funding .
The final guidelines on NSFR will be issued in the second half of 2016- 17 after a consultative process , for implementation from January 1 , 2018 .
VlI.24 It is proposed to review and rationalise the branch authorisation framework for domestic scheduled commercial banks and the existing guidelines with regard to export credit .
It is also planned to extend the Basel Ill framework to AIFls in 2016-17 .
Banking , like many other fields , has been revolutionised by digital innovations in recent years .
To assess the potential in this sector , the Reserve Bank has set up an Inter-regulatory Working Group on Fin Tech and Digital Banking ( Box VI.2 ) .
The report of the Working Group will help in designing an appropriate regulatory framework for these innovative institutions and Fin Tech and Digital Innovation - Opportunities , Challenges and Risks Financial services , including banking services , are at the cusp of a revolutionary change driven by technological and digital innovations .
Fin Tech is an umbrella term coined to denote new competitors ( typically non-financial firms ) bringing technological innovations having a bearing on financial services .
Digital banking , block chain technology , distributed ledgers , big data and P2P / business-to- business ( B2B ) / business-to-consumers ( B2C ) platforms which bring together lenders and borrowers are some of the more recent innovations in Fin Tech .
These offer tremendous opportunities and benefits for the financial sector .
Convenience and speed of performance , real-time transactions , lower transaction costs , distributed ledger data availability for information and decision making , product tailoring and absence of intermediaries are some of the benefits of Fin Tech .
Fin Tech is of particular relevance in India given the national aspiration for universal financial inclusion , ensuring last mile reach of finance at affordable costs .
A combination of cloud computing , hand-held devices and mobile smartphones have aided the expansion of Fin Tech in India .
The possibilities of licensing other differentiated banks such as custodian banks , and wholesale and long-term financing banks will be explored in a paper to be released for comments by September 2016 .
VI.25 It is observed that some sections of the Indian society have remained financially excluded for religious reasons that preclude them from using banking products with an element of interest .
Towards mainstreaming these excluded sections , it is proposed to explore the modalities of introducing interest-free banking products in India in consultation with the Government .
The risks entailed therein are not just limited to technology but could , inter alia , involve : issues arising from transactions in financial products by unregulated financial and non-financial entities ; outsourcing of products / services ; and acquisition of software solutions without access to / awareness about source codes .
In view of the ' disruptive ' potential of Fin Tech , it is necessary to examine the need for regulation and design an appropriate regulatory framework , if required .
Hence , the Reserve Bank has set up an Inter-regulatory Working Group on Fin Tech and Digital Banking ( Chairman : Shri S. Sen ) in July 2016 .
The Group , inter alia , will assess the opportunities and risks from Fin Tech for customers and other stakeholders .
Furthermore , it will examine the implications and challenges of Fin Tech for various financial sector functions , including intermediation , clearing and payments being taken up by non-financial entities , and suggest appropriate regulatory response , if any .
In 2015-16 as well , DCBR , the department in- charge of prudential regulation of co-operative banks comprising urban co-operative banks ( UCBs ) , state co-operative banks ( StCBs ) and district central co-operative banks ( DCCBs ) , took several initiatives for strengthening the framework further .
Agenda for 2015-16 : Implementation Status VI.27 The report of the High Powered Committee on UCBs ( HPC ) was placed on the Bank ' s website and comments of the public were obtained .
A meeting was held in May 2016 with the stakeholders to elicit their views on the implementation of recommendations of the HPC .
Furthermore , workshops were conducted for statutory auditors of UCBs to improve the quality of audit .
Harmonisation of Regulatory Policies VI.28 The Reserve Bank has been in the process of harmonising regulations within the co-operative space , / .e. , between urban and rural co-operative banks as well as aligning regulations in a carefully calibrated manner between co-operative and commercial banks .
Accordingly , harmonisation of the following regulations was accomplished during the year : ( i ) valuation of gold jewellery accepted as security / collateral ; ( ii ) provision of internet banking to customers ; ( iii ) issue of ATM-cum-debit cards ; ( iv ) provision of value-added services through ATMs ; and ( v ) investments in market infrastructure companies ( MICs ) .
Revival and Licensing of Unlicensed DCCBs VI.29 In order to ensure that only licensed entities occupy the co-operative banking space in the interest of depositors , the licensing norms for co-operative banks were revised in 2009 .
For the revival and licensing of 23 DCCBs that continued to be unlicensed , a scheme was launched by the central government in 2014 , the details and outcome of which are given in Box VI.3.
Developments relating to Scheduling , Licensing VI.380 Five non-scheduled co-operative banks , viz . , Apna Sahakari Bank Ltd . , Mumbai ; Vasai Vikas Sahakari Bank Ltd . , Thane ; Jalgaon Peoples Co-operative Bank Ltd . , Jalgaon ; Rajarambapu Sahakari Bank Ltd . , Peth , Sangli ; and Uttarakhand State Co-operative Bank Limited , Haldwani were included in the Second Schedule to the RBI Act , 1934 during the year .
Following the formation of the state of Telangana , the Telangana State Co- operative Apex Bank Ltd . , which commenced its Revival and Licensing of Unlicensed DCCBs With the rollout of a revival package by the central government for short-term co-operative credit institutions in 2006 ( based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Revival of Rural Co-operative Credit Institutions ( Chairman : Professor A. Vaidyanathan ) ) , and the revision in licensing norms by the Reserve Bank in 2009 , the number of unlicensed entities in the co-operative banking space has been on a decline .
While the number of unlicensed StCBs reduced from 17 to zero , the number of unlicensed DCCBs came down sharply from 296 to 23 by June 2013 .
In November 2014 , the central government announced another scheme for the revival of 23 unlicensed DCCBs in four states ( 16 in Uttar Pradesh , three each in Jammu and Kashmir and Maharashtra , and one in West Bengal ) .
Under the scheme , the estimated capital infusion for DCCBs was placed at 23.76 billion of which , 6.73 billion was to be contributed by the central government , % 14.65 billion by state governments and % 2.38 billion by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development ( NABARD ) .
Among the conditions outlined , the DCCBs have been asked to ( a ) reduce their NPA ratios by at least 50 per cent by March 31 , 2017 ; ( b ) achieve a growth of 15 per cent in their deposits in the following two years ; ( c ) prepare monthly monitorable action plans ; ( d ) ensure the appointment of competent CEOs fulfilling ' fit and proper ' criteria ; and ( e ) put in place appropriate corporate governance systems .
NABARD ' s contribution will be in the form of loans to respective state governments .
Subsequent to the release of funds by the central government , the state governments of Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh , and NABARD , licences were issued in 2015-16 to three DCCBs in Maharashtra and 11 DCCBs in Uttar Pradesh bringing down the number of unlicensed DCCBs to nine as on June 30 , 2016. mergers of UCBs were approved during the year and out of these , three were implemented .
VI.31 The on-going process of harmonisation of regulations for co-operative banks will be continued in 2016-17 .
Implementation of the revival scheme of the central government will be pursued with a view to ensuring that the DCCBs covered under the scheme are licensed .
Implementation of some recommendations of the HPC will be considered based on the feedback received from stakeholders .
Non-Banking Financial Companies ( NBFCs ) : Department of Non-Banking Regulation VI.32 NBFCs play a critical role in catering to under-served niche sectors .
An _ orderly development of NBFCs has been a priority for the Reserve Bank as shadow banking operations have a bearing on the stability of the financial system .
In 2015-16 , the focus of DNBR was to take forward the process of harmonisation of regulations across NBFCs and banks and move towards activity-based regulation .
Agenda for 2015-16 : Implementation Status Continued Harmonisation of Prudential Regulations VI.33 During the year , harmonisation of the following prudential regulations pertaining to NBFCs was undertaken : early recognition of financial distress ; prompt steps for resolution and fair recovery for lenders , including guidelines on the formation of JLF and corrective action plan ( CAP ) ; factoring activities by banks and those for NBFC-factors ; risk weights assigned to exposures to central / state government / s and _ claims guaranteed by state governments ; risk weights with respect to investments in corporate bonds by standalone primary dealers ; and strategic debt restructuring and refinancing of project loans .
NBFC-Account Aggregator and P2P Lending VI.34 Towards a consolidated view of financial assets , a new category of NBFC , viz . , NBFC- AA was proposed ( Box VI.4 ) .
In addition , a At present , financial asset holders such as holders of savings bank deposits , fixed deposits , mutual funds and insurance policies , get a scattered view of their financial asset holdings if the entities with whom these accounts are held fall under the purview of different financial sector regulators .
This gap will be filled by account aggregators who will provide information on various accounts held by a customer in a consolidated , organised and retrievable manner .
The option to avail the services of an account aggregator by a customer will be purely voluntary .
The draft directions governing NBFC-account aggregator ( AA ) were issued by the Reserve Bank in March 2016 .
Accordingly , the activities of NBFC-AA will be regulated by the Reserve Bank to ensure that the nature and terms of its services conform to prescribed standards .
As per these guidelines , the business of an account aggregator will be entirely driven by information technology ( IT ) .
The account aggregator will not support any transaction in financial assets by its customers .
The information will be shared by the account aggregator only with the customer to whom it relates or any other person authorised by the customer .
The account aggregator will be bound by the terms and conditions of the licence ( such as customer protection , grievance redressal , data security , audit control , corporate governance and risk management framework ) .
The account aggregator will have a Citizen Charter that explicitly guarantees the protection of the rights of customers .
Peer-to-peer ( P2P ) lending is an innovative form of crowd- funding with financial returns .
It involves the use of an online platform to bring lenders and borrowers together and help in mobilising unsecured finance .
The borrower can either be an individual or a business requiring a loan .
Accordingly , a fee is paid to the platform by both borrowers and lenders .
Interest rates range from a flat interest rate fixed by the platform to dynamic interest rates as agreed upon by borrowers and lenders using a cost-plus model ( operational costs plus margin for the platform and returns for lenders ) .
One of the main advantages of P2P lending for borrowers is that the rates are lower than those offered by money lenders / unorganised sector , while the lenders benefit from higher returns than those obtained from a savings account or from any other investment .
Although there has been significant growth in online lending platforms globally , there is no uniformity in the regulatory stance with regard to this sector across countries .
Simplification of the Registration Process VI.35 The process of issuing certificates of registration ( CoRs ) for NBFCs was _ simplified and rationalised .
Accordingly , the number of documents to be submitted for CoR were reduced from 45 to about eight .
Furthermore , NBFCs were divided into two categories for the purpose of CoR , viz . , Type | and Type Il .
It is argued that regulation may stifle the growth of this nascent sector .
On the other hand , proponents of regulation argue that the unregulated growth of this sector may breed unhealthy practices by market players and may , in the long- run , have systemic concerns given the susceptibility of this sector to attract high risk borrowers and also weaken the monetary policy transmission mechanism .
Hence , after multiple levels of review , the banks were advised to appropriately adjust the impairments in their books .
Accordingly , the Reserve Bank provided broad guidance on designing training programmes for internal skill enhancement , including the intended objectives , tentative coverage , methodology and resources for conceptualisation of these programmes .
The Reserve Bank also conducted three focused workshops covering nearly its entire staff associated with the RBS .
The workshops deployed case studies , quizzes and concept checker methods to achieve the desired skill transmission and assimilation .
VI.43 From the graded panels of ' experienced ' and ' new ' auditors received from the Comptroller and Auditor General of India , 126 audit firms were approved by the Reserve Bank for working as statutory central auditors in PSBs for 2015-16 .
VI.44 On direction from the Board for Financial Supervision ( BFS ) , the format for the biennial financial inspection of AIFls , viz , NABARD , Small Industries ' Development Bank of India ( SIDBI ) and National Housing Bank ( NHB ) was redesigned and snap audits based on this format were carried out to test and fine-tune it .
VI.48 The Reserve Bank has set up an Expert Panel on IT Examination and Cyber Security ( Chairperson : Smt .
VlI.49 During the supervisory cycle of 2016-17 , the remaining 26 banks will be brought under the SPARC framework , thus , bringing all SCBs ( excluding regional rural banks ( RRBs ) and LABs ) under the RBS .
VI.50 A back-office support system has been planned to facilitate a focused analysis of data to strengthen the supervision of individual banks .
This will also help in an analysis of data dumps obtained from banks in a systematic manner to bring out supervisory concerns , if any .
Supervisory returns , other than OSMOS returns , will be taken up for migration to the XBRL platform in Phase III of the XBRL project .
VlI.51 The Reserve Bank , in coordination with other domestic regulators , has _ initiated the process of finalising the criteria for identification of FCs in various market segments , viz . , banking , non-banking finance , insurance business , securities and pension funds .
All these colleges are scheduled to be conducted in 2016-17 as well .
Co-operative Banks : Department of Co- operative Bank Supervision ( DCBS ) VI.54 DCBS is entrusted with the primary responsibility of supervising primary ( urban ) co- operative banks ( UCBs ) as well as ensuring the development of a safe and well-managed co- operative banking sector .
Towards this objective , the Department undertakes supervision of UCBs through periodic on-site and continuous off-site monitoring .
Recent years have witnessed a significant growth of the NBFC sector as also the introduction of newer types of NBFCs imparting a critical role to this Department .
Agenda for 2015-16 : Implementation Status VI.58 For ensuring better coordination among various regulators and _ gathering market intelligence , a website , hosted by the Reserve Bank was operationalised during the year for use by state-level coordination committees ( chaired by the chief secretaries of state governments ) .
The Reserve Bank , through its proactive policy measures directly aimed at consumer protection along with its constant vigil of overall financial stability has rendered the financial system a safer place for consumers over the years .
Agenda for 2015-16 : Implementation Status Full-fledged Operationalisation of the Charter of VI.62 In 2014-15 , the Reserve Bank had issued the Charter of Customer Rights .
Towards expanding the reach of the offices of the Banking Ombudsman ( OBOs ) in rural and semi-urban areas as also for rationalising the jurisdiction of Banking Ombudsman Scheme - - A Review The BO scheme - a dispute redressal mechanism notified under Section 35 ( A ) of the Banking Regulation Act , 1949 - has been in existence since 1995 .
Since its inception , the scheme has been reviewed periodically ; the last being in 2009 .
The banking landscape has undergone significant transformation in recent years with the introduction of a large customer base following the adoption of financial inclusion plans as well as the PMJDY .
There has also been an increased penetration of technology-based products for financial inclusion during this period .
In 2015-16 , incognito visits to rural and semi-urban areas with regard to mis- selling of third party products by banks were carried out .
Similarly , a study on the functioning of ATMs was conducted during February-March 2016 .
The findings from this study are under examination to ascertain an appropriate supervisory response .
VI.65 With a view to strengthening the internal grievance redressal mechanism of banks as also ensuring limited escalation of complaints to the BO , the Reserve Bank advised all PSBs , select private banks and foreign banks to appoint chief customer service officers ( CCSO - internal ombudsman ) .
Accordingly , all concerned banks appointed CCSOs and operationalised their functioning during the year .
b . Compensation available under the present scheme for loss of time and money , mental anguish and harassment c . Inclusion of additional grounds for complaints under the d . Rationalisation of the clauses provided for rejection of complaints by the BO and inclusion of the clauses as appealable under the scheme ; and e . Rationalisation of Clause 11 of the scheme ( Settlement of Complaint by Agreement ) .
Banks will be shortly advised through IBA to implement the standardised forms .
VI.68 The Reserve Bank will monitor the implementation of the Charter of Customer Rights by banks , undertake full-fledged implementation of the amended BO scheme and work towards the operationalisation of new OBOs .
More forms commonly used by bank customers will be standardised across banks during the year .
Setting up of an appropriate ombudsman scheme for the NBFC sector is also on the agenda .
Need- based studies through incognito visits to bank branches on various customer service issues will be undertaken to assess the field-level situation .
Based on the assessment , an appropriate regulatory or supervisory response will be designed .
Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee VI.69 Deposit insurance is central to the framework for consumer protection in a financial system .
In India , DICGC - a _ wholly-owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank - insures depositors of all commercial banks , including LABs and RRBs , and co-operative banks .
With the present limit of deposit insurance of 0.1 million , the total number of fully protected accounts was 1,553 million as on March 31 , 2016 , which constituted 92.3 per cent of the total number of accounts ( 1,682 million ) as against the international benchmark of 80 per cent .
The amount of insured deposits was % 28,264 billion as at end-March 2016 , which worked out to 30 per cent of the assessable deposits ( of $ 94,053 billion ) well within the international benchmark of 20-30 per cent .
In 2015-16 , the claims settled by the Corporation amounted to % 0.47 billion as compared to ¥ 3.2 billion in the previous year .
In September 2015 , the Committee on Differential Premium System for Banks in India ( Chairman : Shri Jasbir Singh ) submitted its report .
In the light of the Committee ' s report , the modalities for a differential premium system based on risk profiles of banks are being worked out .
The key areas of focus in 2016-17 will be enhancing public awareness about deposit insurance and revamping the website of DICGC towards achieving this objective ; ensuring intensive co-operation with the International Association of Deposit Insurers ( IADI ) and making efforts to adhere to Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems .
This system will also enable the processing of claims by reducing manual intervention as well as online submission of deposit insurance returns .
NHB - the apex institution for housing finance - registers , regulates and supervises housing finance companies ( HFCs ) .
It also extends refinance to HFCs , SCBs and co-operative sector institutions against their housing loans , and project lending to borrowers in the public sector and public-private space .
Over the years , NHB ' s key concern has been to promote innovative market- based solutions for affordable housing finance to low income housing segments .
VI.75 NHB also extended refinance to HFCs at reduced rates under the Urban Housing Fund scheme to step up the flow of housing finance to flood-affected districts of Tamil Nadu .
As at end- June 2016 , ¥ 440 million was disbursed as part of this scheme .
Thus , efforts to ease the pressure on the current account deficit ( CAD ) from gold imports have to incorporate a plausible strategy to moderate demand for gold by providing a safe alternative .
Accordingly , three gold related schemes - the Gold Monetisation scheme , the Gold Coin Minted in India scheme and the Sovereign Gold Bond ( SGB ) scheme - were unveiled by the Government of India during 2015-16 .
The SGB scheme is managed by the Reserve Bank on behalf of the Government of India .
The net market borrowings of the central government , ( / .e. , through dated securities and T-bills ) declined to 4,530 billion in 2015-16 from 4,778 billion in 2014-15 ( Table VII.1 ) .
VIl.5 The weighted average yield of dated securities issued during the year declined to 7.89 per cent from 8.51 per cent in 2014-15 ( Chart VII.1 ) .
The tenor of the bond is for eight years , with the option of premature redemption after five years .
Approximately , 0.4 million retail investors were successfully allotted SGBs , both in physical and dematerialised forms through the Reserve Bank ' s e-Kuber ( CBS ) platform .
A further decline in yield was driven by ample liquidity , expectations on passage of the GST Constitutional Amendment Bill and increased FPI activity amid increased global uncertainties , post Brexit .
In order to manage the maturity profile and reduce rollover risks of the government debt in a proactive manner , buybacks and switches were conducted in the fourth quarter of 2015-16 for an amount of % 749 billion ( 579 billion in the previous year ) .
VIl.8 Reflecting the strategy of maturity elongation , the weighted average maturity of borrowings increased to 16.0 years in 2015-16 from 14.7 years in 2014-15 .
Consequently , the weighted average maturity of outstanding debt increased to 10.5 years in 2015-16 from 10.2 years in 2014-15 ( Table VII.2 ) .
@ Upto August 16 , 2016 .

However , the cost has marginally declined to 8.05 per cent during 2016-17 ( up to August 16 , 2016 ) .
VII.9 In view of limited space for issuance in maturities less than 10 years , about 66 per cent of the market borrowings were raised through issuance of dated securities with a _ residual maturity of 10 years and above in 2015-16 as compared to 60 per cent in 2014-15 , leading to a decline in the share of maturities less than 10 years by the end of the year ( Table VII.3 ) .
VIIl.10 Commercial banks remained the largest holders of dated securities , accounting for around 40 per cent as at end-June 2016 ( 43 per cent as at end-March 2015 ) followed by insurance companies and provident funds .
The share of the Reserve Bank ' s holdings increased to 14.9 per cent as on end-June 2016 as compared with 13.5 per cent as on end-March 2015 , mainly on account of net outright OMOs purchases .
Medium Term Debt Management Strategy Vil.11 A Medium Term Debt Management Strategy ( MTDS ) was formulated by the Reserve Bank in consultation with the Government and placed in the public domain on December 31 , 2015 .
Stress tests and scenario analyses in relation to costs , maturity and potential risks suggest that the Government of India ' s debt is stable and sustainable over the medium to long run .
Vil.12 T-Bills were issued essentially to smoothen the Government ' s temporary funding gaps .
The net issuance of T-bills was lower during 2015-16 than in the previous year .
Government ' s surplus cash balance with the Chart VII.2 : The Government of India ' s Cash Balance oars Heme gcanewMaAanpeeo ° 5 E20 y I - 2014-15 - 2015-16 - - 2016-17 Reserve Bank is being reckoned for auction at variable rate repos .
However , the Table VII.4 : Market Borrowings of States through SDLs Item 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 weighted average spread over the comparable central government securities increased to 50 bps from 38 bps during the previous year on concerns over increased supply due to UDAY bond issuances .
VII.16 An investors ' meet was conducted during the year to increase awareness on SDLs with the objective of diversifying the investor base among market participants .
The monthly average utilisation of WMA and OD by the states was higher during 2015-16 than that during 2014-15 .
Table VII.5 : Investments in ITBs and ATBs by Item Outstanding as on March 31 Aavisory Committee on WMA to State Vil.20 Pursuant to the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on WMA to state governments ( Chairman : Shri Sumit Bose ) which submitted its report in January 2016 , the WMA scheme for States was revisited .
Investments in Consolidated Sinking Fund ( CSF ) / Guarantee Redemption Fund ( GRF ) VIl.21 Outstanding investments in the CSF and the GRF maintained by state governments with the Reserve Bank stood at 781 billion and % 44 billion , respectively , as at end-March 2016 .
Total investments in CSF / GRF during the year aggregated to % 134 billion ( % 141 billion in 2014-15 ) .
VIl.22 The Union Budget 2016-17 projected gross market borrowings of % 6,000 billion through dated securities , higher by 2.6 per cent than the actual amount mobilised during the previous year .
The Reserve Bank will continue to make efforts towards market development , providing greater predictability and ease of access to the g-sec auction process by market participants .
Market borrowings of the state governments will be spread more evenly across the year along with a more robust quarterly calendar .
Reissuances of SDLs of different maturities will be continued to impart liquidity and better liability management operations .
The few remaining States which do not have CSF , will be encouraged to constitute it to strengthen their debt management operations .
The remaining issuances of special securities under the UDAY scheme _ will be completed with minimum market disruptions .
During 2015-16 , the demand for banknotes and coins remained high notwithstanding the growing slift towards non-cash modes of transactions .
Atend-March 2016 , the value of banknotes in circulation was % 16,415 billion showing an increase of 14.9 per cent as against 11.4 per cent in 2014-15 .
The volume of banknotes increased by 8.0 per cent as against 8.1 per cent in 2014- 15 .
VIll.2 The total value of coins in circulation increased by 12.4 per cent in 2015-16 as against 12.1 per cent last year ; in volume terms , the increase was 8.2 per cent which is marginally higher than that in the previous year ( 8.0 per cent in 2014-15 ) .
VIII.8 CMA comprises 19 issue offices , 4,075 currency chests ( including sub-treasury offices and a currency chest of the Reserve Bank in Kochi ) and 3,746 small coin depots at commercial , cooperative and regional rural banks , across India ( Table VIII.3 ) .
VIIL.4 To strengthen the distribution of currency by leveraging technology , the Reserve Bank is considering a hub and spoke model of mega- currency chests ( MCCs ) , which will meet the currency needs of a designated area ( as a district ) .
Agenda for 2015-16 : Implementation Status ViIL13 A billion pieces of banknotes in denomination of ¥ 10 were to be printed on all available plastic substrates and issued to the public in five cities having different climatic zones , viz . , Kochi , Mysuru , Shimla , Jaipur and Bhubaneswar , on a field trial basis .
The Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Private Limited ( BRBNMPL ) and the Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Limited ( SPMCIL ) have taken up this project .
VIll.14 The scheme of incentives and penalties for bank branches including currency chests was introduced in 2008 and expanded in 2014-15 by the Reserve Bank so as to enable bank branches to provide efficient and effective customer service to members of the public for supply and exchange of notes and coins .
Vill.15 Central banks worldwide adopt a standardised practice of periodic up-gradation of security features of banknotes to stay ahead of counterfeiters .
While in India , the last such up-gradation was done in 2005 with a new 2005 series of banknotes , certain new features such as bleed lines and exploding numbers were introduced during 2015-16 ( Box VIII.1 ) .
Furthermore , the Government of India approved have also been introduced in banknotes of denominations of marks in % 100 , ¥ 500 and % 1,000 denomination notes ( circle , triangle , diamond ) has been increased by 50 per cent for easy identification .
Angular bleed lines have been introduced : 4 lines in 2 blocks in % 100 , 5 lines in 3 blocks in % 500 and 6 lines in 4 blocks in % 1,000 denominations .
The design of banknotes of ¥ 100 , $ 500 and 1000 denomination is similar in all other respects to the current design of banknotes of the Mahatma Gandhi Series 2005 .
The legal tender status of all the banknotes of these denominations issued earlier which do not contain these features will remain unchanged .
The process of procurement of new security features is presently underway while banknotes with new designs are also proposed to be introduced .
VIll.16 BRBNMPL is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank which runs two banknote printing presses in Mysuru and Salboni .
It is proposed to set up an ink manufacturing unit within BRBNMPL as part of efforts towards the ' Make in India ' programme .
Further , the Reserve Bank focused on enhancements in the IT infrastructure for internal users and bringing about improved efficiency and coverage for government transactions .
The department continued its focus on migrating to a ' less-cash ' society through a process of stakeholder consultation for developing a regulatory framework that is responsive to emerging developments and innovations .
Among other things , enhancement of infrastructure with multiple channels and products for payment services has widened the customer base .
Trend and Progress in Payment Systems IX.2 Overall , the payment and _ settlement systems registered robust growth during 2015-16 , with volumes and value growing at 49.5 per cent and 9.1 per cent , respectively .
In volume terms , the share of electronic transactions in total transactions moved up to 84.4 per cent from 74.6 per cent in the previous year .
In value terms , their share moved up to 95.2 per cent from 94.6 per cent .
IX.3 Atend-March 2016 , the national electronic funds transfer ( NEFT ) facility was available through 130,013 branches of 172 banks , in addition to business correspondent ( BC ) outlets .
NEFT handled 1.2 billion transactions valued at around % 83 trillion , up from 928 million transactions for % 60 trillion in the previous year .
In March 2016 , NEFT processed the largest ever monthly volume of 129 million transactions .
IX.4 During 2015-16 , 786 million transactions valued at around % 2.4 trillion were carried out through credit cards , while 1.2 billion transactions valued at 1.6 trillion were carried out through debit cards .
Prepaid payment instruments ( PPIs ) recorded 748 million transactions valued at ¥ 488 billion as compared to 314 million transactions valued at ¥ 212 billion in the previous year .
Mobile banking service growth surged by 126.6 per cent in terms of volume and 290.3 per cent in terms of value handling 389 million transactions valued at % 4 trillion during the year .
Authorisation of Payment Systems IX.5 | The number of authorised payment system operators stood at 71 comprising PPI issuers , cross-border money transfer service providers , white label ATM ( WLA ) operators , ATM networks , instant money transfer service providers and card payment networks besides the Clearing Corporation of India Limited ( CCIL ) and the Table IX.1 : Payment System Indicators - Annual Turnover Item Volume ( million ) Value ( ® billion ) 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 Systemically Important Financial Market Note : 1 .
On the production side , agriculture and allied activities rebounded sharply in 2016-17 .
Record foodgrains and horticulture production , facilitated by the normal monsoon as well as considerable hike in pulses ' Minimum Support Prices ( MSPs ) , augmented the sector ' s growth during the year .
On the other hand , deceleration in services Gross Value Added ( GVA ) across all sub-sectors barring public administration , defence and other services ( PADO ) , moderated the overall GVA growth .
The slowdown was pronounced in H2 as construction and real estate sectors , which relied to a large extent on cash transactions , were severely impacted following demonetisation .
The growth in industrial GVA also decelerated from a year ago , dragged down by a slowdown in manufacturing and mining , even though electricity generation accelerated .
On the use-based front , consumer non-durables posted the highest growth across sectors while consumer durables decelerated significantly .
Industrial output seemed to have been impacted , albeit transiently , by demonetisation as IIP growth during November 2016 to March 2017 was 2.6 percentage points lower than in the pre-demonetisation period ( April - October 2016 ) .
As the infrastructure sector is widely perceived to hold the key to revival of growth , top priority was accorded to addressing environmental clearances , land acquisition issues and other structural bottlenecks associated with project implementation , which led to a reduction in the number of stalled projects and cost overruns in central sector infrastructure projects during 2016- 17 .
During the year , there was the highest ever awarding and construction of national highway projects .
The resolution of stalled projects , development of roads under Bharat Mala project , steps taken to streamline land acquisition , inter alia , helped to speed up road construction .
Capacity addition in major ports was also the highest ever in a single year with improvement in total turn-around time and average output per ship berth day .
In respect of the power sector , the shortfall in meeting total energy requirements bottomed out during the year .
In addition , India turned around from a net importer to a net exporter of electricity for the first time .
Concomitant to the impetus for cleaner energy , the renewable energy sector surpassed thermal power in annual capacity addition , also for the first time .
This apart , increased capacity addition in solar energy and enhanced private sector interest , coupled with the availability of cheaper voltaic cells , resulted in historically low solar tariffs in recent reverse auctions .
Moreover , almost all state governments joined the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana ( UDAY ) scheme during the year , strengthening prospects for financial turnaround of distribution companies ( DISCOMs ) on a macro scale , going forward .
It was 3.43 days on an average in 2016-17 as against 3.64 days during the previous year .
It was 14,576 tonnes in 2016-17 as against 13,748 tonnes during the previous year .
Rapid disinflation in the food group drove down headline inflation month after month - barring February and March - to a low of 1.5 per cent in June 2017 .
Eventually , the year 2016-17 ended up with a subdued inflation of 3.6 per cent in Q4 , undershooting the Bank ' s projection of 5.0 per cent .
The asset quality of the banking sector continued to be a concern during 2016-17 .
In the aftermath of the asset quality review ( AQR ) undertaken by the Reserve Bank beginning July 2015 and concomitantly with better recognition of non-performing assets ( NPAs ) , the asset quality of banks , particularly the PSBs ,
A sharp increase in provisioning for NPAs adversely impacted the profitability of banks , with the PSBs as a whole continuing to incur net losses during 2016-17 .
The capital position of many banks also witnessed erosion even though the capital to risk-weighted assets ratio ( CRAR ) for the banking system as a whole marginally increased and continued to be above the regulatory minimum under the Basel Ill framework .
The large amount of bad loans circumscribed the ability of banks to lend , as reflected in the declining credit growth in recent years .
Furthermore , banks engaged in diversifying their credit portfolios , reducing their exposure from large industries and shifting towards the relatively less stressed categories of housing , personal loans and services .
Predominantly driven down by the compression in currency in circulation , reserve money contracted during the year while the growth of money supply moderated , despite the surge in deposits .
Besides demonetisation , intra-year spikes in deposits growth were caused by mobilisation under the Income Declaration Scheme ( IDS ) and arrears of the 7 CPC to central government employees .
The surge in deposits led to excess liquidity in the banking system which was absorbed through an array of liquidity management measures , viz . , reverse repo under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility ( LAF ) , incremental Cash Reserve Ratio ( CRR ) , and issuance of Cash Management Bills ( CMBs ) under the Market Stabilisation Scheme ( MSS ) .
Credit growth touched a low in more than two decades on account of factors such as subdued state of economic activity , risk aversion of the banking sector , capital adequacy requirements , loan write-offs , substitution of bank credit by UDAY bonds , loan repayment by use of specified bank notes ( SBNs ) and banks ' pre-occupation with exchange of notes and deposits following demonetisation .
As the pace of remonetisation gathered momentum , monetary aggregates started recovering with currency in circulation as of end-June 2017 reaching around 85 per cent of its pre-demonetisation peak .
The institutional architecture forthe conduct of monetary policy underwent a fundamental shift , with the formal transition to a flexible inflation targeting framework and the constitution of a six member monetary policy committee ( MPC ) for setting the policy rate .
These reforms marked the culmination of efforts made since early 2014 to strengthen the transparency , credibility and independence of monetary policy formulation .
The conduct of monetary policy during 2016- 17 was guided by an inflation objective of 5.0 per cent for Q4 of 2016-17 .
With inflation , then expected to be below its objective for Q4 : 2016- 17 , the MPC in its resolution of February 8 , 2017 emphasised its commitment to the medium-term inflation target of 4 per cent within a band of + / - 2 per cent while supporting growth .
Keeping this in view , the stance of monetary policy was changed from accommodative to neutral in February 2017 .
The inflation objective for Q4 : 2016-17 was met with a considerable undershoot on the back of strong disinflation in food items , driven partly by demonetisation .
Postdemonetisation , the pace of monetary transmission from the policy repo rate to banks ' lending rates accelerated significantly , aided by the increase in the share of low cost current account and saving account ( CASA ) deposits in bank funding .
However , the transmission to actual lending rates was uneven across sectors , reflecting sector-specific credit risk dynamics .
Also , the transmission of past cumulative cuts in the repo rate to lending rates has not propelled a revival in credit growth as banks , especially PSBs , appeared to have turned risk-averse and strapped by large provisioning requirements , as mentioned earlier .
As such , private investment activity remained depressed .
The recent experience suggests that monetary easing alone may not help in reviving the investment sentiment unless structural factors affecting it are addressed .
Notwithstanding a deferment of the target of 3.0 per cent gross fiscal deficit to gross domestic product ( GFD / GDP ) ratio to 2018-19 as announced in the Union Budget 2017-18 , adherence of the central government to the fiscal consolidation path in 2016-17 enhanced fiscal credibility , thereby anchoring inflation expectations in the economy .
Fiscal consolidation was achieved during 2016-17 through a strategy of revenue augmentation rather than expenditure compression , exemplifying improvement in the quality of public finances .
Tax revenues were shored up by collections under the IDS , upward revision or imposition of cess , additional excise duty and pruning of the negative list for services tax .
Capital expenditure exceeded the budget estimates even as revenue expenditure was broadly contained within the budgeted level .
Consequently , the gross fiscal deficit remained at the budgeted level of 3.5 per cent .
In contrast , state finances deteriorated on account of UDAY scheme and revenue shortfalls despite cutbacks in capital outlays .
During 2016-17 , the benchmark Indian equity indices , viz . , BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 increased by 16.9 per cent and 18.5 per cent , respectively , as against some contraction in the previous year .
The stock market gained on account of optimism over the Union Budget proposals , passage of the GST Bill , favourable monsoon , expectations of steady progress of economic reforms , better macroeconomic data , higher than expected Q3 earnings of companies and huge buying by institutional investors amid positive cues from global equity markets .
The Indian equity market had eased temporarily in Q3 owing to several factors such as the US Presidential election outcome , increasing expectations of interest rate hike by the US Fed , withdrawal of legal tender status of SBNs , and foreign portfolio investment ( FPI ) selling , but recovered in the next quarter .
India ' s external sector strengthened during 2016-17 as reflected in a lower current account deficit ( CAD ) , robust FDI inflows , build- up of forex reserves and improvement in other external vulnerability indicators .
The trade deficit narrowed with stronger exports and subdued imports and offset the impact of lower net receipts from services exports and remittances , and higher outgo of investment income payments .
Net capital flows were in excess of CAD , resulting in an increase in foreign exchange reserves during the year .
Following the redemption of FCNR ( B ) deposits by banks without much disruption in the foreign exchange market , India ' s external debt turned much lower than its level a year ago .
The reduction in the CAD and external debt , and build-up of foreign exchange buffers , fortified the resilience of the external sector in 2016-17 .
Global growth is gaining traction in 2017-18 with the recovery , driven primarily by a cyclical upturn in investment , manufacturing and trade .
Tailwinds are also expected from the improving performance of emerging markets and developing economies ( EMDEs ) .
However , the path and pace of global growth will likely be shaped by structural factors , viz . , the inward- looking protectionist policies in advanced economies , low productivity growth and high income inequality impinging on the cyclical upturn .
Amid elevated asset prices , financial markets remain vulnerable to systemic factors , including geo-political risks and the pace of normalisation of monetary policy and balance sheets by major central banks .
Consequently , external risks to the domestic economy remain .
Against the backdrop of these external developments , strengthening external demand will likely play a role in supporting the domestic economy .
Favourable domestic conditions are mainly expected to enable a quicker pace of overall economic activity during the year .
While growth is again expected to be consumption-led , continuing remonetisation should enable a pick- up in discretionary consumer spending , especially in cash-intensive segments of the economy .
Government spending continues to be robust , cushioning the impact of a slowdown in other constituents .
Furthermore , reductions in bank lending rates post-demonetisation should support investment demand of stress-free corporates .
On the downside , global political risks remain elevated .
Second , rising input costs may prove a drag on the profitability of firms , pulling down the overall GVA growth .
Third , the twin balance sheet problem - over-leveraged corporate sector and stressed banking sector - may delay the revival in private investment demand .
The expected normal monsoon and the resultant replenishment of reservoirs , policy initiatives of the government such as hike in MSPs and increasing crop insurance coverage are likely to help in boosting crop production and supporting rural demand .
The implementation of HRA as per the recommendation of the 7 CPC for central government employees from July 2017 and the possibility of its implementation at the state level should strengthen urban consumption demand .
An offsetting impact on aggregate demand could , however , emerge if state governments restrain or scale down capital spending , keeping in view the objective of fiscal consolidation .
Early indicators for 2017-18 based on IIP and the performance of eight core industries point to subdued industrial activity .
The prospects for the manufacturing sector remain uncertain in the short term in view of the implementation of GST .
The services sector is , however , expected to perform better during the year .
The majority of the high frequency services sector indicators , shows signs of improvement thus far , though some sectors such as commercial vehicles have been adversely affected by external factors like emission norms .
Construction and real estate seem to be on the path of recovery as reflected in rebounding of new residential project launches to pre-demonetisation levels .
Furthermore , government initiatives such as infrastructure status for affordable housing , improved customer protection and transparency through the real estate regulatory agencies , modified policy norms on real estate investment trusts to address funding issues , and the provision for 75 per cent upfront payment of the arbitral amount by Public Sector Undertakings ( PSUs ) to builders and contractors , should provide a boost to the housing sector .
On the whole , real GVA growth is projected to rise from 6.6 per cent in 2016-17 to 7.3 per cent in 2017-18 , with risks evenly balanced .
Headline inflation remained around 2.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2017-18 .
In June 2017 , inflation declined to a historic low of 1.5 per cent , primarily driven by disinflation in food and large favourable base effects .
Excluding food and fuel , inflation eased on account of subdued price pressures in services , particularly transport and communication , reflecting fall in global crude oil prices .
With the likely progress of the south- west monsoon , food prices are likely to remain moderate over the ensuing months , consequent upon the dissipation of seasonal price pressures of select vegetables such as tomatoes .
Furthermore , in view of the bumper production and record procurement of pulses during 2016-17 , inflation in pulses - a major driver of food inflation during 2015-16 and early 2016-17 - is expected to remain muted .
Notwithstanding these developments , some uptick in overall food inflation could be expected as unfavourable base effects set in from August 2017 .
In contrast , the implementation of the GST is not expected to have a material impact on headline inflation in the near term .
However , the announcements of farm loan waivers and the implementation of the 7 CPC with the likelihood of adoption at the state level have implications in terms of fiscal slippages with upside pressures to the future trajectory of headline inflation .
On the whole , headline inflation is forecast in the range of 2.0-3.5 per cent in the first half of 2017-18 and 3.5-4.5 per cent in the second half .
The continuing increase in currency in circulation on the back of remonetisation is likely to reduce the magnitude of the liquidity overhang during the course of the year .
In this scenario , the Reserve Bank will continue to manage liquidity to ensure that the operating target - weighted average call money rate ( WACR ) - remains aligned to the policy repo rate .
Continuing government initiative towards a full implementation of the formula for adjustment in the interest rates on small savings schemes to changes in yields on government securities of corresponding maturities will further strengthen the transmission of policy rates to bank lending rates , which will help increase credit demand .
Notwithstanding the rapid remonetisation process , currency demand appears to have attained a new normal ( currently around 87 per cent of the pre-demonetisation peak ) in view of the sharp increase in electronic modes of payments since demonetisation .
Indeed , year- on-year growth rates of the total volume of retail electronic payments , that had averaged around 37 per cent during April to October 2016 , shot up to nearly 70 per cent in November and then further to as much as 123 per cent in December 2016 ; in subsequent months , the growth rates have moderated but remain high .
There appears to be a structural break in the volume and value of retail electronic payments , coinciding with the onset of demonetisation and the special measures put in place to promote digital payments .
Going forward , the Reserve Bank would continue its efforts towards migrating to a less-cash economy while ensuring safety and enhancing the efficiency of the payments system .
In the fiscal sphere , while the gains to growth , efficiency and tax buoyancy over the medium term from the recent implementation of GST are unequivocally recognised , near-term uncertainties with regard to revenue mobilisation therefrom - which could impact fiscal consolidation at both centre and state levels - cannot be ruled out as this fundamental reform gains pan-India traction .
Additionally , state government finances are likely to face several challenges during 2017- 18 .
First , the announcement of farm loan waivers by four state governments ( so far in 2017-18 ) and the potential announcement by several others pose a major fiscal risk over the medium term .
Besides impacting credit discipline , vitiating credit culture and dis-incentivising borrowers from repayment , they may have a destabilising impact on yields of state development loans ( SDL ) , thereby posing a higher interest burden for the states in future .
Concomitantly , ratchet effects can firm up the general level of interest rates and crowd out private borrowers .
Second , the committed liabilities of states may increase in case they decide to implement the recommendations of their own pay commissions in 2017-18 .
Third , the existing high level of state government guarantees constitutes a major fiscal risk .
Fourth , the interest liabilities of states that have participated in financial restructuring of DISCOMs ( through UDAY ) would increase in the years ahead .
Fifth , many states ( particularly the fiscally prudent ones ) , which were earlier refraining from seeking additional funds through market borrowing , may now borrow as per the flexibility provided by the Fourteenth Finance Commission .
Thus , even as the central government makes _ significant efforts toward _ fiscal consolidation , the higher debt burden of the states could push up general government debt .
In the external sector , a slump in export growth and an increase in imports widened the trade deficit to US $ 40 billion in Q1 of 2017-18 , the highest since Q2 of 2013-14 .
The evolution of terms of trade is likely to be largely shaped by the outlook for oil production in the US and compliance with the extended production cuts announced by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) .
Even though the outlook among major trade partner economies entails a modest expansion , increasing recourse to protectionist measures in advanced economies could impose a challenging business environment for exports .
The global economic environment is prone to other downside risks such as high policy uncertainty in advanced economies and the possibility of financial market disruptions due to faster normalisation of monetary policy by advanced economies .
Nevertheless , the CAD is expected to be comfortably financed by stable capital inflows as FDI may remain strong with further progress in the ease of doing business and simplification of procedures in recent years .
Foreign portfolio flows , on the other hand , remain vulnerable to bouts of global risk aversion .
However , an optimistic growth outlook , pro-reform measures and augmented level of reserves are expected to mitigate the negative spillovers of global market disruptions .
In the banking arena , the actions of the central government authorising the Reserve Bank to direct banking companies to resolve specific stressed assets by initiating insolvency resolution process are expected to significantly improve the resolution of stressed assets , particularly in consortium or multiple banking arrangements .
The corporate insolvency resolution process , liquidation and cross-border insolvency under the IBC , 2016 and the establishment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India ( IBBI ) will help in reorganisation and resolution of corporates and individuals in a time-bound manner .
The proposal of the Union Budget 2017-18 to introduce a bill relating to resolution of financial firms is expected to improve the resilience and stability of the financial system through speedy and efficient resolution of financial firms in distress , and also help address the moral hazard problem associated with explicit and implicit government guarantees .
The prescription of stringent penalties by the Reserve Bank for breaching the risk thresholds under the revised Prompt Corrective Action ( PCA ) framework - restrictions on dividend payments , remittance of profits and branch expansion ; higher provisions ; and restriction on management compensation are expected to help restore the health of banks currently under PCA .
The Reserve Bank ' s instructions to banks to put in place a Board-approved policy for making provisions for standard assets at rates higher than the regulatory minimum , based on evaluation of risk and stress in various sectors , will help control build-up of fresh stressed assets in a pre-emptive manner .
The fine-tuning of macro-prudential measures in the form of reduction in risk weights and provisioning on standard assets on certain categories of individual housing loans will provide a boost to the flow of credit to the housing sector .
In pursuance of the regulatory stance in 2016-17 , the Reserve Bank will continue to monitor and respond to banks asset quality issues in 2017- 18 as well .
Implementation of Indian Accounting Standard ( Ind-AS ) and the Basel III framework will remain the areas of focus during 2017-18 .
The revised framework for securitisation , the minimum capital requirement for market risk , guidelines on net stable funding ratio ( NSFR ) and the guidelines on corporate governance as per Basel standards will be considered during the course of the year .
The banking sector has undergone significant transformation by digital innovations in the past few years and the Reserve Bank will work on framing an appropriate response to the regulatory challenges posed by developments in FinTech .
Taking note of changes in the global and financial sector environment , the Reserve Bank formalised a framework for taking enforcement action against banks for non-compliance with guidelines and instructions issued by it .
Accordingly , a separate Enforcement Department has been created within the Reserve Bank in April 2017 .
Going forward , an important initiative under active consideration of the Reserve Bank is the setting up of a transparent and comprehensive public credit register ( PCR ) - an extensive database of credit information for India that is accessible to all stakeholders - that would help in enhancing efficiency of the credit market , increase financial inclusion , improve ease of doing business , and help control delinquencies , as corroborated by international evidence .
In this regard , a High-level Task Force comprising experts as well as major stakeholders is being constituted to , inter alia , review the current availability of information on credit in India and suggest a roadmap , including priority areas , for developing a transparent , comprehensive and near-real-time PCR for India .
Infrastructural development of the economy would continue to play a critical role in shaping growth prospects , particularly over the medium to long run .
The recent policy measures for easing of norms for state PSUs to directly borrow from bilateral agencies , launching of Infrastructure Investment Trust and _ full-fledged rolling out of National Investment and Infrastructure Fund are also expected to address the infrastructure financing constraints significantly .
In the power sector , higher capacity addition in renewables may pose multiple challenges with regard to the integration of renewables into the electricity grid and the possible dampening effect on already worsened thermal Plant Load Factor ( PLF ) .
However , the new coal linkage policy and the impetus for more nuclear power plants would engender a positive outlook for the sector .
Finally , in the area of employment generation , spending on priority sectors ( roads , railways , health and housing ) , MGNREGA ( i.e. , Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act ) and the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Loan Scheme are going to be the most important factors .
As labour regulations get further simplified , more jobs are expected to be included and created in the formal sector .
On labour reforms , the codification of labour laws into four codes , viz . , wages , industrial relations , social security and welfare , and safety and working conditions , will help avoid multiplicity of labour laws .
At the same time , the job loss threat , particularly in Information Technology and Information Technology Enabled Services ( IT and ITES ) sector emanating from the emerging global protectionism cannot be overlooked .
As a consequence , gross fixed capital formation ( GFCF ) contributed barely 0.7 percentage point to the real GDP growth of 7.1 per cent in 2016-17 despite accounting for around one-third of real GDP .
Net exports contributed 0.4 percentage point , helped by a turnaround in merchandise export performance after contraction in the previous year .
The rest of the real GDP growth was consumption-driven - both private and public .
In fact , absent the implementation of the 7 Central Pay Commission and one-rank-one-pension ( OROP ) for defence services embedded in government consumption , real GDP growth would have been lower by 2 percentage points .
Private consumption spending alone contributed two-thirds of the growth of aggregate demand .
In this context , Box II.1 addresses issues around the sustainability of consumption-led growth and its unintended consequences .
The slackening of aggregate demand set in from the first quarter of the year .
This is confirmed by the loss of momentum showing up in three-quarter moving averages of seasonally adjusted annualised growth rates ( MA-SAARs ) .
Underlying the loss of momentum , GFCF began to lose height from Q2 and sank into contraction in Q4 of 2016-17 .
This development is worrisome in view of the secular-like retreat of the rate of gross domestic investment in the 2011-12 based GDP series [ incorporating the new indices of industrial production ( IIP ) and wholesale prices ( WPI ) ] to 29.5 per cent of GDP in 2016-17 .
While the falling away of fixed investment mainly occurred in household dwellings , other buildings and structures .
Fixed investment by other agents - government and private non- financial corporations - increased , but marginally , to provide an offset .
The Reserve Bank ' s survey of order books , inventories and capacity utilisation indicated persisting slack in capacity utilisation ( seasonally adjusted ) in manufacturing in 2016- 17 .
New investment intentions contracted in 2016-17 with respect to both government and private sectors , with the cost of private projects remaining elevated .
Plant load factors in thermal power plants underwent a sustained decline , largely reflecting weakness in demand from financially stressed distribution companies .
The resilience of some _ infrastructure sectors in the face of this downturn is noteworthy and brightens the outlook .
First , there was a decline in cost and time overruns in central sector infrastructure projects ( ₹ 1.5 billion and above ) .
Second , awarding and construction of highway projects in the road sector reached an all-time high even as daily additions to the roads constructed touched a peak of 22.6 km during 2016-17 from 16.6 km last year .
Third , stalled projects declined by 40 per cent in terms of value and 37 per cent in terms of number .
Fourth , capacity addition in major ports was the highest ever in a single year and 12 major ports recorded higher growth in cargo traffic as well as efficiency gains measured in turnaround time ( 3.43 days in 2016- 17 as against 3.64 days in the previous year ) , and average output per ship berth day ( 14,576 tonnes in 2016-17 as against 13,748 tonnes in the previous year ) .
In the power sector , 27 states / UTs joined the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana ( UDAY ) to deleverage and revive distribution companies , and issued bonds worth ₹ 2.32 trillion ( 86.3 per cent of the target of ₹ 2.69 trillion ) .
In the civil aviation sector , a Regional Connectivity Scheme ( RCS ) was launched in October 2016 .
In the automobile sector , the government provided incentives for demand and manufacture of electric / hybrid vehicles .
In matters of government procurements , a new policy decision has been taken in favour of domestically manufactured goods .
Consumption expenditure set a _ floor to the slowdown in real GDP growth in 2016- 17 and actually accelerated in the second half of the year when the impact of demonetisation was the most intense .
This proved fortuitous as it coincided with the deepening retrenchment in fixed investment .
Government final consumption , boosted by revisions in salaries and pensions referred to earlier , provided nearly a third of this support .
Private consumption expenditure also benefited from rising real incomes - from the sharp fall in inflation and crowding-in income effects of government spending - and raised its contribution to real GDP growth from 57 per cent in H1 of 2016-17 to about 79 per cent in H2 .
The strength of private consumption was reflected in the acceleration of agricultural GVA as well as the sizable increase in telephone connections , indirect tax collections and the index of manufacturing constituting a part of industrial production .
Consumption as a driver of growth has been associated with low growth multipliers and ' half- life ' , with some evidence that side effects such as rising household indebtedness could turn out to be growth-retarding in the medium-term .
Is Consumption-Led Expansion Sustainable ?
A Case Study of India In recent years , GDP growth in India has been consumption- led , more so during 2013-14 and 2016-17 .
In such a phase of growth , consumption grows faster than GDP , either in nominal or real terms , so that the consumption- to-GDP ratio increases over time or alternatively , real consumption growth exceeds real GDP growth ( Kharroubi and Kohlscheen 2017 ) .
At a high growth level ( above 8 per cent ) , the growth process was observed to be non-consumption-led .
Given that India has a large domestic consumer market , consumption may be the inevitable means of economic growth .
However , whether consumption-led growth is beneficial for economic growth or acts as a drag remains to be assessed , particularly in view of the fact that rates of growth in investment and net exports have not been very impressive in recent years .
Growth in private ( corporate plus household ) credit to GDP ratio and growth in combined debt service ratio ?
The impact of the debt service ratio was significant neither numerically ( -0.1 percentage point ) nor statistically , indicating the muted role of formal finance in driving consumption growth .
Consumption-led growth did have , albeit not statistically significant , a negative impact on consumption growth one- year ahead .
These results corroborate the imperative for a judicious balance in the growth drivers for non-disruptive and sustainable long-term growth .
On the investment front , households ' physical assets declined sharply to 10.7 per cent in 2015-16 , contributing to the overall decline in fixed capital formation .
As per preliminary estimates , household financial savings rate increased further to 8.1 per cent of GNDI in 2016-17 on account of an increase in households ' assets in bank ' In case consumption-led growth is defined in terms of weighted contribution to overall growth , almost all such episodes in India could be characterised as consumption-led , given the large share of private consumption in GDP .
Debt service ratio is calculated by applying weighted average lending rate to outstanding credit and then dividing by GDP .
Higher financial savings were mainly supported by lower inflationary scenario as also portfolio adjustment from physical to financial assets by households .
At the same time , there was an increase in financial liabilities of the household sector .
The quarterly pattern of GVA growth tracked that of the services sector in which , too , the deceleration was stark in H2 and co-moving in all constituents , barring PADO .
Although not as well synchronised , the evolution of the GVA of industry also dragged during H2 , essentially in manufacturing .
This strong revival occurred on the back of normal precipitation [ 97 per cent of the Long Period Average ( LPA ) ] in the south-west monsoon ( SWM ) .
The initial delay in the monsoon ' s onset was more than compensated by recovery in July-August 2016 and a belated departure .
This helped maintain soil moisture and replenished reservoirs .
Consequently , even though the north- east monsoon ( NEM ) ended at 45 per cent below LPA , the reservoir position remained above the 10-year average .
At the end of December 2016 , the water level in 91 major reservoirs across the country stood at 126 per cent of the live storage a year ago .
Rabi sowing turned out to be higher by 5.7 per cent than in the previous year , aided by higher MSPs ( especially for pulses ) and availability of key agricultural inputs .
The fourth advance estimates of crops for 2016-17 have placed the production of foodgrains at 275.7 million tonnes , which is 9.6 per cent higher than in the previous year and a historical record .
Besides favourable agro- climatic conditions , multi-pronged initiatives such as incentives for crop diversification , issuance of soil health cards , focus on integrated irrigation schemes , a simplified crop insurance scheme and improved marketing facilities created an enabling environment .
The record production spurred an extensive drive to procure rice and wheat to replenish depleted stocks .
The all-time high production of pulses at 22.95 million tonnes , combined with a surge in imports of as much as 6.6 million tonnes , facilitated the build-up of buffer stock during the year ( Box II.2 ) .
Source : Food Corporation of India and Ministry of Consumer Affairs , Food and Public Distribution , Gol .
2017-18 , the Ministry of Agriculture set higher targets of production for foodgrains ( both cereals and pulses ) as well as commercial crops ( sugarcane , oilseeds and cotton ) .
Region-wise , the distribution of rainfall during 2017-18 so far has , however , been somewhat uneven , with the east and north-east region receiving rainfall above LPA while the south peninsula ( particularly Kerala and Karnataka ) and the central India ( particularly Madhya Pradesh ) experiencing deficiency ( Chart II.7 ) .
The deceleration in the growth of GVA in industry in 2016-17 in relation to the preceding year is not reflected in the new series of IIP .
The CSO released a new series on the IIP in mid-May 2017 , changing ( a ) the constituent items to better represent the evolving industrial structure ; and ( b ) the base year to 2011-12 from 2004-05 , thereby aligning it with national accounts and the new In India , which is the largest producer , consumer and importer of pulses - a major plant source of protein - domestic demand follows the celebrated Bennett ' s Law .
Low and near stagnant productivity , and excessive reliance on the monsoon are widely identified as the biggest impediments to augmenting domestic output ( Chart 1.a & b ) .
As a fallout , 15-20 per cent of the domestic requirement of pulses was made up by imports through the last 15 years ( Chart 1.b ) .
Prices of pulses follow a cycle .
Years of bumper production are preceded by monsoon failure , high pulses inflation , and their imports .
Subsequently , farmers are incentivised by remunerative global and / or domestic prices coupled with higher than usual hikes in MSPs to bring in more areas under cultivation .
The wedge between industrial GVA and IIP mainly reflects the impact of falling input costs .
The new IIP has expanded the coverage of manufacturing sector from 620 items in 397 groups to 809 items in 405 groups .
With the increase in item groups reporting in value terms from 53 to 109 ( mostly in the capital goods category ) , capital goods now include ' work-in-progress ' and thus account for longer production cycles and minimise the volatility resulting from bulk reporting on delivery .
Other major changes in the manufacturing index include higher weightage to petroleum products ( from 6.7 per cent to 11.8 per cent ) to account for subsidies and inclusion of a new sub-group " Manufacture of pharmaceuticals , medicinal chemical and botanical products . "
Electricity index now captures electricity generation out of renewable sources while the number of minerals have been reduced from 62 to 29 in the mining index , taking into account the reclassification done by the Mineral Conservation and Development Rules , 2016 .
A new use-based category , ' infrastructure / construction goods ' has been introduced while ' basic goods ' have been re-christened as ' primary goods ' .
The weights of primary goods and consumer non-durables have declined on transfer of items to the infrastructure / construction category .
The weight of manufacturing has increased while that of electricity has reduced in the overall index .
In 2016-17 , IIP increased by 4.4 per cent as against a contraction of 0.1 per cent under the old index .
Structural bottlenecks became manifest in a persistent sluggishness in the production of crude oil and natural gas sub-sectors ; yet , in spite of this drag , mining output accelerated , which was led by coal and refinery products .
manufacturing sector also gained speed over the year , particularly with respect to pharmaceuticals , motor vehicles , transport equipment , basic metals , petroleum products , wearing apparel , and machinery and equipment .
Despite a moderation in the dominant thermal segment , the electricity sector managed a slight uptick on the back of renewable energy sources .
Besides , a number of policy initiatives were taken by the government to strengthen the electricity sector such as a new coal linkage policy , push for more nuclear power plants , state specific plans on 24x7 power for all and the Integrated Power Development Scheme ( IPDS ) for strengthening sub-transmission and distribution infrastructure .
During the year , the gap between the average cost of supply and revenue realised by DISCOMs declined by 11 paise to 45 paise per kwh through cost realisation programmes and tariff hikes .
With lower demand for power and declining solar tariff , power purchase agreements ( PPAs ) have turned costly for DISCOMs and the Ultra Mega Thermal Power Projects ( UMPP ) have become unattractive .
All use-based segments , with the exception of primary goods ( which decelerated marginally , dragged by a decline in production of petrol , kerosene , urea and hard coke despite acceleration in mining and electricity ) and consumer durables , expanded at an accelerated pace during the year .
The pick-up in capital goods output in 2016-17 needs to be monitored closely as it has occurred on the back of a favourable base effect that , however , could not sustain it in April-June 2017 .
An important component of capital goods , namely , electrical equipment had been in contraction mode since October 2016 but machinery and equipment accelerated in 2016-17 .
In the infrastructure / construction goods segment , robust growth in steel products - HR coils , sheets , bars and rods of mild steel - driven both by domestic demand and exports , offset the slowdown in cement production .
The newly introduced pre-fabricated concrete blocks , however , remained in contraction mode for most part of 2016-17 along with other construction materials like glassware and cement clinkers .
The acceleration in intermediate goods was driven mostly by increased production of chemicals and chemical products , polymers and auto components .
The production of consumer durables was in contraction mode for the last four months of the year , and April-June 2017 too was dragged down by components like textiles , apparel , leather , wood and paper products .
Production of consumer non-durables , in contrast , grew steadily through the year and in April-June this year , driven by the phenomenal growth of ' digestive enzymes and antacids ' ; excluding this item group , the production of consumer non-durables would have been in contraction .
GVA in services decelerated in 2016-17 across sectors , barring PADO .
With respect to financial , real estate and professional services , the slowdown was the sharpest , accentuated by the impact of demonetisation on the cash-intensive real estate sector .
Reflecting the slackening of construction activity , steel consumption and cement production decelerated / contracted from their levels a year ago .
Some lead / coincident indicators of services activities , however , showed improvement during 2016-17 .
For instance , transportation activity - railway freight , port cargo and civil aviation - accelerated during 2016-17 .
Communication activity was boosted by increased competition in the sector and adoption of wireless broadband services with the entry of Reliance Jio .
Notwithstanding the transitory impact of demonetisation , automobile sales accelerated , reflecting up-tick in consumer sentiment , new launches and discount offers .
Foreign tourist arrivals grew robustly , providing a boost to trade , hotels and restaurants .
However , slowdown in construction and financial , real estate and professional services sector hurt services sector growth in Q4 : 2016-17 .
The Reserve Bank ' s ' service sector composite index ( SSCI ) , which extracts and combines information gleaned from high frequency indicators and statistically leads GVA growth in the services sector , is showing early signs of recovery , led by construction and trade - an upbeat steel consumption in Q1 : 2017-18 that is likely to be sustained by favourable base effects in the next quarter and the firming up of trade indicators ( chart II.9 ) .
During 2016-17 , emphasis was laid on investment in human capital , through initiatives in the form of various skill development and apprentice schemes with a view to improving the quality of labour and addressing skill gaps .
Going forward , consumption demand is likely to remain robust on the back of expected normal south-west monsoon and _ possible implementation of the 7 CPC at the state level , apart from the gathering pace of remonetisation .
Further , the thrust of the Union Budget on capital expenditure , housing , MSME and farm sector coupled with other reforms such as the implementation of GST from July 2017 and the Real Estate ( Regulation and Development ) Act ( RERA ) , 2016 is expected to reinvigorate economic activity during 2017-18 .
Headline inflation , measured by the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) , underwent exceptional movements during 2016-17 .
In the first four months of the year , favourable base effects could not restrain an extra-seasonal and monotonic surge in food prices across the board , barring cereals .
Food price pressures were exacerbated by the delayed onset of the south-west monsoon and consequently , headline inflation reached an intra-year peak of 6.1 per cent in July 2016 ( Chart II.10 ) .
As surprising as the intensity of this spike was , its sudden downturn from August 2016 unhinged expectations .
Once again , it was food prices at work - their rapid disinflation drove down headline inflation month after month - barring February and March 2017 - to a low Distribution of Inflation in India With headline CPI inflation easing from 5.8 per cent in 2014-15 to 4.5 per cent in 2016-17 , the likely level at which it would stabilise assumes importance .
Accordingly , CPI inflation is analysed at a disaggregated level for 2014-15 through 2016-17 , using a Markov chain framework .
Markov chain is a sequence of discrete time stochastic process .
The monthly switches in inflation for major groups of CPI rural / urban data sets across states were tracked across 32 defined bands of inflation .
The 32 bands were formed to cover every possible value of inflation , consisting of two extreme bands , viz . , ( i ) less than -10 per cent and ( ii ) equal to or more than 20 per cent , and 30 bands of equal width of one percentage point within the interval from -10 per cent to 20 per cent .
Given these initial conditions , transition probability matrices were constructed for full as well as filtered data sets ( i.e. , excluding the first and the last bands ) and steady state equilibria were derived under the Markov chain framework for each year as also for the full three-year period ( Chart 1 ) .
The central tendency of CPI inflation ( both mean and median ) in steady state using 2014-15 data is found to be lower than that using 2015-16 and 2016-17 data .
This is because inflation at the beginning of 2014-15 had hovered in higher bands before dipping sharply , leading to a relatively higher number of transitions from higher to lower bands .
In contrast , such transitions were limited during 2015-16 and 2016-17 , as inflation was range-bound .
The median inflation derived from the steady-state equilibrium for the combined three-year period is 4.13 per cent for the full data set and 4.10 per cent for the filtered data set ( Table 1 ) .
The corresponding standard deviation of inflation in respect of both the data sets has moderated , corroborating the convergence of the inflation to around 4 per cent .
The above analysis is based on the assumption that the transition probabilities , as estimated from the data set , do not change over time .
However , these probabilities could be impacted by changes in the nature of various shocks in the economy , going forward .
Subject to this caveat and purely on the basis of a stochastic process , this analysis provides preliminary evidence about the inflation rate , based on the new CPI series , converging to around 4 per cent .
In hindsight , the inflation outcomes since August 2016 mark the confluence of several forces .
First , as the monsoon quickly gained full strength and spatial spread , conditions came together for a bumper kharif crop .
Second , anecdotal evidence pointed towards fire sales of perishables from November 2016 post demonetisation .
Third , the cumulative impact of the government ' s supply management measures , particularly with regard to pulses , sent the disinflationary spiral into overdrive .
Given the paucity of data points , these factors are still difficult to disentangle but a combination of transitory and supply-side effects overwhelmed the firming up of global commodity prices from October 2016 as well as the unfavourable base effects that kicked in from December 2016 .
A modest uptick in inflation during February-March 2017 proved to be weak and short-lived and sub-3 per cent readings appeared in May-June 2017 .
In the event , inflation undershot the target of 5.0 per cent for Q4 of 2016-17 by 140 basis points .
However , a modest decline in inflation , excluding food and fuel , was witnessed during the first quarter of 2017-18 ( Box II.4 ) .
Decoding CPI Inflation Excluding Food and Fuel CPI inflation has declined sharply in recent years .
The underlying inflation as shaped by the pressure of aggregate demand against capacity is captured in the core component while the non- core part reflects short-term price movements caused by shocks or relative price changes ( see , e.g. , Lafleche and Armour 2006 ) .
Central banks generally monitor core inflation as it acts as a signal for persistent movements in inflation .
If headline inflation reverts to core inflation , the role of food and fuel price shocks is considered transitory .
On the other hand , if core inflation catches up with headline inflation , it suggests a generalised movement in prices through second round effects and inflation expectation channels ( Anand , et al . 2015 ) .
The observed deceleration in headline inflation in India in the recent period could , therefore , potentially be a transitory phenomenon in the wake of sharp correction in food prices and favourable terms of trade aided by a decline in global commodity prices .
The autoregressive coefficients , using an ARIMA model on a de-seasonalised CPI from January 2011 to March 2017 , corroborated persistence in inflation , both at the overall and sub-group levels , barring housing , and transport and communication ( Table 1 ) .
However , the degree of persistence varied across sub- groups .
For example , the level of inflation persistence was found to be relatively high for services components such as health and education .
Moreover , health and education inflation had lower volatility , suggesting relatively steady inflation .
The persistence in inflation could be attributable to multitudes of factors such as market structure , levels of productivity and habit formation .
Intensifying competition in goods and services markets coupled with productivity enhancing measures could help address persistence in inflation more on a durable basis .
During April-June 2017-18 , inflation excluding food and fuel declined and persistence also faded across all sub-groups .
On an annual average basis , inflation came down to 4.5 per cent in 2016-17 from 4.9 per cent in the previous year in a fairly generalised movement , except in the housing and miscellaneous categories ( Appendix Table 4 ) .
Household ' s inflation expectations adapted to salient price movements and broadly tracked inflation developments over the year as reflected in the March 2017 round of the Reserve Bank ' s inflation expectations survey conducted during the year .
An ebbing of inflation expectations was also corroborated in various rounds of the more forward-looking responses in the survey of professional forecasters .
Inflation edged up in a number of economies to or above target levels in 2016-17 , reflecting tighter labour market conditions and the firming up of commodity prices , especially crude oil and metals .
Turkey and South Africa remained outliers in an otherwise low inflation environment .
Globally , prices of agriculturalcommodities , especially food items , firmed up during the year due to a moderation in excess supply .
Global crude oil prices trended up after the OPEC ' s November 2016 decision to cut production by around 1.2 million barrels per day , 32.5 million barrels per day in the first half of 2017 .
The price of the Indian basket of crude oil moved in tandem and rose to about US $ 51 per barrel in March 2017 from around US $ 36 per barrel in March 2016 .
Intra-year movements in headline inflation were underpinned by significant shifts at the sub- group level .
Broadly , there was a sharp decline in the contribution of food and beverages in H2 : 2016-17 , while that of non-food components , notably transport and communication , and fuel and light , picked up .
Housing and services such as health and education were the other drivers of inflation ( Chart II.13 ) .
Inflation in food and beverages ( weight : 45.9 per cent in CPI ) , declined the most during 2016-17 , with its contribution to overall inflation down to 46 per cent from 49 per cent a year ago .
Both kharif and rabi seasons produced bumper harvests , aided by a normal monsoon after two consecutive years of drought-like conditions .
In January 2017 , food inflation touched an intra- year trough of 1.4 per cent , although prints in May and June took it down even lower to ( - ) 0.2 per cent and ( - ) 1.2 per cent , respectively ( Chart II.14 ) .
Perishable items - primarily vegetables - that account for 13 per cent of the food group in CPI were the principal agents driving the collapse of food inflation .
Vegetable prices faced an unprecedented downturn in August 2016 following significantly higher arrivals in mandis relative to the seasonal pattern .
The loss of momentum intensified from Q3 with demonetisation and fresh winter crop arrivals ( Chart II.15 ) .
While there was a sharp decline in prices of inflation-sensitive vegetables such as potatoes and tomatoes that typically provide the inflexion points in the trajectory of inflation , this time around it was the price of vegetables like cabbages , cauliflowers and peas that plunged disproportionately providing tangential evidence of distress sales and re-deployment of supplies towards urban areas post-demonetisation .
CPI- urban food inflation declined faster than its rural counterpart ( Chart II.16 ) .
The evolution of food prices from August 2016 points towards a possible role of non- transitory factors in bringing down inflation as reflected in a statistically significant break in the series .
This was corroborated by the vegetable price series , in particular .
Excluding vegetables , average food inflation would have been higher by 2.2 percentage points during August 2016-January 2017 ( Chart II.17 ) .
Pulses , with a weight of 5 per cent in the food group , contributed substantially to the large swings in food inflation during the year .
Their contribution to overall inflation shifted from ( + ) 12.6 per cent in the first half to ( - ) 3.6 per cent in the second half of the year .
The figures in parentheses indicate respective weights in overall pulses .
Gram was an outlier with an unprecedented surge in prices during 2016-17 , barring Q4 .
After two consecutive years of shortfalls , pulses production increased substantially to 23.0 million tonnes in 2016-17 from 16.4 million tonnes in the previous year in response to a normal rainfall and a significant increase in acreage incentivised by policy interventions , including an increase in MSP .
Other supply management measures taken by the government such as imports at zero duty , extension in stockholding limits for traders and building of buffer stocks also helped to rein in pulses inflation .
Within the overall moderation , sugar and confectionery posted double-digit inflation , reflecting a drop in sugar production .
In response , the government put in place a number of price control measures including imposition of stockholding limits on traders , discouraging exports of sugar and allowing imports of raw sugar .
Cereals and prepared meals also showed upside impulses in prices during the year .
The dwindling of wheat stocks below the quarterly buffer norm , beginning August 2016 , prompted supply-side measures in the form of reduction in import duty to zero in December 2016 that led to an upsurge in imports .
The fuel group ( 6.8 per cent weight in the CPI ) contributed 4.8 per cent to headline inflation during the year , down from 7.1 per cent a year ago .
Changes in administered prices of coal , electricity and LPG and hardening of prices of other household fuels including firewood and chips led to fuel inflation increasing from an average of 2.9 per cent till November 2016 to 4.1 per cent thereafter .
While in the case of kerosene there was a reduction in subsidy , domestic LPG prices rose in line with international prices .
As a result , input cost pressures picked up , especially with respect to raw materials and intermediates .
inflation excluding food and _ fuel remained sticky through the year with a modest ebbing since April 2017 ( Chart II.19 ) .
Inflation in transport and communication shot up from 0.7 per cent in May 2016 to 6.0 per cent in March 2017 , reflecting the increase in international crude oil prices .
Housing inflation increased during the year , although its contribution to inflation excluding food and fuel remained stable .
Inflation excluding food , fuel and petrol and diesel components of transportation averaged 4.9 per cent in 2016-17 , down from 5.2 per cent in the previous year .
In April 2017 , the Ministry of Commerce and Industry revised the base year for the Wholesale Price Index ( WPI ) from 2004-05 to 2011-12 in sync with CPI .
WPI inflation , based on the new series , ruled higher than CPI inflation from January 2017 , reflecting the rise in global commodity prices , particularly crude oil and metals .
WPI inflation reached an intra-year peak of 5.5 per cent in February 2017 before easing under the influence of fuel and power group .
As such , the narrowing of the gap between measures of inflation based on CPI and WPI , which started in October 2015 , got reversed in January 2017 before its re-emergence in June 2017 .
The WPI series is now akin to the Producer Price Index ( PPI ) as the former excludes indirect taxes .
The coverage of WPI was raised to 697 items from 676 and the number of quotations to 8,331 from 5,482 .
The primary articles ' group is now weighted higher while the weights of fuel and power and manufactured products have decreased .
In consonance with CPI and international practices , item level aggregation for WPI is based on geometric mean as against arithmetic mean in the old series .
The number of 2-digit groups in manufactured products has been increased from 12 to 22 as per the National Industrial Classification ( NIC ) - 2008 .
The index for electricity is now compiled as a _ unified item as against the earlier practice of separate sectoral indices such as for agriculture and industry .
A high level standing Technical Review Committee , headed by Secretary , Industrial Policy and Promotion has been set up to review and dynamically update the item basket in tune with the changing structure of the economy .
WPI inflation as per new series was lower during 2016-17 than that based on the old series , even as trends in inflation - overall and major sub- group-wise - remained largely unchanged in the new series .
For the year as a whole , while inflation as measured by WPI and GDP / GVA deflators increased during 2016-17 , sectoral CPI inflation based on CPI-IW , CPI-AL and CPI-RL eased in line with the overall CPI inflation .
Following the rise in global crude oil and metal prices , domestic farm and non-farm input costs posted considerable escalation in the second half of 2016-17 .
Moderate increases in MSPs were announced during the year for crops such as cereals and coarse grains , while the government continued to incentivise the production of pulses and oilseeds by raising their MSPs along with a hike in bonus for pulses .
Rural wage growth firmed up from August 2016 , both for agricultural and non-agricultural labourers .
In sum , during 2016-17 CPI inflation ebbed significantly largely reflecting the sharp downturn in the prices of pulses and vegetables following bumper production and supply management measures and later accentuated by the transitory effects of demonetisation .
Nonetheless , upside risks may emerge from input costs , wages and imported inflation .
Several significant developments fundamentally impacted the evolution of monetary aggregates during 2016-17 .
Up to October 2016 , market operations , intended to balance system- level liquidity , set the path of reserve money and money supply .
Thereafter , demonetisation and its after-effects , i.e. , initial limits on cash withdrawals , war-time operations to absorb the resultant liquidity overhang and the rapid pace of remonetisation , altered their paths drastically as portrayed in sub-sections 1 and 2 .
Somewhat obscured underneath these tectonic shifts , was a large redemption of FCNR ( B ) deposits swapped with the Reserve Bank at the time of the taper tantrum , with counter-balancing operations to even out the liquidity effects .
During the year , a combination of factors also restrained the demand for and supply of bank credit ( as brought out in sub-section 3 ) and consequently , the mobilisation of deposits .
Since January 2017 , however , the monetary aggregates are progressively realigning with their usual patterns .
Over the first seven months of 2016-17 , the behaviour of reserve money ( RM ) was largely conditioned by the stance of liquidity management - the Reserve Bank ' s resolve in its April 2016 bi- monthly policy statement of progressively moving ex ante liquidity in the system towards neutrality .
In terms of components , currency in circulation ( CIC ) rose sharply in Q1 but fell back in Q2 , reflecting the usual seasonality .
During this seven-month period , bankers ' balances with the Reserve Bank - the other component of RM - unwound from the usual balance sheet related build up at the end of March 2016 and banks generally economised on their holdings of excess reserves in view of the Reserve Bank ' s liquidity provision operations in consonance with its stance including the reduction in daily maintenance requirements with respect to the cash reserve ratio ( CRR ) from 95 per cent to 90 per cent .
While banks ' vault cash shot up in the immediate aftermath , it quickly dropped as the Reserve Bank mounted unprecedented liquidity absorption operations ( see Chapter III ) to mop up the massive influx of liquidity as SBNs were returned by the public .
As a result of these large changes , a downward spiral in RM took it down to ₹ 13.8 trillion ( 61 per cent of the peak ) by January 6 , 2017 .
As remonetisation gathered pace , CIC moved up week after week and reached 74.3 per cent of the peak by the end of the financial year .
At end-March 2017 , CIC amounted to 8.8 per cent of GDP , down from 12.2 per cent in the previous year .
At this level , India ' s currency to GDP ratio compares well with a host of advanced and emerging market economies ( Such as Germany , France , Italy , Thailand and Malaysia ) .
As in the past , scheduled commercial banks ( SCBs ) built up sizable year-end balances , even as excess reserves maintained by them came down to 17 per cent at end-March 2017 from 23 per cent a year ago .
For the year as a whole , RM contracted by around 13 per cent for the first time after 1952- 53 , as against a similar order of expansion in 2015-16 .
CIC declined by ₹ 3.3 trillion , while bankers ' balances with the Reserve Bank increased by ₹ 423 billion .
As at end-March 2017 , the net Reserve Bank credit to banks and commercial sector declined by ₹ 6.1 trillion vis-a- vis an increase of ₹ 1trillion in the previous year .
On the sources side , the year began with considerable turbulence in global financial markets amidst worries about global growth .
With capital influx dwindling , accretions to net foreign assets ( NFAs ) through net purchases from authorised dealers ( ADs ) were relatively muted during Q1 ( Chart II.22 ) .
As financial markets priced in the Brexit referendum , capital inflows resumed in Q2 and accordingly , the pace of OMO purchases moderated to ₹ 200 billion .
Net purchases from ADs increased from ₹ 78 billion in Q1 to ₹ 680 billion in Q2 .
Furthermore , the transfer of the Reserve Bank ' s surplus of ₹ 659 billion in August 2016 augmented spending by the government and added to the liquidity in the banking system .
Initially , reverse repos under the liquidity adjustment facility ( LAF ) were the principal instrument of absorption , bringing net Reserve Bank credit to banks and the commercial sector down to ₹ ( - ) 5.2 trillion as on November 25 , 2016 from ₹ 3 trillion at the beginning of the year .
The government ' s cash balances also declined by ₹ 613 billion by end- March 2017 and as a result , net Reserve Bank credit to the government increased to ₹ 6.2 trillion by the end of the year vis-a-vis ₹ 4.2 trillion a year ago .
A comparison of the Reserve Bank ' s balance sheet size pre- and post-demonetisation shows a decline of ₹ 0.8 trillion ( 2.4 per cent ) during against an increase of ₹ 4.7 trillion ( 16.1 per cent ) in the corresponding period a year ago .
Moreover , the composition of liabilities changed significantly , with the share of the largest component , viz . , notes in circulation declining sharply from 54.3 per cent as on November 4 , 2016 to 27 per cent. as on January 6 , 2017 before increasing to 41.1 per cent at end-March 2017 per cent at end-March 2017 .
Furthermore , the MSS impound and other deposits ( mainly LAF reverse repo with banks ) increased significantly .
The switch from non-interest bearing currency liabilities to interest bearing deposits , coupled with a decline in the Reserve Bank ' s credit to banks , has implications for the Reserve Bank ' s surplus .
In 2017-18 ( upto June 30 ) , with CIC falling short of its level a year ago by ₹ 2.0 trillion , RM was lower by 5.6 per cent .
Net Reserve Bank credit to the government and to the banks and the commercial sector drove down the RM , offsetting the upward push from net purchases from authorised dealers .
The year-on-year growth of money supply ( M , ) slackened during 2016-17 , reflecting subdued credit growth and a sizable redemption of FCNR ( B ) deposits .
Barring a short-lived spike during Diwali , the deceleration became sharper in the second half following demonetisation .
Turning to the components of money supply , currency with the public largely followed the patterns of CIC discussed in the preceding section .
Aggregate and demand deposits follow a seasonal pattern akin to currency with the public , while time deposits are largely stable .
However , in 2016-17 , aggregate deposits increased sharply in Q2 on account of the release of the 7 CPC award of salaries and pension arrears and mobilisation of deposits under the income declaration scheme .
The pace of deposits turned somewhat tempered by the redemption of FCNR ( B ) deposits mobilised under the Bank ' s swap scheme , which coincided with demonetisation .
As a result , the increment in deposits post-demonetisation till mid- February was less than the contraction in currency with the public ( Chart II.23 ) .
The M , growth in 2017-18 ( upto June 23 , 2017 ) at 7.4 per cent remained much lower than the growth registered in the corresponding fortnight last year ( 10.3 per cent ) .
On the sources side , the growth in net bank credit to the government accelerated sharply reflecting the quantum increase in banks ' investment in government securities in the context of a surge in deposits following demonetisation .
On the other hand , growth in credit to the commercial sector moderated during the year mainly due to lower credit growth of PSBs .
In contrast to the previous year , the currency- deposit ( c / d ) ratio underwent a steep fall due to the contraction in currency with the public and the concomitant increase in deposits .
On the other hand , the reserve-deposit ( r / d ) ratio remained largely stable , barring the fortnight when the incremental CRR of 100 per cent was applied and the last fortnight of the financial year .
The money multiplier , which hovered around 5.5 in the pre- demonetisation phase , scaled up to peak at 8.8 by early January 2017 .
As remonetisation quickened , the money multiplier declined gradually but remained elevated relative to its own history at 6.8 at end-March 2017 ( 5.3 a year ago ) .
The growth in non-food credit extended by scheduled commercial banks ( SCBs ) reached a low of 5.8 per cent at end-March 2017 , the lowest since 1994-95 ( 10.9 per cent in the previous year ) .
Non-food credit expansion in the last fortnight accounted for 74.2 per cent of the annual increase ( 38.3 per cent in the previous year ) .
In a bank-based economy , bank credit is considered critical in determining output ( Korkmaz , 2015 ) .
Higher credit growth is expected to lead to higher GVA growth and vice versa .
However , in recent years , there appears to be a disconnect in the growth rates of credit and GVA in India ( Chart 1 ) .
The anaemic growth in bank credit in the recent period is attributed to various factors such as stressed assets , subdued economic activity and sticky capacity utilisation .
The quarterly seasonally adjusted data on real bank credit and GVA for 1996-2017 and sectoral credit for 2007-17 were found to be non-stationary in levels but stationary in first difference .
A long-run co-integrating relation between credit and GVA has been estimated as :
Dummies for 2009-10 Q2 to 2012-13 Q1 ( identified through least squares with breakpoints ) and for 2015-16 Q2 to 2016-17 Q4 were used to account for the global financial crisis and asset quality review of banks by the Reserve Bank , respectively .
Equation ( 1 ) indicates that with every 1 per cent increase in real credit , real GVA increases by 0.64 per cent .
Further , the error correction term has a negative sign and is statistically significant , implying that the underlying mechanism corrects disequilibrium .
Dummy was used for the period since the asset quality review of banks by the Reserve Bank .
At a sectoral level , credit to agriculture and services was associated with higher output ; however , industrial credit was not found to be statistically significant , possibly reflecting substitution by other sources of finance such as commercial papers and corporate bonds ( RBI 2015 ) .
The large and statistically significant coefficient of services ' credit may be seen in the context of an increase in the share of the services sector ' s credit in total non-food credit from 23 per cent in 2007 to 26 per cent in 2017 .
The healthy growth in credit to the services sector in recent years was driven by professional services , retail trade , NBFCs and transport operators .

Even inclusive of CPs , non-food credit growth during 2016-17 was lower at 6.4 per cent as against 10.2 per cent in the previous year .
Real credit growth showed a sharp deceleration to 1.8 per cent from 5.8 per cent a year ago .
In terms of intra-year variations , non-food credit flow dipped albeit a little more than usual in the first quarter of 2016- 17 before posting a sharp recovery in the next quarter - a contrast to its customary behaviour ( Chart 11.25 ) .
While non-food credit flows started receding thereafter , a declining momentum got entrenched in the aftermath of demonetisation .
However , it recovered somewhat towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2016-17 , reflecting the usual year-end window dressing .
During 2017- 18 ( upto June 23 , 2017 ) , NFC growth remained lower at 6.7 per cent when compared with the growth of 9.3 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year .
Among bank groups , public sector banks trailed behind private banks in terms of credit growth during 2016-17 , a secular-like movement evident since 2011-12 .
Credit to agriculture slowed down to 12.4 per cent from 15.3 per cent in the previous year .
Credit to industry , particularly infrastructure , food processing and iron and steel segments , has been contracting since October 2016 .
Credit to industry contracted by 1.9 per cent during 2016-17 in contrast to a growth of 2.7 percentin the previous year .
Credit to infrastructure ( which accounts for about one-third of the outstanding bank credit to industry ) contracted by 6.1 per cent in 2016- 17 on top of a low growth of 4.4 per cent in the previous year .
Within infrastructure , credit growth contracted / decelerated in respect of all major segments such as power , telecommunication and roads .
Credit to textiles and engineering goods also slowed .
However , credit to fertilisers , petro chemicals and construction activity accelerated sharply .
The overall contraction in credit to industry was due to the inter-play of several factors .
First , investment activity has been weak in recent years , which has severely impacted credit offtake .
Second , within industry , several sector-specific factors contributed to contraction in credit .
For example , the power sector , which accounts for about 58 per cent of the outstanding credit to infrastructure , has been facing hurdles like stalled projects , operational inefficiencies and high outstanding debt .
Telecommunication industries were experiencing declining revenue and a grim profit outlook due to technological innovations and stiff competition among the service providers .
The iron and steel sector was stressed due to weak prices and stiff international competition .
Belying the general trend , personal loans continued to grow at a healthy rate , although the growth was somewhat lower ( 16.4 per cent vis- a-vis 19.4 per cent in the previous year ) due to marked deceleration in housing loans which constituted more than half of the outstanding credit to this sector .
Credit flow to the services sector improved significantly to 16.9 per cent from 9.1 per cent last year led by the professional services and trade .
During 2017-18 ( up to June 2017 ) , overall credit slowdown has persisted with most sectors witnessing deceleration or contraction .
While credit to industry continued to contract , credit growth to agriculture slowed down significantly to 7.5 per cent in June 2017 from 13.8 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year .
Credit to the services sector decelerated sharply , reflecting slowdown across all its sub-components , barring trade and other services .
During 2016-17 , the flow of financial resources to the commercial sector declined , largely mirroring the anaemic non-food credit ( Table II.6 ) .
In contrast , banks ' non-SLR investment increased sharply by 47.2 per cent while the flow of resources from non-banks recorded an uptick .
Within non-bank sources , notably , private placements by non-financial entities and CPs subscribed by non-banks increased during the year .
Among foreign sources , external commercial borrowings ( ECB ) / foreign currency convertible bonds ( FCCB ) recorded net outflows for the second year in a row , while the flow of FDI was largely sustained .
The primary issuance of corporate bonds was dominated by private placements vis-a-vis public issues , with the former constituting 95.7 per cent of total issuance in 2016-17 , up from 92.1 per cent in the previous year .
Further , the share of financial entities as against non-financial entities in the resource mobilisation through corporate bonds increased to 71.7 per cent from 71.2 per cent over the same period .
During 2017-18 ( up to June 2017 ) , the share of financial entities increased further to 84.6 per cent over the previous year .
In sum , the evolution of monetary and liquidity conditions during 2016-17 were shaped by developments such as the withdrawal of SBNs , redemption of FCNR ( B ) deposits , liquidity management stance of the Reserve Bank and global factors .
The fast pace of currency expansion was reversed by demonetisation leading to a surge in liquidity in the system and a slew of measures by the Reserve Bank to manage it .
Subdued credit growth and redemption of FCNR ( B ) moderated money supply growth .
With liquidity and currency levels progressing towards neutral / normal , the resolution of stressed assets and recapitalisation of public sector banks will be critical for improving credit off-take .
Sporadic episodes of volatility buffeted global financial markets during 2016-17 , largely reflecting uncertainties surrounding the materialisation of political risks such as the unexpected outcome of the Brexit referendum and the results of the US Presidential election .
Market sentiment was also unsettled by increased prospects of monetary policy tightening by the US .
While markets in advanced economies ( AEs ) generally relied on reflation trade on perceptions of better growth prospects , those in emerging market economies ( EMEs ) plunged on fears of capital outflows and the Fed rate hike .
Subsequently , however , equity prices recovered in most EMEs as capital outflows ceased and inflows resumed as reflation exuberance subsided and the stance of the US Federal Reserve was read as being less hawkish .
The domestic forex market remained stable for most part of the year with the Indian rupee ( INR ) mostly trading with an appreciating bias , except during episodic turbulence caused by global factors .
As a result , the average monthly liquidity deficit in the system consistently declined from April through June 2016 .
Consequently , WACR remained anchored to the policy repo rate and traded with an easing bias within the policy interest rate corridor .
Demonetisation in November led to a significant softening of money market rates lasting till the end of the financial year .
Notwithstanding the unprecedented surplus liquidity conditions , money market rates were generally aligned with the policy rate with a downward bias from December 2016 , mainly on account of proactive liquidity management by the Reserve Bank involving , inter alia , temporary imposition of the incremental CRR ( ICRR ) during the fortnight beginning November stabilisation scheme ( MSS ) and absorption through the overnight fixed rate reverse repo and variable rate reverse repos of various tenors ranging from overnight to 91-days .
The outstanding issuances under MSS peaked at ₹ 5,966 billion in mid-January 2017 .
Moreover , the usual financial year-end spike in money market rates remained muted in 2016- 17 on account of persistence of surplus liquidity in the system .
Average daily volume in the money market [ call money , collateralised borrowing and lending obligation ( CBLO ) and market repo ] increased significantly by 32 per cent to ₹ 1,441 billion during 2016-17 from ₹ 1,090 billion in 2015-16 .
Volume in call money , CBLO and market repo segments increased by 13 per cent , 32 per cent and 41 per cent , respectively , during the year .
During Q1 of 2017-18 , average daily volume in money market ( call money , CBLO and market repo ) increased further to ₹ 1,575 billion .
Surfeit of liquidity with banks and enervated credit growth obviated the need for mobilising bulk deposits and , as a consequence , the issuance of certificates of deposit ( CDs ) declined substantially .
The weighted average effective interest rate ( WAEIR ) on CDs also declined by 1.8 percentage points in 2016-17 .
The average fortnightly issuance during Q1 of 2017-18 was lower than Q4 of 2016-17 and there was a marginal uptick in WAEIR during the period .
Weighted average discount rate ( WADR ) on CPs generally declined during the year .
Furthermore , the Reserve Bank undertook issuance of treasury bills ( T-Bills ) under MSS and OMO sale auctions in addition to regular LAF operations .
The average daily outstanding net liquidity absorption under LAF was ₹ 3,558 billion in Q1 of 2017-18 .
The aggregate volume of transactions in central and state governments dated securities and T-bills ( outright as well as repo ) increased by 56 per cent , even as yields generally softened during the year , barring some occasional upticks in Q4 ( Chart 11.27 ) .
In Q1 , yields remained range-bound with a softening bias on the back of positive sentiment following a reduction in the policy repo rate on April stance and reduction in the minimum daily CRR maintenance requirements , coupled with stability in the domestic foreign exchange market , expectations of monetary easing by major central banks and an increased likelihood of a dovish stance of the US monetary policy .
Yields , however , hardened transiently in the run up to the Brexit referendum on June 23 .
Yields continued to soften in Q2 of 2016- 17 , tracking positive market sentiments generated by the passage of the constitutional amendment bill enabling the introduction of Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) , coupled with comfortable liquidity conditions .
G-sec yields hardened marginally after the release of Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) minutes in mid-October 2016 , which markets read as signalling an imminent raising of rates in the US .
Yields continued to trade in a narrow range till mid- December 2016 .
With the policy repo rate held unchanged , a change in the policy stance from accommodative to neutral in February 2017 caused a sharp sell-off in gilts .
It was only when positive market sentiments returned post-state election results and the less hawkish stance of the US Fed around mid-March 2017 that a mild softening of yields ensued which lasted till the end of the financial year .
Yields hardened moderately in April 2017 following the enunciation of upside risks to inflation in the minutes of the Reserve Bank ' s Monetary Policy Committee meeting , released hardened initially tracking the US yields ahead of the outcome of the FOMC meeting on May 03 , 2017 .
Subsequently , yields softened on account of a fall in crude oil prices , issuance of a new 10- year benchmark security and lower than expected inflation numbers for April 2017 .
Yields softened further after the monetary policy statement on yield moving in a range-bound manner following the release of lower reading on CPI inflation in June 2017 .
Taking advantage of low yields , the resources mobilised through the corporate bond market increased to ₹ 6,700 billion during 2016-17 from ₹ 4,922 billion in the previous year .
Corporate bond yields softened during 2016-17 , tracking movements in G-sec yields and measures taken by the Reserve Bank and the Government to deepen the corporate bond market .
These measures include a hike in the aggregate limit of partial credit enhancement provided by banks , permission to brokers in corporate bond repos , and authorisation of a platform for repo in corporate bonds .
The 5-year AAA rated corporate bond yield softened by 0.8 percentage point during the year .
However , the yield spread of the 5-year AAA rated corporate bond over 5 year G-sec increased during the year reflecting higher perception of credit risk ( Chart 11.28 ) .
The turnover in the corporate bond market increased by around 44 per cent during 2016-17 .
Foreign portfolio investment in corporate bonds increased to ₹ 1.9 trillion at end-March 2017 from ₹ 1.7 trillion in the previous year and accounted for 76 per cent of the limit as compared to 69 per cent a year ago .
During Q1 of 2017-18 , resources mobilised through corporate bonds increased to ₹ 1 , 747 billion from ₹ 1,364 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year .
The turnover in corporate bonds also increased substantially to ₹ 4,347 billion from ₹ 2,610 billion over the same period .
The yield of 5-year AAA rated corporate bonds softened by 16 bps in Q1 of 2017-18 .
Also , the yield spread of the 5-year AAA rated corporate bond over 5-year G-sec declined by 14 bps reflecting moderation in the perceived credit risk .
During 2016-17 , the benchmark Indian equity indices , / .e. , the BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 increased by 16.9 per cent and 18.5 per cent , respectively ,
Following demonetisation , however , the BSE indices of cash-sensitive sectors such as realty , fast-moving consumer goods ( FMCGs ) and automobiles declined sharply , indicating market expectations of a fall in demand .
The stock markets , however , rallied thereafter on better-than-expected Q3 earnings of companies , optimism over Union Budget 2017-18 proposals to stimulate growth while adhering to the path of gradual fiscal consolidation , revival of foreign portfolio investments with a record net buying in March 2017 , better than expected Q3 GDP growth data , passage of the GST Bill in the Lok Sabha and expectations of steady progress on economic reforms .
In fact , the BSE Sensex and sectoral indices , except BSE auto , surpassed their pre-demonetisation levels in Q4 of 2016-17 , indicating that the impact of demonetisation was only transitory .
In Q1 of 2017-18 , the BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty 50 increased by 4.4 per cent and 3.8 per cent , respectively in the backdrop of favourable progress in monsoon , perseverance with economic reforms , strong macroeconomic fundamentals and positive cues from global markets .
Indian Equity Prices : A Sustainability Analysis The Indian stock markets surged in 2017 vis-a-vis their peers , with the BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty 50 trading at all-time highs with stretched valuations .
This has sparked a lively debate as to whether the stock market exuberance is durable ( Chart 1 ) .
The market price of an asset consists of a fundamental component , i.e. , the expected discounted flow of the asset price and a bubble component , which is defined as a dramatic rise in asset prices driven by speculative behaviour , far exceeding its fundamental value .
The fundamental component is expected to change fairly gradually over time , while the bubble component can increase in an explosive or exponential manner .
The empirical identification of asset price bubbles has been animatedly debated ( see , Diba and Grossman 1988 ) .
( 2015 ) used a variant of the standard ADF unit root test , viz . , the generalised supremum ADF ( GSADF ) test on the following reduced form equation :
The presence of explosive behaviour in the asset price , can be taken as evidence of a bubble .
This methodology was applied to the inflation adjusted price- to-dividend ratio of the average monthly BSE Sensex during April 1994 to April 2017 , taking the ratio of April 1994 as the baseline .
The GSADF test statistic was greater than the critical value at 1 per cent level , possibly indicating evidence of bubbles in the market ( Table 1 ) .
Another bubble is identified during August 2014 to February 2015 the aftermath of the general election results , which ended on concerns over retrospective taxes on FPIs , high valuations and weak earnings growth .
The primary segment of the equity market sustained its upward momentum during 2016-17 against the backdrop of improved macroeconomic conditions and policy reforms such as passage of GST Bill .
Resource mobilisation through initial public offerings ( IPOs ) more than doubled to ₹ 291 billion in 2016-17 .
IPO activity remained subdued during October 2016 to February 2017 in view of the volatility in the stock markets and the post-demonetisation uncertainty , but recovered in March 2017 .
No bubble is detected currently when stock prices have reached historical highs .
Resource mobilisation through mutual funds ( MFs ) more than doubled to ₹ 3,431 billion in 2016-17 on account of higher mobilisation under income and debt schemes .
During Q1 of 2017-18 , mutual fund resource mobilisation increased by 3.3 per cent to ₹ 934 billion from ₹ 904 billion in the same period of the previous year .
Private placement of corporate bonds showed a marked improvement of 39.9 per cent in 2016- 17 vis-a-vis 13 per cent in 2015-16 .
During Q1 of 2017-18 , private placement of corporate bonds increased by 28.3 per cent to ₹ 1,725 billion from ₹ 1,345 billion in the corresponding period of 2016- 17 .
Public issues of non-convertible debentures ( NCDs ) , however , decreased by 14.0 per cent in 2016-17 as against a very high growth of 262 per cent in 2015-16 .
But , during Q1 of 2017-18 , public issues of NCDs increased by 15 per cent over the corresponding period last year .
Resource mobilisation through qualified institutional placements ( QIPs ) declined by 42 per cent during 2016-17 on top of a decline of 50 per cent in 2015-16 .
However , it recovered during 2017-18 so far ( upto May 2017 ) .
During April-May 2017 , ₹ 125 billion was raised through seven QIP issues .
Indian companies mobilised US ₹ 3,671 million through offshore Rupee-denominated bonds ( Masala Bonds ) during 2016-17 .
The framework of Masala Bonds was harmonised with the guidelines on external commercial borrowings in June 2017 for providing an additional avenue for Indian corporates and banks to raise longer-term funds .
The Indian foreign exchange ( forex ) market was generally stable during 2016-17 , except for brief episodes of volatility .
In March 2017 , INR appreciated strongly in response to domestic political developments .
The episodes of volatility can becorroborated by conditional variance from an estimated exponential generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic ( EGARCH ) model ( Chart 11.30 ) .
However , viewed in relation to EME peers , the implied volatility of INR was one of the lowest and hovered in a narrow range ( Chart II.31 ) .
During the first half of 2016-17 , INR traded mostly in a range mid-May to mid-July 2016 when it came under pressure due to the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit referendum .
In fact , INR , which stood at 66.33 per US dollar at end-March 2016 , touched a low of 68.01 per US dollar on June 24 , 2016 , the day of the Brexit referendum result .
However , INR recovered by early July and remained range- bound .
In November 2016 , INR again came under downward pressure from simultaneous impact of the result of the US Presidential election and demonetisation in India .
Uncertainties surrounding the policies of the new US _ administration generated sharp volatility in currencies across the globe .
US bond yields rose sharply on speculation that the Federal Reserve ' s rate hikes during 2017 might be steeper than anticipated .
This led to large FPI outflows aggregating US $ 9.5 billion from the Indian debt and equity markets during November-December 2016 .
Notwithstanding this , repayments of the FCNR ( B ) swaps with banks amounting to US $ 24 billion were conducted smoothly over September - December 2016 .
At the beginning of 2017 , the markets turned cautious due to uncertainty over the new US President ' s protectionist policies .
However , INR posted significant gains following the announcements in the Union Budget 2017-18 on steep rate hikes by the Federal Reserve post the 2017 , INR appreciated significantly as domestic political developments signalled stability on policy issues .
The strengthening bias of INR was generally sustained during April through June 2017 on continued FPI inflows .
During Q1 of 2017-18 , INR traded in the range of 64.00 to 65.04 per US dollar .
The recent appreciation of the INR has regenerated a debate on its fair value ( Box II.7 ) .
The appreciation of the Indian rupee ( INR ) against the US dollar ( US $ ) since January 2017 has rekindled the debate on the fair value of the INR .
Further , the Dollar Index suggests that US $ has been depreciating over the past six months ( Chart 2 ) , likely on account of inflation outlook , dovish Fed guidance , and uncertain political climate in the US .
But the India-US inflation differential , as seen in Chart 1 , has declined significantly compared to 2014 , and the INR is not the only currency that has appreciated vis-a-vis US $ , other currencies of emerging market economies ( EMEs ) ( Chart 3 ) .
The equilibrium value of the currency is then estimated based on the gap between the actual and the sustainable CA and the elasticity of CA with respect to the exchange rate .
The B-S theory suggests that as EMEs grow over time , labour productivity of their traded-goods sector will tend to rise , spilling over to wages and prices in the non-traded goods , and thereby leading to an increase in the overall price level ( Balassa 1964 ; Rogoff 1996 ) , causing the currency to appreciate .
( 1 ) below is estimated using the 2014 cross-section for 180 countries from the Penn World Tables ( version 9.0 ) , latest available in the database .
measures the equilibrium impact of economic growth on the real exchange rate .
The coefficient estimated for B is 0.23 for the 2014 cross-section of countries ( Chart 4 ) .
The estimated coefficient is used to project the increase in REER between 2014 and 2017 for a predicted increase in Yi for India .
Sustainable Current Account Approach Another approach to determine REER valuation relies on a normative evaluation of current accounts and exchange rates .
One way to assess a sustainable level for the current account is based on the " External Sustainability ' ( ES ) approach developed by the Consultative Group on Exchange Rate Issues ( CGER , IMF ) .
Rangarajan and Mishra ( 2013 ) applied this approach to India and estimated the sustainable current account deficit ( CAD ) to be 2.3 per cent of GDP .
This approach , therefore , suggests that the CAD at 0.6 per cent of GDP in Q4 : 2016-17 is below the level that can be sustained over the medium term .
Although the PPP approach captures simultaneity of exchange rate determination covering maximum number of countries , it could have its limitation in determining country specific fair value .
FII net inflows include FII inflows into both equity and debt .
A sensitivity analysis using a + 1 percentage point band around the sustainable-CAD to GDP ratio suggests that the Indian REER as of June 2017 , is broadly aligned to its fair value to being moderately undervalued .
In contrast , the real effective exchange rate ( REER ) of the INR appreciated for the third successive year , though marginally , mirroring the increase in India ' s relative price index vis-a-vis its trade partners .
While activity in the merchant segment remained at the previous year ' s level , inter-bank turnover showed a slight uptick .
Overall , activity in both the spot and forward / swap segments picked up during 2016-17 .
Short run nominal exchange rate movements in EMEs ( Chart 5 ) incorporate several other factors , capital flows perhaps being the most important among them , and require further careful analysis .
Revenue mobilisation became the cornerstone of fiscal consolidation in 2016-17 , enabling the central government to achieve the targets for key deficit indicators ;
While revenue expenditure was broadly maintained at the budgeted level , capital expenditure was stepped up over and above the budget estimates ( BE ) .
The government has budgeted to bring down the gross fiscal deficit ( GFD ) and the revenue deficit ( RD ) further in 2017-18 ( see subsection 2 ) .
At the sub- national level , all the three major deficit indicators - the consolidated GFD , the primary and revenue deficit to GDP ratios - overshot the BE for 2016- 17 .
States plan to rein in their primary and fiscal deficits and post a revenue surplus in 2017-18 ( see subsections 3 and 4 for a disaggregated analysis ) .
Net tax revenue of the centre ( net of devolution to states ) exceeded the budgeted amount by 4.6 per cent .
While gross direct tax revenues were buoyed by collections of around ₹ 674 billion under the Income Declaration Scheme ( IDS ) , higher revenues from indirect taxes were generated by an upward revision in clean environment cess , imposition of an infrastructure cess on certain motor vehicles , additional excise duty on jewellery articles and increase in excise duty on tobacco products .
The imposition of the Krishi Kalyan Cess on services from June 1 , 2016 and pruning of the negative list fortified service tax collections .
Customs duty collections were , however , circumscribed by subdued imports .
Non-tax revenues recorded a shortfall of 15.1 per cent from budgetary targets , mainly on account of lower receipts from interest , dividends and profits .
Receipts from communication services fell short of the budgeted targets as high value spectrum bands remained unsold .
Proceeds from disinvestment - amounting to ₹ 477 billion - were the highest in any financial year so far , even though they were lower than the BE by 15.5 per cent due to a shortfall from the strategic sale target .
Nonetheless , total non-debt receipts registered a growth of 14.5 per cent during the year vis-a-vis 9.1 per cent in the previous year .
Reflecting these developments , the budgeted target for GFD-GDP ratio at 3.5 per cent was met in the Provisional Accounts ( PA ) .
Owing to robust tax revenues , the RD-GDP ratio at 2.0 per cent was lower than the budgeted 2.3 per cent ( Table II.7 ) .
The discussion on central government finances for 2016-17 is based on Provisional Accounts ( PA ) while that on states for the same year is based on Revised Estimates ( RE ) .
The central government remains committed to fiscal consolidation , budgeting a 0.3 percentage point reduction in the GFD-GDP ratio for 2017-18 .
The timeline for attainment of the target of 3.0 per cent has , however , been shifted from 2017-18 to 2018-19 .
This deferment was also a deviation from the fiscal roadmap proposed by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management ( FRBM ) Review Committee , 2017 ( Chairman : Shri N.K. Singh ) ( Box II.8 ) .
The budgeted reduction in _ deficit indicators is based on increases in tax revenues and disinvestment proceeds , and containment of the growth in expenditure .
At the same time , enhanced budgetary allocations have been made for the farm and rural sectors , the social sector , infrastructure and employment generation .
The buoyancy of gross tax revenue is budgeted to decline to 1.03 in 2017-18 from 1.64 in 2016-17 .
Conservative accounting of potential revenue from the likely implementation of the Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) also impinged on the budget estimates .
Direct tax revenues , on the other hand , are expected to be supported by a surcharge of 10 per cent on the income bracket of ₹ 5 million to ₹ 10 million .
Non-tax revenues are budgeted to increase by a modest 5.3 per cent .
This is proposed to be achieved through a ₹ 465 billion stake sale in Public Sector Enterprises ( PSEs ) , ₹ 150 billion disinvestment in strategic and minority stake holdings and ₹ 110 billion by listing of insurance companies .
The government has merged plan and non-plan expenditure with a view to simplifying budget accounts .
Total expenditure is shown as ' scheme ' and ' other than scheme ' expenditure .
Recommendations of the FRBM Review Committee The FRBM Review Committee ( Chairman : Shri N. K. Singh ) , constituted in May 2016 was mandated to ( i ) look into various aspects , factors and considerations going into determining FRBM targets ; ( ii ) judge the merit of having a fiscal deficit range as the target in place of the existing point estimates ; and ( iii ) examine the need and feasibility of aligning the fiscal expansion / contraction with credit contraction / expansion in the economy .
The Committee , which submitted its report in January 2017 , proposed the establishment of a new fiscal framework for India designed to target the debt-to-GDP ratio , in addition to the existing deficit targets .
Separate debt targets for the central and the state governments have been recommended to align with solvency considerations , following international best practices in order to avoid the threat of a debt trap .
In order to improve fiscal governance , the Committee recommended setting up of an autonomous fiscal council under the Ministry of Finance .
For the first time in India , the Committee outlined a well-defined escape clause as well as a buoyancy clause , clearly setting out the conditions under which these can be invoked .
The new rules include a proposal for a prudent medium-term ceiling for general government debt of 60 per cent of GDP - 40 per cent for the centre and the balance 20 per cent for the states - to be achieved no later than 2022-23 .
In this context , one of the earlier studies also found that a reasonable and feasible public debt ceiling for India ' s medium-term fiscal framework could be in the range of 60-65 per cent of GDP ( Topalova and Nyberg 2010 ) .
Concomitantly , the revenue deficit-GDP ratio is projected to decline steadily by 0.25 percentage point each year to reach 0.8 per cent in 2022-23 .
Capital expenditure is budgeted to grow at 6.7 per cent , with emphasis on priority areas such as physical infrastructure and the social sector .
Even in the above circumstances , deviations from the stipulated GFD-GDP ratio target should not exceed 0.5 percentage point in a year .
In addition , there is a buoyancy clause which can be invoked by the government if there is a sharp increase in real output growth of at least 3 percentage points above the average for the previous four quarters .
In this scenario , the fiscal deficit must fall by at least 0.5 percentage point below the target .
The Committee also recommended the constitution of a fiscal council comprising experts in public finance , economics , or public affairs to provide an independent assessment of the central government ' s fiscal performance and compliance with targets .
In terms of institutional reforms in fiscal management , the Committee recommended ( i ) issuing detailed policy guidelines by the central government to provide proactive guidance to state governments ; ( ii ) assigning to the 15 " " Finance Commission the task of determining inter-state allocations for state governments for achievement of the overall debt and fiscal targets ; ( iii ) requesting the Reserve Bank of India to arrange for issuance of a consolidated annual prospectus of planned annual bond and loan issuances by each state government ; and ( iv ) introducing credit ratings for each prospectus by approved credit rating agencies .
With a view to enhancing fiscal transparency , the Committee recommended adoption of international best practices for compilation and presentation of fiscal accounts , as laid out in the International Monetary Fund ' s Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 .
Expenditure on major subsidies , viz . , food , fuel and fertiliser is budgeted to remain at 1.4 per cent of GDP as in the previous year .
In line with the Indradhanush plan , ₹ 100 billion has been allocated towards recapitalisation of public sector banks ( PSBs ) .
RD and GFD , both in absolute terms as well as per cent of BE , were higher than those in the corresponding quarter of the previous year .
Deterioration in fiscal position was the outcome of lower growth in revenue and higher growth in expenditure .
On the receipts side , growth in tax revenue decelerated sharply on account of a slowdown in all major taxes ( income tax collections , customs duties , excise duty and service tax ) , except corporation tax .
Total expenditure at 30.3 per cent of BE was higher than 25.9 per cent in the corresponding quarter of the previous year due to higher revenue expenditure and a sharp turnaround in the capital account - in conformity with the government ' s intention of front-loading expenditure before the onset of monsoon .
Going ahead , the pickup in capital expenditure augurs well for improvement in expenditure quality .
Available information pertaining to 26 state governments indicates a deterioration in GFD , revenue and primary deficits in 2016-17 ( RE ) vis-a-vis the BE .
The revenue account worsened because of shortfall in revenues and expenditure overshooting .
Compared with the actuals of the previous year , the consolidated GFD increased by 0.4 percentage point to 2.9 per cent of GDP in 2016-17 .
The GFD-GDP ratio of states is budgeted to improve to 2.3 per cent during 2017-18 ( from 2.9 per cent in the RE for 2016-17 ) , largely on the back of a projected rise in tax revenue - both own tax revenue as well as tax devolution - and moderation in revenue expenditure ( Chart II.34 ) .
The revenue account is also expected to post a surplus during the year .
The flexibility for additional borrowings given by the 14 Finance Commission may encourage states to take greater recourse to market borrowings which , in turn , could exert pressure on yields , thereby raising the cost of borrowings .
On the revenue side , the transition to GST may temporarily impact tax receipts , although the proposed compensation clause from the centre may provide some headroom ( see Chapter III of the report on State Finances : A Study of Budgets of 2016-17 ) .
Recent instances of farm loan waivers in India include the Agricultural Debt Waiver and Debt Relief ( ADWDR ) Scheme announced by the central government in 2008 and state- specific farm loan waivers announced by Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in 2014 ; Tamil Nadu in 2016 ; and Uttar Pradesh , Maharashtra , Punjab and Karnataka in 2017 , so far .
While the benefit of debt relief to individual households can be substantial , the merit of unconditional bailouts in improving productivity and enhancing welfare remains debatable .
While it has been argued that debt relief measures improve the productivity of recipient households as high levels of indebtedness distort investment and production decisions , the counter narrative suggests that loan write offs are detrimental to the culture of prudent borrowing and repayment and stigmatise borrowers in default .
The cost of the Scheme was estimated to be about 2717 billion ( RBI 2008 ) .
In June 2016 , the government of Tamil Nadu ordered the waiver of agricultural loans outstanding as at end-March , 2016 from co-operative banks to small and marginal farmers , the cost of which was estimated at around ₹ 60 billion over a 5-year period ending March 2022 .
The budgetary provision for the same in the form of grants amounted to ₹ 18 billion in the revised estimates for 2016-17 and ₹ 18 billion in 2017- 18 - both around 0.1 per cent of Tamil Nadu ' s gross state domestic product ( GSDP ) .
A recent direction by the Madras High Court to the state government to extend the scheme to all farmers would further add to the state ' s fiscal burden .
In April 2017 , Uttar Pradesh ( UP ) announced a farm loan waiver scheme which is expected to benefit small and marginal farmers by writing off their loans of around ₹ 360 billion - around 2.5 per cent of UP ' s GSDP .
Maharashtra has recently announced a loan waiver scheme for farmers ; similarly , Punjab has announced a waiver on crop loans benefitting small and marginal farmers while Karnataka has announced a waiver amounting to ₹ 81.7 billion for farmers availing farm loans from cooperative banks .
First , the benefit of full loan waiver to farmers under the ADWDR of 2008 turned out to be highly skewed and concentrated in states where concentration of land holdings was low on account of land reforms ( Ramakumar 2013 ) .
Moreover , they impact credit discipline , vitiate credit culture and dis-incentivise borrowers to repay loans , thus engendering moral hazard .
Finally , loan waivers could add to the fiscal burden over the medium term as they are essentially a transfer from tax payers to borrowers .
As per initial estimates , the total loan waivers announced during 2017-18 ( upto August 2 , 2017 ) amount around 0.4 per cent of GDP .
Depending on possible cutback under other expenditure heads , this may result in an increase in the consolidated GFD-GDP ratio of states by about 20-40 basis points .
An empirical exercise reveals that such random policy shocks have an enduring impact on market borrowings as evident from past episodes of such waivers .
If overall government borrowings increase , yields on state development loans ( SDL ) may firm up posing higher interest burdens for states in the future .
Concomitantly , they can also crowd out private borrowers as the general cost of borrowings increases with pressure from higher government borrowings on the finite pool of investible resources in the economy .
An empirical exercise indicates that a one percentage point increase in the ratio of state debt issuance to GDP is associated with a decline of 0.067 percentage point in the ratio of corporate bond issuance to total assets of corporates .
Thus , state government farm loan waivers have the potential to crowd out corporate borrowing if financed through state debt issuance .
In order to understand the forces that drive loan waivers and their long term consequences for the entire economy , the Reserve Bank is organising a seminar on ' Agricultural Debt Waiver-Efficacy and Limitations ' on August 31 , 2017 .
The general government GFD is expected to be brought down further to 5.5 per cent of GDP in 2017-18 from 6.4 per cent in the revised estimates for 2016-17 .
Moreover , the debt servicing capacity of the general government has improved over the previous two years ( Chart II.35 ) .
The central government ' s fiscal strategy for 2016-17 was mainly revenue-driven , with buoyant tax collections comfortably funding additional expenditure commitments relating to the implementation of CPC .
At the state level , however , there was a slippage in FD , RD and primary deficit ( PD ) in 2016-17 ( RE ) along with a deterioration in debt position , partly due to their participation in UDAY .
Going forward , GST remains the best bet for states in getting back to the path of fiscal consolidation over the medium term .
The cushion of compensation by the centre for any loss of revenue in the initial five years should safeguard against uncertainty about the revenue outcome from the GST implementation .
India ' s external sector remained resilient in 2016-17 amidst considerable flux in the international environment ;
Shrugging off a two-year contraction , merchandise exports turned around in the face of muted global demand .
This development also assumes significance in view of the decline in net invisible receipts addressed in sub-section 3 .
Consequently , rising international commodity prices and the erosion in terms of trade gains notwithstanding , India ' s merchandise trade deficit narrowed further in 2016-17 and helped compress the current account deficit ( CAD ) as discussed in sub-section 4 .
Sub-section 5 discusses external financing and the predominance of non-debt creating inflows .
Considerable volatility characterised portfolio investment flows against a backdrop of turbulent global financial markets and political risks .
In contrast , direct investment inflows reached an all- time high .
Net outflows were recorded under other major categories of financial flows barring trade credits which picked up in H2 in tandem with import activity .
At the end of March 2017 , India ' s foreign exchange reserves covered for 11.3 months of imports and were the ninth largest in the world .
While the modest recovery in global trade was driven by a pick-up in imports by emerging market economies ( EMEs ) , India ' s export recovery was largely led by shipments to advanced economies ( AEs ) , notwithstanding the persistence of high tariff and non-tariff barriers in major trade partner economies ( Chart II.37 ) .
The upsurge in exports in H2 spanned several commodity groups with a combined weight of 87.5 per cent in the export basket .
The notable drivers were engineering goods , petroleum products , iron ore , cotton yarn , chemicals , marine products , gems and jewellery and readymade garments .
A few of these sectors - petroleum products ; iron ore ; steel ; cotton ; and marine products - benefitted from a surge in international commodity prices .
Exports of iron ore responded to strong demand from China .
Steel exports accelerated sharply on the back of trade remedial measures , and underpinned the performance of engineering goods .
Notwithstanding a transitory stress post-demonetisation , exports of labour intensive sectors such as readymade garments and gems and jewellery , quickly returned to expansion mode .
Export recovery continued in April-June 2017 on the back of robust growth in engineering goods , petroleum products and readymade garments , though at a softer pace than Q4 of 2016-17 .
Imports started picking up from H2 of 2016-17 .
However , they were largely sluggish in 2016-17 , albeit with a marginal increase .
Oil imports , in fact , turned around in 2016-17 in contrast to a large contraction in the previous year .
On the other hand , there was a sharper reduction in gold imports and a slim increase in non-oil non- gold imports ( Chart II.38 ) .
The expansion in the oil import bill occurred on the back of an increase in volume .
The volume of gold imports dipped by about one-fifth over the previous year .
Strikes by jewellers against the one per cent excise duty , cash shortages following demonetisation , the income declaration scheme and high gold prices took their toll translating into a decline of 13.4 per cent in value terms .
Non-oil non-gold imports remained muted for the year as a whole , even though a sharp pick- up was discernible across various commodity groups in H2 ( Chart II.39 ) .
While the pick-up in demand for domestic coal reduced import volumes , the global surge in coal prices led to an increase in value terms .
An uptick in imports of vegetable oil occurred on account of a modest increase in volume ; however , this also reflected the uptrend in international prices .
Imports of pearls and precious stones moved in tandem with higher exports of gems and jewellery .
Import of pulses rose for the third consecutive year despite the highest ever domestic production , reflecting growing consumption and build-up of buffer stocks .
In contrast , a fall in raw material prices encouraged substitution of imports in the case of fertilisers , even though global prices softened sharply .
Anti-dumping and safeguard measures undertaken by the government helped reduce steel imports significantly .
During April-June 2017 , merchandise imports witnessed robust growth .
Net receipts from invisibles , comprising services , income and transfers , declined during 2016-17 mainly due to moderation in software exports , private transfer receipts and higher net outgo on primary incomes ( Chart II.40 ) .
Going forward , global headwinds for domestic software companies may intensify further with emphasis on local hiring , and higher demand for automation across major export markets .
Net travel receipts increased by 5.3 per cent during 2016-17 , as gains from higher tourist arrivals offset the burgeoning demand for travel services by residents .
Under transfers , in- bound remittances to India were dampened for the second successive year by the weakening of growth and labour market " nationalisation " policies that impacted hiring of foreign workers in source countries .
Net outgo with respect to profits and dividends also increased , largely reflecting higher returns that accrued to foreign investors on their investments in the domestic economy .
In the aggregate , the net surplus from invisibles financed 86 per cent of the merchandise trade deficit , up from 83 per cent during the previous year , despite a contraction of 10 per cent during 2016-17 .
The bottoming out of international prices of major commodities in 2016 eroded gains in India ' s terms of trade vis-a-vis the preceding two years ( Chart II.41 ) .
Another downside factor that impacted the current account deficit ( CAD ) was the lower order of net receipts from services and remittances as well as higher outgo on income payments during 2016-17 .
Nevertheless , with the trade deficit shrinking on the back of stronger exports and subdued imports , CAD shrank to 0.7 per cent of GDP in 2016-17 as against 1.1 per cent a year ago ( Chart II.42 ) .
The gains in terms of trade realised in the preceding two years were slightly undermined by a modest upturn in international commodity prices in 2016-17 .
Further , the positive impact of the trade volume also outweighed the negative contribution of software exports and remittances ( Chart II.43 ) .
Sources of Decline in India ' s Current _ Terms of Trade Effect ( Estimated ) Trade Volume Effect ( Estimated ) @ Change in Net Software Exports Change in Exports of Other Services @ Change in Income Payments - Change in CAB Note : Trade Volume effect implies change in CAD on account of volume of exports and imports during the year .
Net capital flows were in excess of CAD , leading to an increase in foreign exchange reserves during 2016-17 to a level of US $ 370 billion by the end of the year ( Chart II.44 ) .
Gross foreign direct investments ( FDI ) to India reached an all-time high of US $ 60 billion in 2016-17 , up from US $ 56 billion a year before .
This jump was catalysed by wide ranging domestic reforms , in particular , easing of FDI norms ; the Goods and Services Tax ; the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 ; the new corporate insolvency framework , including the National Company Law Tribunal and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ; and ease of doing business .
A recent report by FDI Intelligence reveals that India was ahead of China and the US as the world ' s top destination for greenfield FDI in 2016 .
Further , the UNCTAD ' s survey of multinational enterprises ranked India as the third most favourite host country for FDI for 2017-19 after the US and China ( Chart II.45 ) .
Foreign portfolio investment ( FPI ) flows remained volatile throughout the year .
With the recovery in global equity markets on expectations of expanded monetary accommodation from systemic central banks , net FPI inflows were robust up to Q2 .
Subsequently , global risk aversion driven by the outcome for the US Presidential elections and expectations of an increase in the Federal funds rate , culminated in intense selling pressure in domestic equity and debt segments during November 2016 through January 2017 .
FPI flows ( net ) , turned positive once again thereafter - aggregating US $ 23.4 billion during February to end-June 2017 .
Net inflows of short-term trade credit turned positive in H2 of 2016-17 ; this was in line with growing imports .
In 2016-17 , net inflows in the form of trade credit amounted to US $ 6.5 billion as against a net repayment of US $ 1.6 billion in 2015- 16 .
Major sectors that took recourse to trade credit during the year included gold , oil , steel , edible oil and coal .
External commercial borrowings ( ECB ) ( net ) , recorded outflows on higher repayments .
Even though ECB flows to India moderated in 2016-17 , domestic companies took increasing recourse to rupee denominated bonds ( RDBs ) amounting to US $ 3,671 million as compared with US $ 14 million a year ago .
The distribution pattern shows that one-third of the RDBs were raised for repayments of domestic rupee loans .
About 41.0 per cent of the total ECB agreement amount ( other than rupee denominated bonds / loans ) was intended to be hedged as compared to 39.1 per cent a year ago .
Notwithstanding positive accretions of deposits under Non-Resident ( External ) Rupee ( NRE ) accounts ; and Non-Resident Ordinary ( NRO ) accounts , there was a net outflow of US $ 12.4 billion from non-resident deposits during 2016-17 , following a lumpy redemption of FCNR ( B ) deposits raised by banks under the Reserve Bank ' s special swap window during September to November 2013 .
In the run-up to the redemption , the Reserve Bank took up short positions in the forward market for the US dollar , and reversed those positions during the redemption period .
India ' s external debt as at end-March 2017 stood much lower than a year before .
This decline is mainly attributed to the fall in long-term external debt , particularly non-resident deposits reflecting the redemption of FCNR ( B ) deposits and commercial borrowings .
As at end-March 2017 , the share of US dollar denominated debt was 52.1 per cent of the total external debt , followed by the Indian rupee ( 33.6 per cent ) , SDR ( 5.8 per cent ) , Japanese yen ( 4.6 per cent ) , Euro ( 2.9 per cent ) , and others ( 1.0 per cent ) .
India ' s external sector vulnerability indicators are being monitored continuously .
The configuration of a lower CAD , declining external debt , rising foreign exchange reserves and stable domestic fundamentals point towards greater resilience of the external sector in the recent period .
The foreign exchange cover Assessment of India ' s External Sector Resilience India ' s external sector parameters have improved over the last few years drawing strength primarily from a lower current account deficit ( CAD ) .
In general , a lower current account deficit augurs well for lower external financing requirements , build-up of reserves and a stable currency , albeit there could be other factors at play impacting each indicator separately .
For instance , CAD , even if lower , financed through short- term debt may alter the composition of external debt and thus worsen reserve adequacy indicators .
Hence , it is important to examine the external sector ' s resilience in a more holistic manner by simultaneously focusing on key external indicators .
Applying the Classification and Regression Tree Approach ( CART ) adopted by Lauet a / ( 2003 ) , data on five external sector indicators , viz . , export growth , current account balance , net capital flows , reserve adequacy for short- term debt and the net international financial position were converted into probability-weighted " strong " and " weak " signs .
Data points above ( below ) 80 ( 20 ) percentile were assigned a probability of one of being a strong ( weak ) indicator .
Data points within the 20th and 80th percentile were assigned probability depending on their relative closeness to either percentile values .
Then , a decision matrix was drawn up to assign rating scores between 1 ( weak ) and 5 ( strong ) to each of the 32 possible combinations of the " strong " and " weak " signs of the five indicators .
Finally , a fuzzy logic system was applied to the combinations to obtain an overall resilience score in a range of 1 to 5 ( least resilient to most resilient ) for each quarter .
India ' s external sector resilience score improved to 1.89 as at end-March 2017 from 1.54 as at end-March 2013 , i.e. , during the pre-taper talk period .
However , the current resilience score is not only weaker than that of 3.68 at end-September 2008 , i.e. , just before the onset of global financial crisis but also , being closer to the lower end , it signals a general deterioration ( Chart 1 ) .
The resilience score then improved marginally to 1.79 in March 2017 from 1.11 in the pre-taper talk period , but continued to be lower than the peak observed during the pre-global financial crisis period .
However , all indicators except net capital flows / GDP were stronger during Q4 of 2016-17 than during the pre-taper tantrum period , thus translating into a higher resilience score .
If terms of trade gains turn unfavourable in tandem with projected higher international commodity prices and the global demand conditions do not improve enough to support export volumes , CAD could increase due to a widening of the merchandise trade deficit .
In fact , based on data for 1980-2016 , it is estimated that a one per cent positive shock in terms of trade reduces India ' s CAD by 0.03 per cent of GDP .
Secondly , India ' s software exports - a major source of financing merchandise trade deficit , face heightened uncertainty from protectionist policies being envisaged in advanced economies , especially with regard to H1B visa in the US , which may stress the current balance of payment ( BoP ) .
Thirdly , the short-term outlook for remittances flows to India largely depends on income conditions in source countries , especially the Gulf region which is facing low growth and undergoing fiscal consolidation , even though the assessment of the World Bank ( 2017 ) is more optimistic on this count .
Finally , robust FDI inflows which were at the forefront in financing CAD in the previous three years , entail servicing through higher income payments which could have implications for CAD .

World Bank ( 2017 ) , Migration and Development Brief 27 , April .
India ' s net international investment position ( NIIP ) as a ratio to GDP improved , albeit the stock of foreign assets held by domestic residents ( assets ) and domestic assets held by foreign residents ( liabilities ) surged during 2016-17 ( Table II.8 ) .
The share of non-debt liabilities increased to 50.3 per cent as at end-March 2017 from 46.3 per cent a year ago .
Tosum up , India ' s external sector benefited from lower CAD , robust FDI inflows , build-up of reserves and improvement in other vulnerability indicators .
However , global factors continue to weigh on India ' s external sector outlook .
In particular , developments in the global oil market will have implications for India ' s oil import bill .
Further , India ' s IT sector could face a challenging business environment from policy changes in the US which can affect its export potential .
However , domestic macroeconomic fundamentals continue to remain strong , rendering the external sector resilient to global shocks .
While the monetary policy objective of price stability has been explicitly specified in terms of the commitment to meet the inflation target based on the headline Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) , the factors that constitute a failure to achieve the inflation target , / .e. , if the average inflation is more ( less ) than the upper ( lower ) tolerance level for three consecutive quarters , have also been defined and notified in the official Gazette .
To operationalise this mandate , the Government , on August 5 , 2016 , notified the inflation target as four per cent year-on-year growth in CPl-Combined inflation , with upper and lower tolerance levels of six per cent and two per cent , respectively .
The amended RBI Act also provided for the constitution of a six member MPC .
As per the amended RBI Act , the MPC would be entrusted with the task of fixing the benchmark policy rate ( repo rate ) required to contain inflation within the specified target level .
Out of the six members of the MPC , three members would be from the Reserve Bank and the other three members would be appointed by the central government .
The three external members would hold office for a period of four years .
The MPC is stipulated to hold meetings at least four times a year .
To ensure transparency of the MPC proceedings , the amended RBI Act prescribes for attributing the vote of each member of the MPC .
It also requires each member of the MPC to write a statement specifying the reasons for voting in favour of , or against the proposed resolution .
At the end of each meeting , the MPC would publish the resolution adopted by the Committee .
On the fourteenth day after every meeting of the MPC , the minutes of the meeting containing the resolution adopted at the meeting of the MPC , the vote of each member of the MPC ascribed to such member , and the statement of each member of the MPC are required to be put out in the public domain .
In the case of failure to meet the target , wherein the average inflation remains more ( less ) than the upper ( lower ) tolerance level of the inflation target for any three consecutive quarters , the Reserve Bank would have to explain in a report to the central government setting out the reasons for failure to achieve the inflation target ; the remedial actions proposed to be taken by the Reserve Bank ; and an estimate of the time period within which the inflation target would be achieved .
Further , uncertainty on trajectory of inflation excluding food and fuel arose from the possibility of higher input price pressures and whether the then benign movement in crude prices would turn out to be transient , feeding to output prices as output gap continued to close .
An upturn in inflation excluding food and fuel on account of these factors , possibly even counterbalancing the benefit of the expected easing of food inflation , was also highlighted by the policy statement .
However , the monetary policy stance continued to be accommodative with emphasis on pro-active liquidity management to enable faster pass-through of the past policy rate cuts to the banks ' MCLRs .
Observing that space had opened up by the moderating trajectory of inflation , underpinned by the supply side measures taken by the Government , the MPC unanimously voted for a reduction in the key policy rate by 25 bps .
The steady improvement in liquidity conditions from deficit at the beginning of the year to surplus by July 2016 , under the modified liquidity management framework , helped transmit the policy rate reduction to various segments of the market .
The MPC assessed that inflation would remain within 5 per cent by Q4 of 2016-17 , though potential cost- push pressures , including the impending 7 CPC ' s award on house rent allowances , and the increase in minimum wages with potential spillovers to minimum support prices , were flagged as upside risks to inflation .
The MPC ' s meeting of December 6 and statement was overcast by heightened uncertainty around the outlook for growth and inflation in the aftermath of demonetisation .
In the MPC ' s view , short-run disruptions in economic activity in cash- intensive sectors were likely to be transitory , given the war-time drive launched by the Reserve Bank to restore the pre-demonetisation stock of currency in circulation by ramping up the circulation of new currency notes , alongside the greater usage of non-cash based payment instruments in the economy .
The large surplus liquidity following the demonetisation in November 2016 , was also considered transitory in view of liquidity management operations targeted at restoring system-level liquidity to a position closer to neutrality .
Accordingly , the MPC unanimously decided to keep policy repo rate unchanged , while continuing with an accommodative policy stance .
In the sixth bi-monthly monetary policy that growth would recover sharply in 2017-18 on account of the following factors : ( i ) a resurgence of discretionary consumer demand , held back by demonetisation ; ( ii ) quick revival of economic activity in cash-intensive sectors ; ( iii ) pick-up in both consumption and investment demand as the demonetisation-induced ease in bank funding conditions leads to a sharp improvement in transmission of past policy rate reductions into MCLRs , and in turn , to lending rates for healthy borrowers ; and ( iv ) the positive impact on growth of measures announced in the Union Budget for 2017-18 to step up capital expenditure , boost the rural economy and affordable housing .
The MPC reiterated its commitment to bring headline inflation closer to 4.0 per cent on a durable basis andinacalibrated manner , noting that this required further significant decline in inflation expectations .
While observing that the persistence of inflation excluding food and fuel could set a floor on further downward movements in headline inflation and trigger second-order effects , the MPC indicated that it needed more time to assess the manner in which the transitory effects of demonetisation on inflation and the output gap could play out .
The committee decided to change the policy stance from accommodative to neutral while keeping the policy rate on hold .
The headline inflation target of 5.0 per cent for Q4 of 2016-17 undershot by around 140 bps largely driven by deflation in pulses and vegetables .
The sustained decline in food prices since August 2016 has been unprecedented by historical patterns .
The initial drop in food prices was driven by correction in prices of pulses and vegetables in response to supply management measures .
Since November , collapse in vegetable prices across the board was driven by demand compression and fire sales of vegetables post demonetisation in a scenario of high seasonal supply .
While the sharp decline in vegetable prices was expected to be transitory as effects of demonetisation fade , there was considerable uncertainty on the timing and the strength of the expected reversal , especially during the summer months .
Pulses were expected to remain soft on the back of a sharp rise in production and imports .
The statement observed that although CPI headline inflation fell to the then historic low in January 2017 due to sharp moderation in food inflation , inflation excluding food and fuel had remained relatively sticky since September 2016 and was significantly above the headline inflation .
Though inflation was projected to be moderate in the first half of the year , significant upside risks remained in the form of uncertainty of monsoon , implementation of allowances under the 7 CPC even as moderation in crude prices and softening of food prices could help contain inflation impulses .
Growth was projected to strengthen to 7.4 per cent in 2017-18 from 6.7 per cent in 2016-17 .
As the output gap could gradually close , aggregate demand pressures would build up , with implications for the inflation trajectory , which was projected to move up in the second half of the year .
In this context , the MPC noted that the future course of monetary policy would largely depend on incoming data and evolving macroeconomic conditions and underlined the need to closely and continuously monitor inflation developments .
The second bi-monthly monetary policy overshadowed by inflation falling below 4.0 per cent in May 2017.While reiterating its commitment to keep headline inflation close to 4.0 per cent on a durable basis , the MPC took cognizance of the unusual softening of headline inflation on account of the sharp moderation in food inflation .
The Committee noted that the risk of fiscal slippages , which , by and large , could entail inflationary spillovers , had risen with the announcements of large farm loan waivers .
This along with the global , political and financial risks materialising into imported inflation and the disbursement of allowances under the 7 CPC ' s award would be the upside risks .
Given , however , the uncertainty surrounding the evolving inflation trajectory , especially for the near months , the MPC was of the view that premature monetary policy responses risk disruptive policy reversals later and the loss of credibility .
The MPC ' s resolution underlined the need to revive private investment , restore banking sector health and remove infrastructural bottlenecks for monetary policy to play an effective role .
Accordingly , the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.25 per cent with a neutral stance while remaining watchful of the incoming data .
The operating framework of monetary policy aims at aligning the operating target - the weighted average call rate ( WACR ) - with the policy repo rate through proactive liquidity management consistent with the stance of monetary policy .
Liquidity management during 2016-17 can be heuristically categorised into two distinct phases .
First , active operations were launched to progressively move the ex-ante liquidity position in the system from deficit to closer to neutrality .
Second , managing the post-demonetisation surge in surplus liquidity became an overriding priority , warranting unorthodox instruments to augment the arsenal of regular operations so as to prevent excessive softening of money market rates under the weight of the deluge of liquidity .
The liquidity management framework was modified in April 2016 in the first phase .
The Reserve Bank proactively injected durable liquidity of ₹ 2.1 trillion during the year up to November 8 , 2016 ( i.e. , the pre-demonetisation period ) in the form of open market purchase operations , net forex market operations , and buyback of government securities .
As a result , the system level ex-ante liquidity position transited from a deficit of about ₹ 813 billion , on a daily average basis , in Q1 toa surplus of ₹ 292 billion in Q2 and ₹ 64 billion in Q3 ( up to November 8 , 2016 ) .
Two other changes under the modified liquidity management framework worked in combination to tightly anchor money market rates with the policy rate .
First , the cash reserve ratio ( CRR ) maintenance requirement was reduced to a daily minimum of 90 per cent from 95 per cent earlier , which moderated banks ' holdings of excess reserves .
This narrowed the spread of WACR vis-a- vis the repo rate and reduced its volatility .
As a result , liquidity turned into surplus even prior to the announcement of demonetisation on November 8 , 2016 .
With regard to the unprecedented surge of surplus liquidity created by demonetisation , a mix of instruments was employed by the Reserve Bank at different points in time ( Chart III.3 ) .
Each instrument has distinct advantages and disadvantages ( Table III.1 ) .
After demonetisation , currency in circulation declined by about ₹ 8,997 billion ( up to January 6 , 2017 ) , which resulted in a large increase in surplus liquidity with the banking system , equivalent to a cut in the CRR by about 9 per cent .
This , in turn , posed a formidable challenge to the Reserve Bank ' s liquidity management operations .
This is a market based instrument and suitable for absorbing liquidity for a longer period relative to reverse repos under the LAF .
Market participants prefer this instrument vis-a-vis reverse repo because of liquidity of the underlying instrument .
Key market based indirect instrument for absorbing durable surplus liquidity ; most effective indirect instrument .
Provide flexibility in terms of responding to fast changing liquidity conditions on a daily basis ; rollover option ; simultaneous auctions of multiple tenor ; can aid the development of the term money market .
As there is no limit on the amount that could be parked , it prevents WACR falling below the lower bound of the corridor .
Unremunerated and therefore a cost to the banking system ; not a market based instrument .
Requires timely consent of the Government of India .
Can bid up yields due to repetitive auctions .
Requires adequate stock of domestic securities in the portfolio of the Reserve Bank ; large scale operations can potentially influence yields that may not be consistent with the stance of monetary policy .
Inadequate market appetite for longer-term auctions ; may not prevent significant easing of WACR under persistently high surplus liquidity conditions ; domestic securities available with the Reserve Bank can limit the use of term reverse repo .
Not suitable for dealing with large durable surplus ; most effective not in isolation but when used in conjunction with other instruments .
Extensive use can lead to excessive easing of the WACR relative to the repo rate within the LAF corridor ; domestic securities available with the Reserve Bank can limit the amount of absorption ; can lead to ' lazy ' liquidity management by banks and thus effectively shift the money market on to the Reserve Bank ' s balance sheet .
Second , the Government was requested to enhance the limit of securities issuable under the market stabilisation scheme ( MSS ) to ₹ 6,000 billion from ₹ 300 billion .
The ICRR was withdrawn after the Reserve Bank ' s capacity to auction securities expanded under the enhanced MSS limit .
With fast paced remonetisation , surplus liquidity in the system declined by mid-January 2017 .
The post-demonetisation period has had five different phases of liquidity management ( Chart III.3 ) .
In the first phase ( November 10 to November 25 , 2016 ) , the Reserve Bank extensively used variable rate reverse repos of tenors ranging from overnight up to 91 days .
The outstanding amount of surplus liquidity absorbed through reverse repos ( both variable rate and fixed rate auctions ) reached a peak of ₹ 5,242 billion on November 25 .
In the second phase ( November 26 to December 9 , 2016 ) , 100 per cent ICRR was applied , which helped drain excess liquidity in the system to the extent of about ₹ 4,000 billion .
In the third phase ( December 10 , 2016 to January 13 , 2017 ) , the surplus liquidity was managed through a mix of reverse repos and issuances of CMBs under the MSS , with a gradually increased reliance on the latter .
In the fourth phase ( January 14 to end- March 2017 ) , the Reserve Bank returned to the conventional reverse repo operations as the key instrument to absorb surplus liquidity , particularly the liquidity released through the maturing CMBs under the MSS .
The usual year-end liquidity pressure stemming from banks ' balance sheet adjustments and tax payments to the government did not lead to a very sharp spike in money market rates this time around due to the large post-demonetisation liquidity overhang .
The absorption of liquidity surplus using reverse repos ( at both fixed and variable rates ) peaked at ₹ 5,522 billion on March 6 , 2017 .
The surplus liquidity conditions continued in March , but net absorption of liquidity under the LAF declined to ₹ 3,141 billion by end-March , reflecting the build-up of cash balances by the Government and higher excess CRR maintained by banks .
In the fifth phase that began in April 2017 with the first auction of Treasury Bills ( T-Bills ) under the MSS , surplus liquidity was managed with a mix of issuance of T-Bills under the MSS and reverse repo auctions .
The Reserve Bank auctioned T-Bills ( tenors ranging from 312 days to 329 days ) aggregating 1 trillion in April and May 11.29 The WACR - the operating target of monetary policy - traded at only about 15 basis points ( bps ) below the repo rate between about 27 bps below the repo rate on daily average basis between January 14 and March 31 , 2017 .
While the WACR remained within the LAF corridor , the large deviation of the WACR from the policy repo rate during Q4 was mainly on account of exclusive reliance on reverse repos to absorb surplus liquidity arising out of maturing CMBs ( Chart III.4 ) .
The Reserve Bank reduced the policy repo rate by a cumulative 175 bps during January 2015 to June 2017 .
In response , banks reduced their weighted average domestic term deposit rate ( WADTDR ) by 126 bps during January 2015 to October 2016 .
The weighted average lending rate ( WALR ) on fresh rupee loans and outstanding rupee loans declined by 97 bps and 75 bps , respectively , during the same period .
The reduction in the WADTDR was significantly higher than that in the lending rates ( Table III.2 ) .
Monetary transmission , however , improved significantly post-demonetisation .
Buoyed by the surplus liquidity , the share of current account and saving account ( CASA ) deposits in aggregate deposits increased to 40.6 per cent as at end- March 2017 from 35.2 per cent at end-October 2016 , before declining to 38.6 per cent on June 23 , 2017 .
As the cost of CASA deposits ( 3.2 per cent ) is significantly lower than the WADTDR , , the overall cost of borrowings declined , enabling banks to cut their lending rates .
The largest reduction in MCLR _ post-demonetisation was effected by public sector banks , followed by private sector banks and foreign banks ( Chart III.5 ) .
Transmission was asymmetric across sectors , reflecting varied credit conditions and risk appetite .
Since January 2015 , lending rates across sectors , barring credit card segment , declined in the range of 15-238 bps , with the largest transmission taking place in the case of Rupee export credit ( Table III.4 ) .
Interest rates on fresh rupee loans declined significantly in respect of housing in personal loan segment and vehicle loans in the commercial segment during January 2015 to June 2017 ( Table III.5 ) .
The pace of transmission to lending rates was significantly slower than to deposit rates and the MCLR on account of several factors .
Fourth , the higher lending spread maintained by banks in the wake of stressed asset quality of banks impeded transmission ( Box Ill.1 ) .
This is because banks often adjust the spread they charge over MCLR - both in respect of the outstanding rupee loans and fresh rupee loans sanctioned by banks ( Chart 1 ) .
An inter-sectoral comparison reveals that the spread between WALR and 1-year median MCLR increased across most sectors during 2016-17 ( Table 1 ) .
The coefficient of stressed assets in respect of public and private sector banks is positive but statistically insignificant ( Table 2 ) .
The agenda for 2017-18 will be guided by the mandate as enshrined in the RBI Act , 1934 " to maintain price stability , while keeping in mind the objective of growth . "
The key agenda for 2017-18 , therefore , will focus on studying those aspects , which may have a significant bearing on inflation projections going forward .
This will include : ( i ) examining the impact of implementation of the 7 CPC ' s award on inflation ; ( ii ) assessing the impact of GST on inflation ; ( iii ) analysing the impact of farm loan waivers on the fiscal situation and inflation ; and ( iv ) assessing the output gap position incorporating financial conditions and infrastructure constraints .
The agenda will also include studies on inflation such as : ( i ) a reassessment of the Phillips curve relationship in India ; ( ii ) an analysis of food inflation in the recent period - particularly in terms of behaviour of perishables ; and ( iii ) an assessment of exchange rate pass-through .
Data suggest that investment has remained depressed despite significant monetary easing and pass-through of such easing to bank lending rates .
The MCLR introduced in April 2016 has not performed as expected .
Although the introduction of MCLR resulted in better transparency on fixing of lending rates by banks vis-a-vis the base rate system , banks have frequently adjusted the spreads , thereby impeding transmission to the actual lending rates .
A detailed inter- departmental study will be conducted to examine various aspects of MCLR with a view to bringing necessary refinements and exploring market rates as alternative benchmarks .
An effective monetary transmission is the key to successful implementation of monetary policy .
As surplus liquidity is expected to pose a challenge , especially in the first half of 2017- 18 , the Reserve Bank will endeavour to manage liquidity using multiple instruments available at its disposal .
However , the use of any particular instrument will be situation-specific with the sole objective of ensuring closer alignment of the operating target to the policy repo rate .
The Financial Inclusion Advisory Committee ( FIAC ) which is tasked with the preparation of the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion ( NSFI ) deliberated extensively on its formulation , while also drawing upon international best practices on digital financial inclusion .
Priority sector lending aims to ensure adequate and timely availability of credit for those vulnerable sections of society which are often deprived of credit due to the perceived lack of viability and creditworthiness .
An important development during 2016- 17 was the operationalisation of priority sector lending certificates ( PSLCs ) scheme in April 2016 .
The PSLC _ platform recorded active participation from all the eligible entities including urban co-operative banks and small finance banks during 2016-17 .
Among the four PSLC categories , the highest trading was observed in case of PSLC - Small & Marginal Farmer , and PSLC - General Categories , with the transaction volumes being ₹ 229.9 billion and ₹ 200.2 billion , respectively .
An expected cyclical trend , however , was observed in the trading volume , which peaked mostly in the last month of every quarter .
In view of the introduction of quarterly monitoring of priority sector targets , the timing of the transactions in the earlier or later part of the year also had an impact on the premium .
Accordingly , PSLCs traded during the first quarter of 2016-17 witnessed higher premiums in the range of 3-5 per cent .
The total volume of PSLCs on offer was ₹ 1,265.5 billion , while the amount finally settled was ₹ 498.0 billion as on March 31 , 2017 .
This indicates that with better information dissemination and increased awareness among all the eligible participants , the PSLC market is expected to pick-up in the future , which should lead to higher margins for all PSLC sellers , incentivising increased lending to the priority sector .
The Government has been fixing the target for agricultural credit every year .
During 2016-17 , commercial banks over achieved the target by 28.0 per cent .
All other bank groups under-performed in achieving their targets for agricultural credit though the overall flow of credit had exceeded the target as in the previous year ( Table IV.2 ) .
The Government took several initiatives related to the MSME sector as it plays a crucial role in the economy both from the point of view of its employment generation and poverty alleviation potential .
Continuing in this direction , the Reserve Bank launched Version 2 of NAMCABS by employing newer and more comprehensive training material covering the latest developments in the sector and providing professional advice to MSME entrepreneurs in the form of credit counsellors .
In August 2015 , banks were advised to incorporate with their Boards ' approval , a clause for fixing a separate additional limit in their lending policy to MSEs , at the time of sanction / renewal of working capital limits , specifically for meeting the temporary increase in working capital requirements arising mainly due to unforeseen / seasonal increase in demand for products produced by them .
Credit counsellors were to also assist MSMEs in preparing project reports in a professional manner which would , in turn , help banks make more informed credit decisions .
Accordingly , the Reserve Bank finalised a framework for accreditation of credit counsellors and the same was provided to Small Industries Development Bank of India ( SIDBI ) for rolling out the certified credit counsellors scheme by acting as their registering authority .
SIDBI , after finalising the board-approved operational guidelines , launched the scheme in July 2017 .
Credit flow to the MSE sector is reflective of these measures taken by the Reserve Bank during the year and several Government initiatives undertaken during the past few years ( Table IV.3 ) .
The report is under finalisation .
The Reserve Bank also conducted an impact assessment survey , modelled on a randomised control trial ( RCT ) basis , with the completion of a year of conducting the NAMCABS workshops for the branch managers of the specialised MSME branches through its select nine regional offices .
The survey revealed that the branches with trained personnel generally outperformed those with untrained ones , especially in lending to micro enterprises .
It was , therefore , decided to continue with an enhanced and comprehensive capacity building programme as NAMCABS Version 2 by incorporating , inter-alia , newer developments in terms of government initiatives , Reserve Bank policy initiatives and use of technology in MSME financing .
The Reserve Bank continued with its efforts towards fulfilling the financial inclusion agenda during the year to help realise the intended economic and social objectives .
In this direction , several new initiatives were undertaken during the year .
The Committee on Medium-term Path on Financial Inclusion , which submitted its report in December 2015 , sought to propel the economy on to a medium-term sustainable inclusion path .
The Committee had recommended for setting up a framework for a BC registry and BC certification , following which instructions regarding the same were issued to Indian Banks ' Association ( IBA ) during the year .
As recommended by the Committee , a financial literacy week was conducted across the country from June 5-9 , 2017 .
The literacy week focussed on four broad themes , viz . , Know Your Customer ( KYC ) , Exercising Credit Discipline , Grievance Redressal and Going Digital ( UPI and * 99 # ) .
During the week , banks were advised to display posters on the four common themes inside branch premises and also display one message each day on the homepage of their respective websites as well as ATM screens across the country .
Further , Financial Literacy Centres ( FLCs ) and rural branches were advised to conduct special camps during the week .
A movable asset registry was also launched by the Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest of India ( CERSAI ) , as recommended by the Committee to facilitate lending to the MSME sector .
Strengthening the BC model has been one of the important development agendas , recognising the significant role played by BCs in providing last mile financial services in the under- banked and unbanked regions of the country .
Having a BC registry and certification process in place would go a long way in strengthening the BC model .
A BC registry is proposed to be structured as a database of comprehensive information pertaining to the existing or potential business correspondents .
The BC registry will give a holistic view of under-banked and less penetrated areas in a region and accordingly the delivery of financial services can be improved in such areas through appropriate policy interventions .
It will help in effective monitoring and oversight of BC operations .
It is expected that banks and the regulators would utilise this database to gather critical insights and frame policies accordingly for strengthening the BC infrastructure .
The Reserve Bank has developed the framework for the BC registry and IBA is in the process of setting up the online registry portal .
As the customers served by the BCs are usually new to the formal financial system , it is essential to have knowledgeable business correspondents .
Thus , a need was recognised to upgrade the skill sets of the BC agents thereby making them more sensitive towards the requirements of various customer groups who use the BC channel , viz . , small and marginal farmers , SHGs , micro , medium and small entrepreneurs , migrant labourers and retired people .
Accordingly , the Reserve Bank has developed a framework for BC certification with basic and advanced level courses to enhance the functional and behavioural competencies of BCs .
On the basis of this framework , IBA has set up a Governing Council comprising members each from IBA , NABARD , two members each from academics and experts from industry .
The Council is in the process of developing the course curriculum .
The Plans capture self-set targets of the banks on parameters such as the number of outlets ( branches and BCs ) , Basic Savings Bank Deposit Accounts ( BSBDAs ) opened by bank branches and BCs , overdraft facilities availed in those accounts , transactions in Kisan Credit Card ( KCC ) , General Credit Card ( GCC ) accounts and transactions through the BC-ICT channel .
During 2016-17 , the banking outlets opened through BCs in villages increased by 12,243 , while the number of accounts opened through BCs increased by 49 million .
Similarly , the total number of transactions through the BC channel increased by 332 million , while the amount transacted increased by ₹ 965 billion .
With the conclusion of the second phase commercial banks ( including RRBs ) were advised to set new Board approved FIP targets for the next three years ( April 2016-March 2019 ) .
Recognising the importance of granular data for effective monitoring of the progress made by banks , the third phase FIP template has been revised incorporating new parameters keeping in view the emerging financial inclusion landscape .
In this phase , banks have been asked to provide data up to the district level across population groups of metro , urban , semi-urban and rural segments .
Work is also underway for the formulation of a National Strategy for Financial Inclusion ( NSFI ) ( Box IV.1 ) .
National Strategy for Financial Inclusion The Reserve Bank had set up the Financial Inclusion Advisory Committee ( FIAC ) in 2012 to review financial inclusion policies on an on-going basis and to provide expert advice to the Reserve Bank in this matter .
Given the renewed focus on financial inclusion by the Government of India , the on-going implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana ( PMJDY ) and the need for convergence of the financial inclusion efforts of various stakeholders , FIAC was reconstituted in June 2015 .
Apart from continuous reviewing of the financial inclusion policy , monitoring the progress of financial inclusion and financial literacy , and assessing their impact , the reconstituted FIAC has been actively involved in the process of formulating the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion ( NSFI ) , a public document .
NSFI will comprehensively present the strategy developed at the national level to systematically accelerate the level of financial inclusion .
The Reserve Bank had taken several steps to provide banking facilities in all the unbanked villages in the country .
A roadmap to cover villages with population more than 2,000 was first rolled out in 2010 .
A total of 74,414 villages with population more than 2,000 were identified and allotted to various banks ( public sector banks , private sector banks and regional rural banks ) through State Level Bankers ' Committees ( SLBCs ) for coverage .
All the identified villages have been provided banking services through branches or business correspondents or through other modes such as ATMs and mobile vans .
In June 2012 , a roadmap was rolled out to provide banking services to unbanked villages with population less than 2,000 .
A total of 491,825 unbanked villages across the country with a population of less than 2,000 were allotted to various banks through SLBCs
The proposed strategy pillars for NSFI include : developing physical and digital infrastructure , regulatory framework , fostering competition , increased financial awareness , grievance redressal mechanism and scientific assessment measures .
Given the recent thrust on digital financial inclusion and in line with international best practices , NSFI also seeks to draw upon the G-20 High Level Principles on Digital Financial Inclusion , adapted to meet the India-specific requirements .
On May 18 , 2017 , the Reserve Bank issued revised guidelines on branch authorisation policy with a view to facilitate financial inclusion as also to provide flexibility to banks on the choice of delivery channel .
Accordingly , SLBC convenor banks have been advised to review and identify the unbanked rural centres ( URCs ) in villages with population above 5,000 and ensure that such unbanked rural centres are banked forthwith by opening of CBS enabled banking outlets by December 31 , 2017 .
In view of the merger of State Bank of Hyderabad with State Bank of India , the SLBC Convenorship of Telangana has been assigned to the State Bank of India .
During the year , 21 new districts were formed in Telangana , taking the total number of districts in the State to 31 .
In Manipur , seven new districts were formed taking the total number of districts in the State to 16 .
United Bank of India and State Bank of India were assigned lead bank responsibility of the new districts .
In Haryana and West Bengal , one new district each was created and Punjab National Bank and State Bank of India were assigned lead bank responsibility of the new districts , respectively .
Lead bank responsibility of the three newly created districts in Arunachal Pradesh was assigned to the State Bank of India .
Further , in view of the merger of Associate Banks with the State Bank of India , the lead bank responsibility of districts hitherto held by the Associate Banks in the states of Karnataka , Kerala , Rajasthan , Telangana and Punjab have been assigned to State Bank of India .
As on June 2017 , lead bank responsibility has been assigned in 706 districts across the country .
Financial literacy has been an important element in the financial inclusion plan of the Reserve Bank .
During 2016-17 , added importance was attached to spreading financial literacy , given the skewed distribution and limited reach of financial literacy centres in some states as well as in view of the withdrawal of legal tender status of SBNs and the push for digital transactions .
Following withdrawal of legal tender status of SBNs , the policy on conduct of camps by FLCs and rural branches of banks was reviewed with a focus on going digital .
Accordingly , banks were advised to conduct special camps through their FLCs ( 2 camps per month ) for a period of one year on ' Going Digital ' through UPI and * 99 # ( USSD ) .
Two posters on UPI and * 99 # have been prepared for this purpose .
The Financial Awareness Messages ( FAME ) booklet that contains 11 institution- neutral financial awareness messages has been published in 13 languages for the benefit of the trainers and the camp participants .
Rural branches of banks are required to conduct one camp per month covering all the messages that are part of the FAME booklet and the two digital platforms UPI and * 99 # ( USSD ) .
A _ two-tier training programme has been designed for the capacity building of FLC counsellors and rural branch managers .
During Tier-1 of the program , CLOs ( Chief Literacy Officer attached to the corporate office of the banks ) , LLOs ( Lead Literacy Officers - faculty members of the Banks ' training / staff colleges ) and RLOs ( Regional Office Literacy Officers from regional offices of the Reserve Bank ) have been trained at CAB , Pune .
The survey was conducted in 29 states and 5 union territories ( excluding Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep Islands ) .
Quotas for age , gender and socio economic classes were fixed across the locations to achieve a representative sample .
The total sample size for the survey was 20,573 respondents .
As per the OECD / INFE methodology , financial literacy is measured across three components viz. financial knowledge , attitude , and behaviour .
Questions on financial knowledge test the concepts of time value of money , calculation of interest , compounding , definition of inflation , risk and return , and diversification .
Financial attitude captures the trade- off between short term gratification ( consumption ) and long term planning ( saving ) .
Financial behaviour questions are designed to test decision making in the household , budgeting , active saving , considered purchasing , paying bills on time and choosing financial products .
A comprehensive curriculum on the core competencies of financial literacy has been prepared for the benefit of the trainers .
OECD / INFE considers the threshold score as 5 out of 7 for financial knowledge , 3 out of 5 for financial attitude , and 6 out of 9 for financial behaviour .
The percentage of Indian population scoring above the minimum required threshold score is 32 per cent for financial knowledge , 28 per cent for financial attitude , and 56 per cent for financial behaviour .
The results of the survey are presented in the chart below .
To explore innovative and participatory approaches to financial literacy , the Reserve Bank is initiating a pilot project on financial literacy at the block level .
The pilot project is being commissioned in nine states across 80 blocks by NGOs in collaboration with the sponsor banks .
Six NGOs registered with the Depositors Education and Awareness Fund ( DEA Fund ) viz . , CRISIL Foundation , Dhan Foundation , Swadhaar FinAccess , Indian School of Micro Finance for Women ( ISMW ) , Samarpit and PACE Foundation have been selected to execute the pilot project in collaboration with the banks .
The pilot project will be executed with the objectives of active saving and good borrowing , financial planning and goal setting , going digital and consumer protection .
CFLs would be set up under a common name and logo " Moneywise Centre for Financial Literacy . "
Going forward , work related to the preparation of National Strategy for Financial Inclusion , which will comprehensively lay down the policy approach to hasten the process of financial inclusion , will be completed .
Financial literacy content for certain target groups like SHGs , farmers , MSEs , students and senior citizens will be introduced .
The block level CFLs are expected to begin financial literacy activities in 2017-18 , following which an independent impact assessment study would be conducted by the Reserve Bank .
Gilt account holders ( GAHs ) were permitted to enter into a repo transaction with their custodians or with another GAH .
Further , in August 2016 , brokers undertaking market-making activities in corporate bonds were permitted access to corporate bond repo market to meet their liquidity requirement .
In order to stimulate retail participation in the G-sec market , an implementation group with representation from all stakeholders was constituted to recommend specific measures to enable seamless movement of securities from the Subsidiary General Ledger ( SGL ) form to demat form and vice versa and to provide demat account holders a functionality to put through trades on NDS-OM .
Accordingly , demat account holders of National Securities Depository Limited ( NSDL ) and Central Depository Services Limited ( CDSL ) were permitted from August 2016 to put through trades in G-sec on the NDS-OM platform through their respective Depository Participant ( DP ) bank which should also be an SGL account holder and a direct member of NDS-OM and the Clearing Corporation of India Limited ( CCIL ) .
Existing directions on commercial paper ( CP ) were reviewed with a view to broadening access to it , strengthening disclosure requirements by issuers , and reviewing the role of issuing and paying agents while putting in place an information dissemination mechanism , and revised draft directions were placed on the Bank ' s website for public comments .
The final directions were issued on August 10 , 2017 .
Draft directions on the introduction of tri- party repo were placed on the Bank ' s website in April 2017 for public comments , with the objective of enabling market participants to use the underlying collateral more efficiently and to facilitate the development of term repo market .
Taking into account the feedback received from the market , final directions were issued on August 10 , 2017 .
With a view to providing operational flexibility to multinational entities and their Indian subsidiaries exposed to currency risk , the non- resident centralised or regional treasury of such entities was permitted in March 2017 to enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts with authorised dealer ( AD ) banks in India to hedge the exposure of their Indian subsidiaries by entering into tri-partite agreement involving the Indian subsidiary , its non-resident parent or treasury and the AD bank .
Initiatives currently under consideration include a framework for authorisation of trading platform for OTC markets under the Reserve Bank ' s ambit , introduction of a comprehensive code of fair practices for debt market in line with global standards and framing of guidelines on financial markets in the International Financial Service Centre ( IFSC ) , viz . , Gujarat International Finance Tec-City ( GIFT ) .
Draft guidelines for simplified hedging facility for residents and non-residents were released in April 2017 for comments and feedback from the stakeholders .
To begin with , entities with forex exposure of up to US $ 30 million would be permitted under the facility .
In fulfilment of the G20 mandate for shifting OTC derivatives on to exchanges or electronic trading platforms , a framework for authorisation of such platforms would be put in place .
The implementation of the legal entity identifier ( LEl ) regime for financial market entities would begin during the year .
FMOD is entrusted with the responsibility of conducting liquidity management operations for maintaining appropriate level of liquidity in the financial system for monetary transmission .
It also works towards ensuring that orderly conditions are maintained in the forex market through operations in the spot , forward and futures segments .
The department continued its efforts to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity in the financial system through liquidity management operations , using fixed and variable rate repo and reverse repo under the liquidity adjustment facility ( LAF ) , the marginal standing facility ( MSF ) and outright open market operations ( OMOs ) , with a view to aligning money market rates with the policy rate for more efficient transmission of monetary policy signals .
In line with the change in the monetary policy stance from a deficit to a position close to neutrality , as enunciated in the monetary policy statement of April 05 , 2016 , the department conducted nine OMO purchase auctions during April-October 2016 , injecting liquidity amounting to ₹ 1.1 trillion into the banking system .
This was a temporary measure and was withdrawn from the next fortnight , / .e. , the fortnight surplus was also managed through ( 1 ) issuance of cash management bills ( CMBs ) under the market stabilisation scheme ( MSS ) , which touched a peak outstanding level at ₹ 5,966 billion during the first half of January 2017 ; and ( 2 ) undertaking multi- tenor variable rate reverse repos .
The liquidity absorbed by the Reserve Bank ( including through MSS ) during this period touched a high of ₹ 7,956 billion on January 04 , 2017 .
The department also introduced measures to facilitate the development of the term money market that included security substitution , market-based valuation of collateral securities in LAF operations and re-repo of collateral received by market participants under term reverse repo with the Reserve Bank .
Orderly conditions were maintained in the forex market during the year through operations in the spot , forward and futures segments .
The Reserve Bank ' s foreign exchange market operations , aimed at containing excessive volatility and maintaining orderly conditions in the forex market , resulted in net purchase of foreign currency amounting to US $ 12.3 billion during 2016-17 ( US $ 10.2 billion in 2015-16 ) and US $ 8.9 billion during April-June 2017 .
Outstanding net forward purchases , which stood at US $ 10.8 billion as at end-March 2017 , increased to US $ 17.1 billion at end-June 2017 .
India ' s foreign exchange reserves increased to US $ 386.54 billion as at end-June 2017 from US $ 360.18 billion as at end- March 2016 .
During 2016-17 , there was smooth unwinding of concessional foreign exchange swaps undertaken by market participants with the Reserve Bank in 2013 .
These concessional swaps were executed against foreign currency non- resident ( bank ) [ FCNR ( B ) ] deposits maturing from September 2016 onwards .
Some of the outflows also pertained to concessional swaps against overseas foreign currency borrowings ( OFCBs ) of banks .
The Reserve Bank ' s forward forex assets were consciously matched with the FCNR ( B ) and OFCB liabilities .
This helped avoid a sharp fall in the foreign exchange reserves and also neutralised the impact on liquidity which was also managed by appropriately timed OMO purchase operations .
The department also carried out a number of research studies on market movements and behaviour over the year which helped in shaping the policy and operational framework .
The department aims to carry out liquidity management operations effectively in line with the stance of monetary policy by absorbing excess liquidity and maintaining system liquidity at the desired level over the year .
The department will continue to closely monitor evolving liquidity conditions and the impact of the narrowing of the corridor ( with effect from April 06 , 2017 ) on money markets and will modulate market operations to ensure alignment of the weighted average call rate ( WACR ) with the policy rate .
The expansion of currency in circulation will drain most of the surplus liquidity associated with demonetisation .
The residual surplus liquidity , coupled with evolving liquidity inflows and outflows from other sources , will be managed by a judicious mix of the following : ( i ) variable rate repo and reverse repo auctions with a preference for longer tenors ;
The department will continue to conduct foreign exchange intervention operations in an effective manner to curb undue volatility in the exchange rate .
The department also proposes to continue policy-oriented research on financial markets .
The FED aims at facilitating external trade and payments while enhancing ease of doing business .
The department leveraged on information technology for effective monitoring of trade transactions .
In pursuance of greater capital account convertibility , the extant rules and regulations under the Foreign Exchange Management Act ( FEMA ) , 1999 were rationalised further during 2016-17 .
Alongside , the reporting to the Reserve Bank was also simplified .
Further , ADs were delegated with greater operational flexibility in the areas of trade and ECBs .
As per FEMA , regulations on capital account transactions are notified in consultation with the central government .
In the past two years , the Reserve Bank has rationalised a number of regulations in sync with evolving business practices and models relating to , inter alia , export and import of currency ; acquisition of immovable property outside India by persons resident in India ; realisation , repatriation and surrender of foreign exchange ; foreign currency accounts by a person resident in India ; possession and retention of foreign currency ; insurance ; remittance of assets ; manner of receipt and payment ; establishment in India of a branch office or a liaison office or a project office or any other place of business ; and export of goods and services .
The regulations on acquisition and transfer of immovable property in India by a person resident outside India , borrowing and lending between residents and non-residents , and inward and outward investments are being finalised in consultation with the central government .
A Working Group on Import Data Processing and Monitoring System ( IDPMS ) was constituted towards effective monitoring of import payments and , based on its recommendations , a centralised system in the form of IDPMS went live on October 10 , 2016 to facilitate efficient data processing for payment of import transactions and its effective monitoring .
The IDPMS _ provides end-to-end monitoring of import transactions from shipment to final payment , thereby doing away with current monitoring on a stand-alone basis by the custom authorities , AD banks and the Reserve Bank .
Considering that startups have the potential to play a significant role in economic growth and job creation , their access to foreign funds was eased .
Startup companies were permitted to raise funds by issuing convertible notes to persons resident outside India for an amount of ₹ 2.5 million or more in a single tranche .
Further , foreign venture capital investors ( FVCls ) were permitted to invest in ( a ) startups , irrespective of the sector in which the startup operated and ( b ) in any category-I alternative investment fund .
Startups were also allowed to raise ECB up to US $ 3 million or equivalent per financial year either in rupees or any convertible foreign currency or a combination of both .
The policy on foreign investment was oriented towards greater capital account convertibility and facilitating flow of capital .
A comprehensive regulation was issued on receipt of foreign investment by e-commerce entities which clearly defined an e-commerce entity as also inventory based and market place models of e-commerce .
Under the regulations , while foreign investment is permitted up to 100 per cent under automatic route for market place model , foreign investment is prohibited in inventory-based model of e-commerce .
Foreign investment in pension funds was enabled under the automatic route up to 49 per cent .
The ownership and control of the Indian pension fund should , however , remain at all times in the hands of resident Indian entities .
Foreign investment up to 100 per cent was permitted under the automatic route in ' other financial services ' , viz . , activities regulated by a financial sector regulator , subject to certain conditions including minimum capitalisation norms .
The instruments were permitted to be issued up to a limit of five per cent of its capital or US $ 0.5 million whichever was less , subject to certain conditions .
Persons resident outside India were permitted to invest in the equity of asset reconstruction companies ( ARCs ) up to 100 per cent under the automatic route .
Flls / FPls were permitted to invest up to 100 per cent in security receipts ( SRs ) issued by ARCs .
With a view to developing the market for Rupee-denominated bonds overseas as also for providing an additional avenue to Indian banks to raise capital / long term funds , Indian banks were permitted , within the limit set for foreign investment in corporate bonds , to issue ( i ) perpetual debt instruments ( PDI ) qualifying for inclusion as additional tier 1 capital , and debt capital instruments qualifying for inclusion as tier 2 capital , by way of Rupee-denominated bonds overseas ; and ( ii ) long term Rupee- denominated bonds overseas for financing infrastructure and affordable housing .
Further , to provide a fillip to Indian entities issuing Rupee- denominated bonds abroad , multilateral and regional financial institutions in which India is a member country have been permitted to invest in Rupee-denominated bonds .
Certain conditions , pertaining to maturity period , all-in-cost ceiling and recognised investors were added to Rupee- denominated bonds in order to harmonize the instrument with ECBs .
To simplify procedures relating to ECBs , powers have been delegated to designated AD category- | banks to deal with extension of matured but unpaid ECB , provided that ( i ) no additional cost is incurred ; ( ii ) lender ' s consent is available ; and ( iii ) reporting requirements are fulfilled .
Further , powers were delegated to AD category- | banks to approve cases of conversion of matured but unpaid ECB into equity , subject to certain conditions .
A BRICS seminar on ' Investment Flows : Challenges , Opportunities and Road Ahead ' was organised on October 13 , 2016 in Mumbai in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and the Securities and Exchange Board of India .
Panel discussions in the seminar deliberated on topics such as loan and equity capital and investment flows in BRICS , portfolio investment and capital flows from low tax jurisdictions .
The department conducted a number of ' Forex for You ' programmes across the country to spread awareness and clarify issues on FEMA for AD banks and the general public .
Changing trends in global trade and investment flows require calibrated responses , both from Indian companies and _ regulators , necessitating rapid evolution of regulations .
During 2017-18 , the Reserve Bank proposes to put in place , in due consultation with the central government , regulations pertaining to export in services and succession planning through Indian trusts and cross border mergers and acquisitions .
On-line payment gateway service provider ( OPGSP ) guidelines will be reviewed to facilitate e-commerce business and simplify the steps involved in physical fund transfer .
Towards containing the costs of regulatory compliance , merger of certain forms , viz . , advance remittance form ( ARF ) and foreign currency gross provisional return ( FC-GPR ) , is proposed to be completed apart from introducing a Master form online encompassing all FDI reporting .
It also enables the Reserve Bank to constitute committees to advise banking companies on resolution of stressed assets .
Following this , the Reserve Bank released a detailed action plan to implement the Ordinance on May 22 , 2017 .
An Internal Advisory Committee ( IAC ) constituted by the IAC recommended that all accounts with an outstanding amount greater than ₹ 50 billion , and with more than 60 per cent classified as non-performing by banks as on March 31 , 2016 be resolved using the new IBC .
Using these criteria , 12 accounts aggregating to around 25 per cent of the current gross NPAs were referred to the National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ) , a statutory body responsible for judging insolvency proceedings under the new IBC law ' .
Against this backdrop , the following two events are analysed viz . , ( i ) the manner in which the market perceived the passage of the Ordinance empowering the Reserve Bank , and ( ii ) the reaction of stakeholders to the news of identification of default accounts .
With regard to the first event , the event date is defined as the date on which the Ordinance was approved ( May 5 , 2017 ) .
The event window around which the market response is analysed starts nine trading days before the event date and ends nine trading days after the event date .
However , one week prior to the approval of Ordinance , the Finance Minister hinted at empowering the Reserve Bank to address the problem of non-performing assets ( NPAs ) in the Indian banking system .
Since , it was likely that the stock market might have reacted prior to the actual event date , hence the principal empirical analysis here is based on the response of the stock market from five trading days prior to the event till the event date .
The response of the market is analysed by computing abnormal returns ( ARs ) , which are defined as the difference between realised returns and expected returns .
Expected returns are estimated by using the market model wherein for each company or bank , its stock returns are regressed on market returns separately over the estimation window starting 250 days prior to the event window and ending 30 days before the announcement date .
The daily abnormal return is computed as a difference between the actual stock return and expected return calculated from Equation 1 .
The aggregate abnormal returns are computed by cumulating up the abnormal returns across time during the event window .
The analysis focuses on the 36 scheduled commercial banks for which stock market data are available .
Those banks that have a non-performing asset to advances ratio ( NPAR ) above the sample median value for NPAR for all banks in 2015-16 are classified as stressed banks .
While a greater proportion of public sector banks are classified as stressed , almost all private sector banks are classified as non-stressed banks .
The firm sample is divided into three sets on the basis of interest coverage ratio ( ICR ) in 2015-16 : ( i ) low quality ( ICR < 1 ) , ( ii ) intermediate quality ( 1 < ICR < 2 ) , and ( iii ) high quality ( ICR > 2 ) .
Bank-level data are obtained from the Database on Indian Economy ( DBIE ) , RBI .
It examines stock price reactions of the twelve firms that were referred to NCLT for resolution , and the lead banks of these firms .
Figure 1 displays the market response to the President ' s approval of the Banking Amendment Ordinance .
Abnormal returns of stressed banks increased sharply following the Finance Ministers announcement ( dashed red line at -5 in Chart 1 , Panel A ) .
This pattern continues till the event date which is the passage of the Ordinance .
In contrast , non-stressed banks witnessed a more modest increase in abnormal returns .
Strikingly , abnormal returns between stressed and non-stressed banks widened to almost 5 per cent indicating that markets perceived the amendment would help stressed banks in resolving their NPA problem .
Panel B shows that low and intermediate quality firms performed worse than high quality firms .
Overall , these results indicate that the recent amendment to the existing Banking Regulation Act is perceived by the market as being more positive for stressed banks , but negative for low and intermediate quality firms .
The remaining panels in Chart 1 further explore which firms are driving these results , based on whether the firm ' s lead bank is classified as stressed or non-stressed .
Treated firms Control firms All Banks - - Banks related to treated firms - - Remaining banks banks vis-a-vis non-stressed banks .
In contrast , high quality firms linked to stressed banks performed better than high quality firms linked to non-stressed banks at least in the days immediately following the event date .
It appears that the market lost confidence in low quality firms linked to stressed banks but high quality firms linked to stressed banks are seen in a positive light .
One possible explanation is that high quality firms linked to stressed banks benefit from a balance sheet clean-up of stressed banks .
The market may also be reflecting long term benefits to high quality firms possibly through the reallocation of resources away from low quality firms ( Hsieh and Klenow , 2009 and Kulkarni , 2017 ) .
Chart 2 displays the response of the market to the announcement in reference to defaulter accounts .
Panel A shows that defaulter firms realised a decline in abnormal stock returns relative to other firms belonging to the same industry as the defaulter firm .
The identification of these firms by the Reserve Bank was a clear indication of their poor financial health , and it is evident that market stakeholders lost confidence in these firms
Keeping in view the greater role envisaged for asset reconstruction companies ( ARCs ) in resolving stressed assets , regulatory norms for them were revised .
Panel B displays how the market responded to the lead banks of defaulter firms relative to other banks .
In general , the abnormal returns increased for both the sets of banks immediately after the event .
In summary , both event studies point to a positive market reaction for banks but a negative market reaction for distressed firms .
Thus , based on the market reaction , the Ordinance is good news for stressed banks as well as high quality borrowers .
It has the potential to increase efficiency of capital allocation in the Indian economy with significant positive spillover effects on healthy firms and to rejuvenate the banking sector .
The Reserve Bank also identified a revised set of 11 financial conglomerates ( FCs ) for monitoring purposes .
The Reserve Bank formalised a framework for taking enforcement action against banks for non-compliance with guidelines and instructions issued by it .
FSU is responsible for analysing the risks to financial stability , undertaking macro-prudential surveillance through systemic stress tests and other tools , and disseminating information relating to the status of and challenges to financial stability through the bi-annual Financial Stability Report ( FSR ) .
FSU also acts as secretariat to the sub-committee of the Financial Stability and Development Council ( FSDC ) , a coordination council of regulators for maintaining financial stability and monitoring macro-prudential regulation in the country .
As planned , FSR was _ published in December 2016 along with the Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India ( RTP ) andin June 2017 .
Towards strengthening the stress testing framework , a methodology for estimating sectoral probability of defaults to model the dynamics of risk weighted assets was developed and its output is being assessed .
FSU is coordinating the macro-level stress testing exercise of all commercial banks as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Programme ( FSAP ) conducted jointly by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the World Bank .
The Unit carried out stress tests based on the scenarios agreed upon under FSAP so as to broaden the scenario-based stress test analysis .
The key emerging sectoral vulnerabilities of banks have also been analysed .
The FSDC _ sub-committee held two meetings in 2016-17 and reviewed various issues including establishing a statutory financial data management centre , developing corporate bond market , minimum assured return scheme under the National Pension System ( NPS ) , regulation of spot exchanges , setting up of computer emergency response team for the financial sector ( CERT-Fin ) , roadmap for the National Centre for Financial Education , single pension regulator for the pension sector in India , extant macro-prudential framework in India , and framework for identification of systemically important financial institutions ( SIFIs ) .
The status of the recommendations of the financial stability board ( FSB ) peer review of India and the progress of FSAP 2017 were also discussed by the sub-committee .
Inter-Regulatory Technical Group ( IRTG ) , a sub-group of the FSDC sub-committee held one meeting during the year and discussed the implementation of the recommendations of Legal Entity Identifier ( LEI ) working group .
In the year ahead , FSU will continue to conduct macro-prudential surveillance , publish the bi-annual FSR and conduct meetings of the FSDC sub-committee .
The feasibility of expanding the contagion ( network ) analysis to urban cooperative banks will also be examined .
DBRs the nodal department for regulation of commercial banks .
The regulatory measures focus on ensuring a healthy and competitive banking system in the country to promote financial stability , and cost effective and inclusive banking services .
During 2016-17 , the Reserve Bank further strengthened the regulatory framework for dealing with stressed assets , inter alia , by revising its guidelines on the resolution of stressed assets ; viz . , the strategic debt restructuring ( SDR ) scheme , the scheme for sustainable structuring of stressed assets ( S4A ) , flexible structuring of existing long term project loans to infrastructure and core industries ; and guidelines for projects under implementation .
Keeping in view the critical role of the bankruptcy and insolvency regime in shaping the business environment as well as resolution of debtors in distress , the government enacted the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code , 2016 in May 2016 .
This single law will override multiple and overlapping laws and adjudicating forums dealing with financial failures and insolvency of companies and individuals in India ( Box VI.2 ) .
The Reserve Bank issued final guidelines ' banking outlet ' and harmonising the treatment of different forms of bank presence for the purpose of opening banking outlets in under-served areas ( Box VI.3 ) .
IBC lays down a resolution process that is time bound ( 180 days ) and is undertaken by professionals .
It creates an institutional mechanism for the insolvency resolution process for businesses either by coming up with a viable survival mechanism or by ensuring their prompt liquidation .
IBC ' s institutional infrastructure comprises four pillars , viz . , insolvency professionals , information utilities , adjudicating authorities and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India ( IBBI ) .
While insolvency resolution for companies will be adjudicated by the National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ) , the same for firms and individuals will be adjudicated by the Debt Recovery Tribunals ( DRTs ) .
The IBBI is the apex body for promoting transparency and governance in IBC ' s administration .
Where a corporate debtor has defaulted in paying a debt , the corporate insolvency resolution process may be initiated by a financial creditor , an operational creditor or the corporate debtor itself .
A default-based test for entry into the insolvency resolution process permits early intervention when the corporate debtor shows early signs of financial distress .
On the distribution of proceeds from the sale of assets , first priority is accorded to the costs of insolvency resolution and liquidation , and second to the secured debt together with workmen ' s dues for the preceding 24 months .
Central and state governments ' dues are ranked lower in priority .
By providing an effective legal framework for timely resolution of insolvency and bankruptcy , IBC will support the development of credit and corporate bond markets , strengthen debt recovery , encourage entrepreneurship , improve ease of doing business and facilitate more investments .
The code proposes a paradigm shift from the existing ' debtor in possession ' to a ' creditor in control ' regime .
Moreover , the priority accorded to secured creditors is advantageous for entities such as banks .
IBC ' s success hinges to a great extent on the efficient functioning of information utilities .
An adequate number of insolvency professionals will also be needed to handle the large number of cases .
Towards aligning the exposure norms for Indian banks with the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision ( BCBS ) standards and to further diversify the banks ' lending base , on December 1 , 2016 , the Reserve Bank issued final guidelines on large exposures framework ( LEF ) , effective April 1 , 2019 .
The exposure limits will consider a bank ' s exposure to all its counterparties and groups of connected counterparties .
To encourage funding from sources other than bank credit for the corporate sector , the Reserve Bank , in August 2016 , issued guidelines on enhancing credit supply for large borrowers through market mechanism , effective April 1 , 2017 .
Scheduled commercial banks ( SCBs ) were advised that housing finance companies ( HFCs ) will be risk weighted in a manner similar to that of corporates to bring uniformity in the application of risk weights among banks on their exposures .
Banks were allowed to invest in Real Estate Investment Trusts ( REITs ) and _ Infrastructure Investment Trusts ( InvITs ) within the overall ceiling of 20 per cent of net worth for direct investment in convertible bonds / debentures , units of equity-oriented mutual funds and exposures to venture capital funds .
Accordingly , based on the report of an internal working group and public comments on the report , final guidelines clarifying what is a ' banking outlet ' and harmonising the treatment of different forms of bank presence for the purpose of opening outlets in under-served areas were issued on May 18 , 2017 as under :
For a domestic scheduled commercial bank ( DSCB ) , a small finance bank ( SFB ) and a payment bank ( PB ) , it is a fixed point service delivery unit , manned by either bank ' s staff or its BC where services of acceptance of deposits , encashment of cheques / cash withdrawal or lending of money are provided for a minimum of four hours per day for at least five days a week .
If it provides services for less number of hours per day and days in a week , it is considered a part-time banking outlet .
Unbanked rural centre ( URC ) : It is a rural ( Tier 5 and 6 ) centre that does not have a core banking solution ( CBS ) enabled banking outlet of an SCB , a PB , an SFB or an RRB nor a branch of a local area bank or a licensed co-operative bank for carrying out customer based banking transactions .
Conditions for opening banking outlets : At least 25 per cent of banking outlets opened during a financial year must be opened in unbanked rural centres .
Pro-rata benefit for part- time banking outlets will also be extended .
The opening of a banking outlet / part-time banking outlet in a Tier 3 to 6 centre of north-eastern states , Sikkim and left wing extremism affected districts , notified by the Government of India , will be considered as equivalent to opening a banking outlet / part- time banking outlet in a URC .
A bank opening a brick and mortar branch in a rural ( Tier 5 and 6 ) centre which - owing to the presence of a BC outlet of another bank - is not defined as a URC , will also be eligible for the same incentive .
Similar treatment will be given for opening a banking outlet in a rural centre which is served only by a banking outlet of a PB .
Micro Finance Institution ( MFI ) structure of SFBs : Towards preserving the advantages of the MFI / NBFC structure of SFBs to promote financial inclusion , they have been allowed three years from the commencement date , to align their banking network with the extant guidelines .
Till such time , the existing structure may continue and the existing branches will be treated as banking outlets though not immediately reckoning for the 25 per cent norm .
Nevertheless , during this period of three years , the 25 per cent norm will be applicable for all the banking outlets opened or converted from the existing MFI branches in a year .
Role of board of directors : Financial inclusion being the overarching objective of the revised framework and given the operational flexibility being provided to banks , the boards of banks have been accorded overall responsibility to ensure that all the guidelines are complied with , in letter and spirit .
The guidelines on capital requirements for banks ' exposures to central counterparties , April 1 , 2018 , specified the credit risk treatment for exposures to central counterparties arising from over the counter derivatives transactions , exchange traded _ derivatives _ transactions , securities financing transactions and _ long settlement transactions .
The Reserve Bank also issued guidelines for computing exposure for counterparty credit risk arising from derivatives transactions .
In line with the revised BCBS framework on interest rate risk in the banking book , the Reserve Bank issued draft guidelines on governance , measurement and management of interest rate feedback / comments .
In April 2015 , the Reserve Bank had formulated a scheme for setting up of IFSC banking units ( IBUs ) by banks in International Financial Services Centres ( IFSCs ) .
Certain activities are , however , not allowed in view of the fact that IBUs are functioning from the Indian soil and the legal and regulatory framework is still governed by domestic laws and there is no separate financial sector regulator for IFSC .
However , IBUs shall obtain the Reserve Bank ' s prior approval for offering any other derivatives products .
Fixed deposits accepted by IBUs from non-banks cannot be repaid prematurely within the first year .
However , fixed deposits accepted as collateral from non-banks for availing credit facilities from IBUs or deposited as margin in favour of an exchange , can be adjusted prematurely in the event of a margin call or a default in repayment .
An IBU can be a trading member of an exchange in the IFSC for trading in the interest rate and currency derivatives segments that banks operating in India have been allowed to undertake .
An IBU can become a professional clearing member of the exchange in the IFSC for clearing and settlement in any derivatives segment .
IBUs are allowed to extend the facilities of bank guarantees and short term loans to IFSC stock broking / commodity broking entities .
Any financial institution or a branch of a financial institution including an IBU operating in IFSC can maintain special non-resident rupee ( SNRR ) accounts with a bank ( authorised dealer ) in the domestic sector for meeting its administrative expenses in Indian rupee .
These accounts must be funded only by foreign currency remittances through a channel appropriate for international remittances which will be subject to extant FEMA regulations .
A Task Force ( Chairman : Minister of State for Finance ) is monitoring the progress in the development of IFSCs .
The Reserve Bank is a member of the task force .
After a review of the criteria for determining customer liability in unauthorised electronic banking transactions , the final guidelines on customer protection limiting liabilities of customers - have been issued .
An Aadhaar enabled one time pin ( OTP ) based e-KYC process was allowed in December 2016 for on-boarding of customers subject to certain conditions .
The Reserve Bank also prescribed a customer due diligence procedure for opening accounts of judicial persons such as the government or its departments , societies , universities and local bodies like panchayats .
Applying an incurred loss provisioning framework can result in impairments that are recognised after the loss event has occurred , when the probability of default is close to 100 per cent .
Provisions are not made as credit risk increases significantly ( although short of default ) even where bank management has information about stress / future likely losses .
Ind AS 109 expresses the view that delinquency is a lagging indicator of significant increase in credit risk .
The financial assets in Stage 1 are those with no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition , or financial instruments that have low credit risk at the reporting date .
For these assets , 12-month expected credit losses ( ECLs ) are recognised in profit or loss .
The financial instruments in Stage 2 are those which have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition , but with no objective evidence of impairment .
This accounting treatment is based on the rationale that an economic loss arises when ECLs significantly exceed initial expectations .
By recognising lifetime ECLs following a significant increase in credit risk , this economic loss is reflected in the financial statements .
The financial instruments in Stage 3 comprise those for which objective evidence indicates impairment at the reporting date .
These are typically non-performing loans where the bank considers that the borrower is unlikely to pay the existing debt .
The estimated overall impact of Ind AS on regulatory capital is likely to be adverse mainly due to the impairment requirements under it .
In view of the capital constraints already faced by many banks , particularly public sector banks , the Reserve Bank believes that it may be appropriate to introduce transitional arrangements for the impact of accounting changes on regulatory capital .
The Reserve Bank is also considering the introduction of ' regulatory floor for provisioning in the regulatory capital calculation , / .e. , when a bank makes lower accounting provisions than the standardised regulatory floor amounts , the shortfall would be deducted from the bank ' s common equity tier ( CET ) 1 capital , which would incentivise robust provisioning .
operating guidelines for these banks were issued in October 2016 .
The guidelines elaborate upon the areas of prudential regulations , risk management , ownership and control regulations , corporate governance , and banking operations to be adhered to by these banks .
They can mobilise liquidity for banks and financial institutions directly originating priority sector assets , through the securitisation of such assets and actively dealing in them as market makers .
These banks can provide refinance to lending institutions and may be present in capital markets in the form of aggregators .
The primary sources of funds for these banks could be a combination of wholesale and long term deposits ( above a large threshold ) , debt / equity capital raised from primary market issues or private placement , and term borrowings from banks and other financial institutions .
Financial structures in some countries support banks concentrating on wholesale and long-term financing .
Some of these institutions in the public sector , which began as part of the government-backed development policy , have begun their transition towards privatisation .
The stipulations for WLTF banks , expected to be different from universal banks , are mooted as : ( i ) higher initial minimum capital of 210 billion , ( ii ) negligible lending exposure to the retail sector , no savings accounts , and a higher threshold for term deposits of above 7100 million , ( iii ) exemption from Statutory Liquidity Ratio ( SLR ) requirements and some relaxation in the prudential norms on liquidity risk , and ( iv ) exemption from a mandatory rural presence and priority sector lending requirements .
The issues for discussion posed by the discussion paper are : ( i ) whether there is a need for licensing WLTF banks when their proposed activities are currently allowed for universal banks , ( ii ) whether the time is opportune for this , ( iii ) what will be the net impact of such players on the financial system , and ( iv ) whether the proposed regulatory framework is appropriate .
Bank issued licenses to eight SFBs and six PBs during the year taking the number of licensees to 10 in case of SFBs and seven in case of PBs .
Eight SFBs and four PBs have commenced operations .
The Depositors ' Education and Awareness ( DEA ) Fund , started in February 2014 , had accumulated a corpus of ₹ 124 billion at end- March , 2017 , and a total of 2,145 banks were registered for transfer of unclaimed amounts to the DEA Fund .
The fields of specialisation for the directors on the boards of commercial banks ( excluding RRBs ) were broadened in May 2017 to include ( i ) information technology , ( ii ) payment and settlement systems , ( iii ) human resources , ( iv ) risk management , and ( v ) business management to bring in persons with professional knowledge and experience in these fields to the banks ' boards .
An inter-regulatory working group ( Chairman : Shri Sudarshan Sen , Executive Director ) was set up in July 2016 with members drawn from the Reserve Bank , SEBI , IRDA , PFRDA , IDRBT , select banks and rating agencies to examine the granular aspects of Fin Tech , particularly from the perspective of reorienting the regulatory framework .
The report of the working group was submitted to the Reserve Bank in February 2017 for consideration .
The Reserve Bank will continue to focus on improving the institutional framework for a sound banking system in the country , particularly addressing asset quality issues .
In the context of Ind AS implementation , the Bank will issue guidelines on regulatory floors for asset provisioning .
Guidelines on mechanics of the transitional arrangements will also be issued .
It will review other extant instructions in the light of Ind AS implementation .
A discussion paper on margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives was issued in May 2016 .
The final guidelines on margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives will be issued , after a review of the developments globally , as also the availability of infrastructure required for exchange of such margins in India .
The revised framework for securitisation , the minimum capital for market risk and the guidelines on corporate governance as per Basel standards shall also be issued .
The Basel Ill norms prescribe two minimum standards for banks - the liquidity coverage ratio ( LCR ) and the net stable funding ratio ( NSFR ) - for promoting short-term resilience of banks to potential liquidity disruptions and resilience over a longer-term time horizon , respectively .
The LCR guidelines are effective in India since January 1 , 2015 .
The draft guidelines on NSFR were issued in May 2015 .
The final guidelines will be issued during 2017-18 .
The Reserve Bank continues to play a key role in the revival and strengthening of the cooperative banking sector by fortifying the regulatory and supervisory framework .
In this context , DCBR , in charge of prudential regulations of cooperative banks , took the following initiatives in 2016-17 .
The guidelines on non-SLR investments by rural cooperative banks were aligned with those for urban cooperative banks ( UCBs ) .
Guidelines were issued for deployment of point of sale ( POS ) terminals and issuance of prepaid instruments by all cooperative banks .
The government launched a scheme for revival of 23 unlicensed DCCBs ( Uttar Pradesh -16 , Maharashtra - 3 , Jammu and Kashmir - 3 and West Bengal - 1 ) in November 2014 .
Accordingly , a tripartite agreement in the form of a memorandum of understanding was signed between the central government , the concerned state government and NABARD .
There is also a move towards reducing the tiers in the cooperative structure with a view to reducing the cost of borrowings for final borrowers ( Box VI.7 ) .
The short term cooperative credit structure ( STCCS ) of the country primarily meets the crop and working capital requirements of farmers and rural artisans .
The pyramid of STCCS is primarily 3-tier and is federal in nature within a state .
The apex level is the state cooperative bank ( StCB ) , at the district level there are district central cooperative banks ( DCCBs ) and at the village level , there are primary agricultural credit societies ( PACS ) .
Across India , there are more than 93,000 PACS having a membership base of 120 million .
The structure of STCCS is not uniform across the states with a 3-tier structure in 16 states and 2-tier structure in 13 smaller states and union territories where PACS are directly affiliated to StCBs .
There is a mixed structure in three states - 2-tier in some districts and 3-tier in others .
Notwithstanding the phenomenal outreach and volume of operations , the financial health of STCCS has been a matter of concern .
In a 3-tier credit structure , each tier adds to cost and margins leading to an escalation in the cost of borrowings for the ultimate borrowers .
The interest rate structure also varies from one state to another .
Since STCCS deals with relatively larger number of small value loan accounts as compared with commercial banks and RRBs , the transaction cost also tends to be high .
The relevance of the three-tier credit structure has been examined by several committees in the past ( notably , those headed by Professor V. S. Vyas , Shri Jagdish Capoor , Professor Vaidyanathan and Dr.
The Vyas Committee argued for the elimination of one of the tiers to bring down costs for ultimate borrowers .
The NABARD Act , 1981 was amended in 2003 to provide for direct refinance to DCCBs but no concrete action has been initiated towards reducing tiers in STCCS .
In 2013 , the Jharkhand State Cooperative Bank ( JStCB ) took a path breaking initiative and approached the Reserve Bank to approve establishment of a 2-tier rural cooperative structure in the state to replace the age-old 3-tier structure .
The state proposed to merge all the DCCBs with JStCB .
Considering the merits of the request , ' in-principle ' approval was given for the amalgamation of all eight DCCBs with JStCB in October 2013 .
However , since the Dhanbad DCCB went to court against the state ' s decision of amalgamation , the state came up with a revised proposal to amalgamate seven DCCBs with JStCB .
Five merger proposals received from UCBs were approved , out of which two proposals were implemented , two proposals are under process while one proposal was withdrawn by the target bank .
Further , three UCBs voluntarily converted themselves into non-banking institutions under Section 36A ( 2 ) of the Banking Regulation Act , 1949 .
A-scheme of financial assistance to UCBs for implementing the core banking solution ( CBS ) with IDRBT / Indian Financial Technology and Allied Services ( IFTAS ) ( a subsidiary of IDRBT ) .
Under the scheme , the initial setup cost of ₹ 0.4 million is paid by the Reserve Bank to IFTAS .
During the year , 23 UCBs implemented CBS under the scheme taking the number of CBS-compliant UCBs to 1,301 out of a total of 1,561 UCBs .
The Reserve Bank will pursue the process of recapitalisation and licensing of the remaining three DCCBs in Jammu & Kashmir under the rehabilitation scheme approved by the government to create an environment where only licensed rural cooperative banks operate in the banking space .
The supervisory action framework for UCBs , framed in 2014 , will be reviewed with a view to engaging with the concerned banks at an early stage for corrective action .
Implementation of CBS under the scheme of financial assistance to UCBs will be taken forward during the year .
The Reserve Bank will formulate certain standards and benchmarks for CBS in UCBs in consultation with IDRBT in order to make it more robust .
NBFCs play a vital role in providing credit by complementing commercial banks and also cater to some niche sectors .
DNBR is entrusted with the regulation of the NBFC sector with a view to providing a conducive environment for orderly growth of the sector as also protecting the interests of depositors and customers .
During the year , the Reserve Bank issued guidelines on NBFC-account aggregators ( NBFC- AAs ) .
Subsequently , the process of registering NBFC-AAs has been initiated .
The guidelines to banks for relief measures in areas affected by natural calamities , were extended mutatis mutandis to NBFCs .
The guidelines on pricing of credit were issued for NBFC-microfinance institutions ( NBFC- MFIs ) to ensure that the average interest rate on loans sanctioned during a quarter does not exceed the average borrowing cost during the preceding quarter plus the margin , within the prescribed cap .
Guidelines in respect of disbursal of loans in cash by NBFCs were amended to align these with the requirements under the Income Tax Act , 1961 .
Keeping in view the role of asset reconstruction companies ( ARCs ) in resolving stressed assets as also the recent regulatory changes governing the sale of stressed assets by banks to ARCs , the minimum net owned fund requirement for ARCs was fixed at 21 billion on an on-going basis , effective April 28 , 2017 ( Box VI.8 ) .
In terms of Section 30A , 30B and 30C of the SARFAESI Act , 2002 , the Reserve Bank has designated Adjudicating Authority for imposing penalty on ARCs for non-compliance of any direction issued by the Reserve Bank .
Further , the Reserve Bank has designated the Appellate Authority for deciding on an appeal filed by the aggrieved party .
These guidelines will come into force after its notification by the central government .
The NBFC sector has evolved over a period of time resulting in a variety of categories of NBFCs .
The different categories were envisaged to promote specific sector / asset classes hence different sets of regulatory prescriptions were put in place .
These committees suggested a new legislation for securitisation , empowering banks and financial institutions ( Fls ) to take possession of the securities and sell them without the intervention of the court .
Accordingly , the SARFAESI Act ( the Act ) was enacted in 2002 to provide an enabling environment for resolution of NPAs and for strengthening the financial sector .
It provides three alternative methods for recovery of NPAs - securitisation , asset reconstruction and enforcement of security interests .
It envisaged the formation of asset reconstruction companies ( ARCs ) under Section 3 of the Act .
ARC ' s primary goal is to acquire , manage and recover the financial assets which have been classified as NPAs by the banks / Fls .
Presently , there are 24 ARCs in the country .
The Reserve Bank has been assigned powers under the Act to regulate and supervise ARCs .
An ARC can acquire and keep the financial asset - NPAs - in its own balance sheet or transfer it to one or more trust ( s ) ( set up under Section 7 of the Act ) at a price at which the asset was acquired from the originator ( secured lender ) .
Most of the deals are structured with a 15 per cent upfront payment to the seller banks / Fls and issue of security receipts ( SRs ) for the remaining amount with a defined cash-flow waterfall .
Management fee , a primary source of income for ARCs , has priority ( after netting the expenses ) over redemption of SRs .
The trusteeship of such trusts vests with the ARC .
Other recent measures for encouraging the sector include 100 per cent foreign direct investment ( FDI ) under the automatic route , removal of the limit on shareholding by a sponsor , and inclusion of additional qualified buyers for investments in SRs .
There are NBFCs catering to asset financing , infrastructure financing , microfinance , lending , etc .
At present , there are eleven categories of NBFCs - Asset Finance Company ( AFC ) , Loan Company ( LC ) , Investment Company ( IC ) , Core Investment Company ( CIC ) , NBFC-Factor , IDF-NBFC , Infrastructure Finance Company ( IFC ) , NBFC-MFI , NOFHC , NBFC-AA and Mortgage Guarantee Company ( MGC ) .
Going forward , the Reserve Bank will rationalise the NBFCs into fewer categories .
The Bank will oversee the time-bound implementation of Ind AS , converged with IFRS , by NBFCs .
DBS supervises all SCBs ( excluding RRBs ) , local area banks ( LABs ) , payment banks , small finance banks and AIFls within the existing legal and regulatory framework , based on supervisory inputs received through off-site monitoring and on-site inspections .
During 2016-17 , all SCBs operating in India ( excluding RRBs and LABs ) were brought under risk based supervision - Supervisory Programme for Assessment of Risk and Capital ( SPARC ) .
The Reserve Bank also started the process of developing a suitable framework for supervising PBs and SFBs .
The supervisory process is being strengthened by incorporating elements of continuous supervision in off-site monitoring ( Box V1.9 ) .
The inter-regulatory forum for monitoring financial conglomerates ( IRF-FC ) identified a revised set of 11 FCs in the Indian financial sector including five bank-led FCs , four insurance company-led FCs and two securities company-led FCs , based on their significant presence in two or more segments of the financial sector .
A revised prompt corrective action ( PCA ) framework for banks was rolled out for implementation from 2017-18 based on the financials of banks for the year ended March 31 , 2017 .
It provided valuable insights on asset quality at the individual bank / system level and ensured uniformity in identification of non-performing assets ( NPAs ) at the system level .
Further , the early finalisation and communication of divergences in provisioning gave banks more time for effecting the additional provisioning over subsequent quarters .
AQR was extensively based on off-site data from the Central Repository for Information on Large Credits ( CRILC ) .
The exercise clearly brought out the importance of data analysis for effective supervision .
In particular , it emphasised the importance of collecting relevant data , ensuring robust data quality and integrity and the use of IT infrastructure for carrying out an incisive off-site analysis which , in conjunction with on-site assessment , ensures an effectively continuous supervisory assessment .
The prompt corrective action ( PCA ) framework for banks was introduced by the Reserve Bank in December 2002 as an early intervention mechanism .
The sub-committee of the Financial Stability and Development Council ( FSDC-SC ) in its meeting held in December 2014 decided to introduce the PCA framework for all regulated entities .
Subsequently , the Reserve Bank reviewed the existing PCA framework keeping in view the recommendations of the working group on resolution regimes for financial institutions in India ( January 2014 ) , the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission ( FSLRC , March 2013 ) and international best practices .
In line with BCBS principles on cross- border supervisory cooperation , the Reserve Bank has set up supervisory colleges for Indian banks with considerable overseas presence , viz . , State Bank of India ( SBI ) , ICICI Bank Ltd . , Bank of Baroda , Bank of India , Punjab National Bank and Axis Bank Ltd .
The major objectives of supervisory colleges are to enhance information exchange and cooperation among supervisors to improve understanding of the risk profile of the banking group , thereby facilitating more effective supervision of the internationally active banks .
The Reserve Bank held meetings of all the supervisory colleges during 2016-17 .
However , common equity Tier-1 ( CET 1 ) ratio will constitute an additional trigger and leverage will also be monitored .
The revised PCA defines certain risk thresholds , breach of which would lead to invocation of PCA and invite certain mandatory and discretionary actions .
The PCA framework will apply to all banks operating in India including small banks and foreign banks operating through branches or subsidiaries .
The Reserve Bank conducted trainings on cyber security with hands-on sessions for its IT examiners to build skills in cyber security assessment .
In order to improve data quality , a working group was set up with members from major public sector , private and foreign banks to rationalise existing off-site returns .
The group submitted its report in September 2016 .
The various recommendations of the group , after due consideration and approval , are being implemented in a phased manner .
Towards enhancing supervisory focus , the department conducted some thematic studies during the year relating to derivatives portfolio and custodial services offered by foreign banks ; non-credit related facilities and trade finance ; and real estate exposure / housing finance .
The studies were shared with the concerned departments for policy action .
Migration of supervisory returns , other than off-site monitoring and _ surveillance ( OSMOS ) returns , to the eXtensible business reporting language ( XBRL ) reporting platform is under progress .
Taking the process of cross-border supervisory cooperation and exchange of supervisory information further , the Reserve Bank signed memoranda of understanding ( MoUs ) with seven overseas banking supervisory authorities during the year , viz . , the Central Bank of Myanmar , the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency of Turkey , the Central Bank of Nigeria , the Bank of Zambia , the Bank of Guyana , the Bank of Thailand and the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan .
Further , a letter of cooperation was executed with the Czech National Bank .
With this , the Reserve Bank has signed 40 MoUs , two letters of cooperation and one statement of cooperation .
The Reserve Bank launched a Central Fraud Registry ( CFR ) , a web-based online searchable database in January 2016 .
However , usage of CFR by banks , especially PSBs , is yet to pick up on expected lines .
A joint working group of regulators constituted by IRF-FC will develop a format and structure for a data template for capturing systemic risks arising out of FC activities .
As part of capacity building on SPARC , the Reserve Bank will continue to conduct focused workshops and orientation sessions for internal and external stakeholders .
Further , specific sessions for board members and top managements of the banks as also for other external stakeholders will be on the agenda for 2017-18 .
A _ suitable supervisory framework for small finance banks and payment banks will be developed and implemented .
Further , in view of the implementation of Ind AS by banks , its impact on their quantitative and qualitative reporting will be reviewed , aligned and integrated with the supervisory framework .
Taking into account concerns arising from examination of IT risks in banks , thematic studies and assessments will be undertaken on specific domains for appropriate policy and supervisory interventions ( Box VI.11 ) .
In the wake of exponential growth of digitalisation in banks , cyber risks have emerged as a major area of concern .
Conscious of the rising threats to the cyber infrastructure in its regulated entities , the Reserve Bank has taken a number of measures , particularly over the last two years .
Banks ' progress in strengthening their cyber resilience and response is being monitored .
Recognising the increasing frequency and complexity of cyber security incidents , the monetary policy statement of February 8 , 2017 announced that an Inter-disciplinary Standing Committee will be set up to conduct an ongoing review of the cyber security landscape and emerging threats .
The remit of the committee , inter alia , includes reviewing the threats inherent in existing / emerging technology ; studying adoption of various security standards / protocols ; interfacing with stakeholders ; and suggesting appropriate policy interventions to strengthen cyber security and resilience .
The committee was constituted on February 28 , 2017 ( Chairperson : Smt . Meena Hemchandra Executive Director ) . Members of the committee include experts on cyber security in the reserve bank as well as from outside .
The committee is meeting regularly and , as per its recommendations , sub- groups have been formed on certain focus areas for an in- depth examination .
Based on the off-site assessment of the key risk indicators in cyber security , IT examinations with a risk based approach will be conducted in 2017-18 .
The findings will be factored in the overall assessment of risks in banks .
Assessment of IT risks in other regulated entities such as major urban cooperative banks will be covered in a phased manner .
A back office support system ( BOSS ) has been established for this .
With a view to enabling a more efficient supervisory assessment of banks , BOSS will develop standard data templates on major concern areas under various risk categories .
DCBS is entrusted with the supervisory responsibility of primary ( urban ) cooperative banks ( UCBs ) to ensure a safe and well managed cooperative banking sector .
The department undertakes supervision of these banks on an on- going basis through periodic on-site inspections and continuous off-site monitoring .
The Reserve Bank began focused attention on select weak UCBs by way of intensive hand-holding and periodic training in the identified areas of weakness .
It organised a conference on ' Building Banks Co-operatively - Professionalise and Progress in Anmedabad inviting participation from the state government , other stakeholders and the top management of the Reserve Bank .
During the year , several training programmes for capacity building were conducted by regional offices for CEOs / directors / officials of UCBs and auditors of UCBs .
The department will continue to identify select UCBs for hand-holding and impart focused training to them for all round improvement in their functioning .
In addition , the Department will take initiatives for capacity building for both supervisors and supervised entities - UCBs - in the coming year .
In this direction , conferences on cooperative banking as organised last year will be conducted .
As the development of software package for DCBS returns has been completed under XBRL-based reporting platform , the Department will focus on stabilising the package and ensuring submission of timely and reliable data through the platform by all UCBs .
DNBS supervises the NBFC sector in the country , which is a fast growing sector with significant diversity in terms of size and operational dimensions .
The department supervises more than 11,500 NBFCs of which 222 are non-deposit taking systemically important ones .
The role of statutory auditors in the certification process was enhanced by enabling on-line filing of statutory auditors certificate ( SAC ) .
Further , the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ( ICAI ) agreed to digitally authenticate the returns of small NBFCs on the XBRL platform , which will be operationalised soon .
The Reserve Bank focused on improving adherence to the fair practices code by NBFCs through levy of penalties .
The Bank is in the final stages of incorporating risk factors in the existing CAMELS model of inspection of NBFCs .
The project for automation of all regulatory approvals of NBFCs has been initiated and this will be operationalised in 2017- 18 .
The Reserve Bank also operationalised a formal PCA framework for NBFCs .
The department will put in place a supervisory rating system for ARCs .
The Reserve Bank launched a mobile friendly portal Sachet ( sachet.rbi.org.in ) on August 4 , 2016 to help the public as well as regulators to ensure that only regulated entities accept deposits from the public .
The portal can be used by the public to share information including through uploading photographs of advertisements / publicity material , raise queries on any fund raising / investment schemes that they come across and lodge and track complaints .
The portal has links to all regulators and the public can easily access information on lists of regulated entities .
A detailed standard operating procedure for non- compliant and / or inactive small NBFCs will also be operationalised .
Taking note of the changes in the global and domestic financial sector environment , with a view to separate the function of identification of contravention of respective statutes / guidelines and directives by the regulated entities from imposition of punitive action and to make this process endogenous , formal and structured , a separate Enforcement Department was created within the Reserve Bank with effect from April 3 , 2017 ( Box VI.13 )
It will help in enhancing coordination among regulators and state government agencies and will serve as a useful source of information for early detection and curbing of unauthorised acceptance of deposits .
The portal is designed to place the entire proceedings of SLCCs on an IT platform .
It facilitates comprehensive MIS with respect to complaints received , referred to regulators / law enforcement agencies and for monitoring the progress in redressal of such complaints .
Complaints relating to unauthorised deposit collection and financial activities that have been lodged in Sachet have been taken up expeditiously with respective regulators for resolution .
The core function of the department is to enforce regulations with the objective of ensuring financial system stability and promoting public interest and consumer protection .
Taking cognisance of such a need , the Board for Financial Supervision approved a Supervisory Enforcement Framework for action against non-compliant banks .
Following a subsequent announcement in the 6 " " bi-monthly monetary policy statement of February 2017 , a separate Enforcement Department was established in April Over time ,
To begin with , the department will focus on the enforcement of penalty provisions under the Banking Regulation Act .
In the medium-term , the entire enforcement function of the Reserve Bank will be migrated to EFD .
In 2017-18 , the department will develop a policy framework for enforcement ; put in place detailed protocols for information sharing with other regulatory and supervisory departments of the Reserve Bank , other regulators and the government ; create channels for generating actionable market intelligence ; and initiate enforcement action .
CEPD is the nodal department in the Bank for monitoring the function of protection of consumer interests .
The Reserve Bank operationalised the Charter of Customer Rights in 2014-15 for strengthening customer protection in banks .
During the year , the Reserve Bank advised the banks to furnish a certificate in the specified proforma under the signature of the MD or CEO certifying that their customer service policy was fine-tuned to incorporate the principles of the Charter of Customer Rights .
All the banks have submitted the certificate .
The scheme has been reviewed periodically and its latest comprehensive review was undertaken in 2015-16 covering pecuniary jurisdiction of the BO , compensation and grounds of complaint and rationalisation of certain clauses of the scheme .
The scheme was amended accordingly .
The amended Reserve Bank also opened and operationalised five new offices of the BO in Dehradun , Jammu , Ranchi , Raipur and an additional office in New Delhi .
At present , the total number of BO offices has reached 20 .
The Reserve Bank in consultation with the Indian Banks ' Association ( IBA ) reviewed the forms commonly used by customers in banks and suggested standardisation of these forms .
Accordingly , IBA released modified and user friendly specimens of ten commonly used forms during the year to banks for implementation .
Aspects and modalities of setting up of an Ombudsman Scheme ( OBS ) for NBFCs were examined and discussed with concerned regulatory and supervisory departments ( Box VI.14 ) .
The Reserve Bank will formulate an appropriate OBS for NBFCs and operationalise it by establishing the offices of the ombudsman for NBFCs at select centres .
It will also conduct surveys on : ( i ) charges levied by banks for basic banking services ; ( ii ) KYC compliance ; and ( iii ) mis-selling by banks .
As compared to banks , the NBFCs are relatively larger in number and vary substantially in terms of their activities and size .
Section 45 L of the RBI Act empowers the Reserve Bank to , inter alia , give directions to Financial Institutions .
The OBS for NBFCs is proposed to be operationalised by the Reserve Bank under Section 45 L of the RBI Act .
All the public sector banks and select private and foreign banks had appointed Internal Ombudsman ( lO ) in 2015-16 to examine the grievances that are not resolved by the respective bank ' s internal grievance redressal mechanism .
During 2017-18 , the Reserve Bank will conduct a review of the IO scheme to make it more effective .
The proposed scheme will initially cover all deposit taking NBFCs and those with customer interface and an asset size of ₹ 1 billion and above .
However , asset reconstruction companies , infrastructure finance companies , infrastructure debt funds , core investment companies , and NBFC factors will not be covered under the scheme for the time being .
Complaints relating to non-adherence to the Fair Practices Code , infringement of customer rights , deficiencies in services , use of coercive measures , mis-selling , violation of regulatory guidelines , non-repayment / delayed repayment of deposits and / or interest are some of the categories of complaints that will be covered under the scheme .
The Reserve Bank also redresses the complaints received against regulated entities from their customers through Consumer Education and Protection Cells ( CEPCs ) set up in every office of the Bank .
Customers can also approach the offices of the BOs to lodge their complaints against banks on the grounds of complaints listed in the revised BO scheme .
During 2017-18 , the Reserve Bank will deploy a complaint management system ( CMS ) to streamline the processing of complaints ( Box VI.15 ) .
The Reserve Bank has initiated the work for setting up a complaint management system ( CMS ) with a view to harnessing the benefits of information technology ( IT ) for managing the increasing volume of complaints being received by it .
The web-based CMS will replace the existing complaint tracking system ( CTS ) which has served for over a decade .
CMS will help the Reserve Bank not only to manage the complaints more efficiently but also provide a robust management information system .
CMS will also help to monitor the performance of the regulated entities in the area of management and redressal of complaints .
Deposit insurance contributes to the stability of the financial system and _ protects depositors ' interests .
In India , DICGC - a wholly- owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank - provides insurance cover to deposits in all commercial banks including LABs , payment banks , small finance banks , RRBs and cooperative banks .
With the present limit of $ 0.1 million , the number of fully protected accounts ( 1,737 million ) as on March 31 , 2017 constituted 92.1 per cent of the total number of accounts ( 1,885 million ) as against the international benchmark of 80 per cent .
In terms of amount , the total insured deposits at ₹ 30.5 trillion at end-March 2017 constituted 29.5 per cent of the assessable deposits at ₹ 103.5 trillion as compared with the international benchmark of 20-30 per cent .
The Corporation builds its Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) through transfer of surplus , that is , excess of income ( mainly comprising premia received from the insured banks , coupon income from investments and cash recovery out of assets of failed banks ) over expenditure ( payment of depositors ' claims and related expenses ) net of taxes .
During 2016-17 , the corporation sanctioned total claims of ₹ 0.6 billion as against ₹ 0.5 billion during the preceding year .
The Corporation has improved the quality of information disseminated through its website by updating FAQs and guidelines for liquidators .
It has also published a primer on deposit insurances and placed on the website .
With a view to accelerating the resolution of outstanding issues , DICGC held several meetings with liquidators and also requested chief secretaries of states to expedite the appointment of liquidators .
The Corporation will continue to focus on adherence to core principles on effective deposit insurance systems in 2017-18 .
The Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill , 2017 , which was introduced in the up of a Resolution Corporation ( RC ) to ensure observance of the Financial Stability Board ' s Key Attributes on resolution of financial firms by addressing the gaps in the current resolution mechanism in India in terms of legal framework , resolution tools , liquidation , coverage of entities , cross-border cooperation and the oversight framework .
The proposed RC will subsume DICGC which at present performs the ' pay box ' function , that is , reimbursement of insured amounts to the depositors of failed banks .
DICGC also participates in merger schemes approved by the Reserve Bank involving payment to the depositors of transferee bank .
RC is being established for protection of consumers of specified service providers and of public funds for ensuring stability and resilience of the financial system .
The primary function of NHB - the apex institution for housing finance - is to register , regulate and supervise housing finance companies ( HFCs ) .
It also provides refinance to HFCs , SCBs , RRBs and cooperative sector institutions for housing loans and directly lends ( project finance ) to borrowers in the public and private sectors for extending financial support to the housing programmes for the unserved and under-served segments of the population .
The entire capital of ₹ 14.5 billion of NHB is subscribed by the Reserve Bank .
Out of the total disbursement made under refinance ( ₹ 226.8 billion ) in 2016-17 ( July-June ) , 20.1 per cent ( ₹ 45.6 billion ) was made under the Rural Housing Fund ( RHF ) and 9.8 per cent ( ₹ 22.3 billion ) was made under the Urban Housing Fund ( UHF ) .
As a nodal agency for implementing the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme ( CLSS ) under the ' Housing for All by 2022 ' mission of the government , NHB had released total subsidy claim ( net of refunds ) under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana ( PMAY ) CLSS ( including economically weaker section ( EWS ) / low income group ( LIG ) Old , EWS / LIG New and middle income group ( MIG ) ) amounting to low income group ( LIG ) Old , EWS / LIG New andlow income group ( LIG ) Old , EWS / LIG New andlow income group ( LIG ) Old , EWS / LIG New and ₹ 7.5 billion to 96 primary lending institutions till June .
NHB managed the Credit Risk Guarantee Fund Trust for Low Income Housing with the objective of providing guarantees with respect to low-income housing loans .
As on June 30 , 2017 , the trust has issued guarantee cover for 1,972 loan accounts of 14 member lending institutions ( MLIs ) involving total loan amount of ₹ 561 million provided to EWS / LIG households and guarantee cover of ₹ 476 million to 14 institutions .
However , the yields hardened in February 2017 in response to shift in the monetary policy stance from accommodative to neutral .
The benchmark yield softened thereafter on lower inflation data , FPI buying and expectations of normal monsoon .
The Reserve Bank in consultation with Gol followed a strategy of front loading of issuances , but modulated its market borrowings from the budget estimates during the fourth quarter , reducing thereby , the supply of sovereign paper in the market .
As against gross market borrowings of ₹ 6,000 billion through dated securities proposed in the Union Budget 2016-17 , the actual amount mobilised was modulated to ₹ 5,820 billion on the back of higher surplus cash balances of the central government .
Net market borrowings through dated securities amounted to ₹ 4,082 billion in 2016-17 , registering a decline of 7.4 per cent and financing 76.4 per cent of the gross fiscal deficit ( GFD ) , as against 82.0 per cent in the previous year .
On the other hand , net short term market borrowings through T-Bills increased to ₹ 186 billion during 2016-17 from ₹ 152 billion in 2015-16 mainly due to higher issuances in H1 of 2016-17 .
In the aggregate , however , net market borrowing through dated securities and T-Bills declined by ₹ 291 billion to ₹ 4,268 billion in 2016-17 ( Table VII.1 ) .
The weighted average maturity ( WAM ) of the outstanding stock increased marginally to 10.65 years as at end-March 2017 ( Table VII.2 ) .
However , the WAM of issuances during 2016-17 declined by 1.27 years to 14.76 years , reflecting relatively larger issuances in the maturity buckets below 19 years .
Out of 164 auctions , 156 were reissuances during the year .
Buyback / switches amounted to ₹ 1,046 billion in 2016-17 as compared to ₹ 611 billion in the previous year .
Furthermore , the share of issuances in the two long maturity buckets declined from 38 per cent in 2015-16 to 29 per cent in 2016-17 , mirroring the relatively muted demand for long bonds .
During 2016-17 , the residual maturity of 59 per cent of the market borrowings through dated securities was 10 years and beyond , as compared with 66 per cent during the previous year , mirroring an increase in the share of maturities less than 10 years ( Table VII.3 ) .
With the objective of catering to the demand for long term investors such as insurance companies and pension funds , 30 and 35-year tenor bonds were issued during the year .
The elevated supply of SDLs , including UDAY bonds during 2016-17 resulted in devolvement of central government securities on Primary Dealers ( PDs ) on four instances for an aggregate amount of ₹ 53 billion , as compared with devolvement of ₹ 110 billion during the previous year .
The share of the PDs in the subscription to primary auctions of central government securities stood at 47.6 per cent in 2016-17 , down from 54.2 per cent in 2015-16 .
The underwriting commission paid to PDs during 2016-17 declined to ₹ 0.357 billion from ₹ 0.471 billion during 2015-16 , mainly onaccount of ample liquidity conditions .
There was only a single instance of devolvement amounting to ₹ 32 billion in Q1 of 2017-18 .
All the standalone PDs complied with their target commitments in auction bidding , secondary market turnover targets and continued to maintain capital to risk weighted assets ratio ( CRAR ) above the minimum requirement of 15 per cent .
The outstanding dated securities of central government registered 8.4 per cent year-on-year growth in 2016-17 .
Commercial banks , including the PD segment remained the largest holder with 40 per cent share as at end-March 2017 , followed by insurance companies with a share of 22.9 per cent .
The Reserve Bank held 14.7 per cent while provident funds held 6.3 per cent .
The Reserve Bank successfully managed the issuances of SGBs _ during 2016-17 .
Four tranches of SGBs for an aggregate amount of ₹ 34.69 billion ( 11.44 ton ) were issued during the year .
Since the inception of the scheme in November 2015 , a total of ₹ 60.29 billion ( 20.73 ton ) has been mobilised and SGBs have been allotted to approximately ₹ 1.4 million retail investors including the issuances of two tranches in ( May and July ) 2017-18 .
The MTDS was formulated as a debt management framework in 2015 , in consultation with the Government of India , for a period of three years and rolled over each year .
It is premised on three broad pillars : low cost , risk mitigation and market development .
The MTDS , which is in line with international best practices , calibrates certain benchmarks on the composition of debt in terms of short and long term , floating and fixed rate , and maturity of debt .
It also stipulates stress tests and scenario analysis in relation to costs , maturity and potential risks .
The debt of the central government has been reviewed against the MTDS benchmarks and found to be stable and sustainable .
With a view to encouraging wider participation and retail holding of T-Bills and in line with the first bi-monthly monetary policy statement of 2015-16 , the central government in consultation with the Reserve Bank , extended the non-competitive bidding facility in T-Bills to retail investors up to a ceiling of 5 per cent of the notified amount .
As mentioned earlier , net market borrowings through T-Bills increased during 2016- 17 .
The yields on T-Bills largely mimicked the declining trend in the yields of dated securities in 2016-17 .
Reflecting the increase in appetite for T-Bills from market participants , the Primary Dealers ' share in T-Bills auctions declined to 74.4 per cent from 75.4 per cent during 2015-16 .
The PDs individually achieved the stipulated minimum success ratio of 40 per cent in bidding while the success ratio of the PD system as a whole was 58.8 per cent and 60.0 per cent during H1 and H2 , respectively , of 2016-17 .
With a view to absorbing excess liquidity in the banking system following demonetisation in November 2016 , the limit for the MSS was increased .
Under MSS , the total amount of cash management bills ( CMBs ) issued , for tenors ranging from 14 to 63 days , amounted to ₹ 10,115 billion , with associated interest outgo of ₹ 57 billion .
During 2017-18 ( up to June 30 ) , T-Bills issued under MSS for tenors ranging from 312 to 329 days amounted to ₹ 1,000 billion .
Deposits mobilised under this scheme amounted to ₹ 12.4 billion .
The WMA limits for the central government for the first and the second halves of 2016-17 were increased each by ₹ 50 billion to ₹ 500 billion and ₹ 250 billion , respectively .
The government was in WMA for 26 days during 2016-17 vis-a-vis 15 days during the previous year .
The accommodation to the central government under WMA was ₹ 1,567 billion during 2016-17 as compared with ₹ 838 billion in 2015-16 .
The government resorted to overdraft ( amounting to 68 billion ) only once during the year on July 5 , 2016 .
The government ' s cash position improved subsequently , mainly on account of increased tax flows and higher investments in intermediate / auction treasury bills ( ITBs / ATBs ) by state governments ( Chart VII.2 ) .
With the advancement of budget presentation this year , the government units have started to frontload expenditure , unlike in the previous years .
This combined with low net tax receipts and large redemption pressure in the first quarter of 2017-18 , caused the cash balances of the central government to move into prolonged periods of deficit , warranting issue of CMBs of ₹ 1,300 billion during the Q1 of 2017-18 .
The switch operations undertaken in January , March and June 2017 helped in easing the stress in the cash balances to a certain extent .
The WMA limit for the first quarter of 2017-18 was set at ₹ 600 billion while the same for the second quarter would be ₹ 700 billion .
The WAY of state government securities issued during 2016-17 stood lower at 7.48 per cent than that of 8.28 per cent in the previous year .
Despite softening of yield across securities , the weighted average spread of SDL issuances over the comparable central government securities increased to 60 bps from 50 bps in 2015-16 .
The inter-state spread which was on an average in the range of 7 bps in 2016-17 same as in the previous year though higher than 4 bps in 2014- 15 , however , does not reflect the fiscal strength of the states in the pricing of SDLs .
During 2016-17 , thirteen states issued UDAY bonds for ₹ 1,091 billion as against ₹ 990 billion raised by eight states in the previous year .
The spreads of UDAY bonds during 2016-17 declined to 35-75 bps over the corresponding tenor / 10-year FIMMDA G-Sec yield as compared with a fixed spread of 75 bps in 2015-16 .
Approximately 45 per cent of the total UDAY bond issuances in 2016-17 were concentrated in Q4 .
Puducherry issued SDLs with tenors above 10 years and many states issued non-standard securities of tenors ranging from 2 to 20 years .
As a strategic response to higher spreads , four states rejected all the bids in some auctions .
Furthermore , the Reserve Bank has been working closely with state governments to facilitate efficient cash and liability management operations of states , with the objective of consolidation through elongation of debt , reissuances and buyback of high cost debt , while keeping an eye on redemption capacities of states .
As part of the ongoing endeavour to consolidate the debt in SDLs through buybacks , the state of Maharashtra repurchased ₹ 10.83 billion of its debt .
The aggregate WMA limit for 28 states and the Union Territory of Puducherry was revised from ₹ 154 billion to ₹ 322 billion with effect to WMA in 2016-17 , the same number as in the previous year .
Consequent to the increase in WMA limits , only 4 states resorted to overdrafts in 2016-17 as against 9 states in 2015-16 .
The rediscount rate has , consequently , also been re- fixed at reverse repo rate minus 150 bps , subject to an upper ceiling of 5.5 per cent .
Outstanding investment by states in the CSF and the GRF as at end-March 2017 stood at ₹ 884 billion and ₹ 49 billion , respectively .
During the year , total investment in CSF and GRF was 176 billion ( including fresh investment of ₹ 57 billion and reinvestments of ₹ 119 billion ) as compared to ₹ 134 billion during 2015-16 .
The Union Budget 2017-18 projected gross market borrowings of ₹ 5,800 billion through dated securities , a marginal decline of ₹ 20 billion from that in the previous year .
Net short term borrowings ( / .e. , through T-Bills ) is budgeted at ₹ 20 billion , substantially lower than that of ₹ 186 billion in the previous year .
Net market borrowings via dated securities and T-Bills would finance 77.8 per cent of the GFD in 2017-18 as compared with 79.6 per cent in 2016-17 .
In line with the policy of front-loading of issuances , 64 per cent ( i.e. , ₹ 3,720 billion ) of the gross market borrowings is slated to be raised in the first half of 2017-18 .
This , in turn , would also help to manage the redemption pressure during H1 of 2017-18 when 90 per cent ( / .e. , ₹ 1,566 billion ) of the total redemptions would fall due .
The borrowing programme of the centre and state governments would continue to be guided by the pillars of low cost , risk mitigation and market development by adopting the following strategic measures :
Host a single web link on the Reserve Bank website for public debt through consolidation of various links pertaining to internal and external public debt information .
Preparation of draft compendium for state governments on best practices in cash management and a model cash _ flow statement on pilot basis .
The thrust of the Working Group is towards identifying contingent liabilities and standardising risk management and mitigation measures , while bringing in uniformity in disclosure across states for better peer group analysis .
The Working Group is expected to submit its report shortly .
The total value of coins in circulation increased by 14.7 per cent in 2016-17 as against 12.4 per cent last year , while the total volume of coins in circulation increased by 8.5 per cent as compared with 8.2 per cent in the previous year .
Coins of ₹ 1 and ₹ 2 together constituted 69.2 per cent of the total volume of coins in circulation , while in value terms , these accounted for 44.8 per cent ( Table VIII.2 ) .
In order to improve the currency distribution system by leveraging on technology , the Reserve Bank adopted a hub and spoke model for distribution of banknotes across the country .
Fresh note remittances were sent to larger currency chests , which meet the currency needs of a designated area ( such as a district ) , identified as hub chests and these , in turn , supplied notes to smaller currency chests in their vicinity which acted like spokes in the distribution model .
Fresh notes were distributed to every issue office of the Reserve Bank as per a planned allocation .
The Reserve Bank estimates the demand for currency using an econometric model which factor in , inter alia , expected real GDP growth , rate of inflation and denomination-wise disposal rate of soiled notes .
However , 2016-17 was an exceptional year on account of the demonetisation and the gradual replenishment of withdrawn notes by new notes of different denominations .
Accordingly , the total number of banknotes supplied was higher at 29.0 billion pieces in 2016-17 as compared with 21.2 billion pieces in 2015-16 .
The total supply of notes was 3.5 per cent higher than the indent placed with the printing presses for 2016-17 , while the indent itself was higher by around 17.4 per cent than that of the previous year ( Table VIII.4 ) .
Demand for coins have increased over the years as reflected in rising indents as well as supply ( Table VIII.5 ) .
During the past three years , on an average , Mints have , however , been able to supply 62.3 per cent of the indented quantity due to capacity constraints .
During 2016-17 , 762,072 pieces of counterfeit notes were detected in the banking system , of which 95.7 per cent were detected by commercial banks ( Table VIII.7 ) .
Detection of counterfeit notes was 20.4 per cent higher than the previous year .
During 2016-17 , the National Crime Records Bureau ( NCRB ) , Ministry of Home Affairs designed a uniform proforma for collection of Fake Indian Currency Note ( FICN ) data .
The Reserve Bank is facilitating implementation of the system in collaboration with NCRB .
The trail of deposits of SBNs into bank accounts may provide valuable information to the revenue authorities in tracing unaccounted money .
A two-stage cluster sampling technique was adopted to obtain the best estimate of FICNs detected at currency chests ( CCs ) and at the Reserve Bank in the post-demonetisation period , given the constraints , including time lags inherent in the verification processes .
The currency chests located under the jurisdiction of the 19 issue offices of the Reserve Bank were classified on the basis of four population groups , viz . , rural ; semi-urban ; urban ; and metro .
Samples were drawn from each of these clusters in two stages : in the first stage , CCs were selected randomly from each cluster ; in the second stage , SBNs were chosen randomly from the selected CCs .
Based on this approach , overall , 25 per cent of CCs ( 1,051 CCs for ₹ 500 and 1,018 CCs for ₹ 1000 ) and 9.2 per cent ( 2.2 billion pieces ) SBNs were selected in the sample and subjected to statistical tests to ensure the accuracy of the estimates derived from the sample .
As compared to 2015-16 , 12 clusters for 500 denomination and 14 clusters for ™ 1000 denomination showed statistically significant higher rate of FICN detection during the post-demonetisation period .
This implies a significant pick-up in the rate of FICN detection at the Reserve Bank level in the post-demonetisation period as compared to a year ago .
The upsurge in expenditure during the year was on account of change in the production plan of printing presses due to the introduction of new design notes in higher denominations as well as the requirement of larger volume of notes for replacement of the demonetised currency .
Currency management is a core function of the Reserve Bank of India .
The Department of Currency Management plays a key role in meeting the legitimate demand of the public for banknotes and coins by ensuring continuous supply and circulation of notes and coins of various denominations across the country .
Another major thrust during the year was to prudently manage the transition towards remonetisation following the demonetisation , through increased supply of new notes as well as proper distribution of those notes across the country in a prompt manner .
In line with this practice , a new series ( Mahatma Gandhi New Series ) of banknotes in new design , dimensions and denominations , highlighting the cultural heritage and scientific achievements of the country , was introduced during the year .
As part of this process , banknotes in the denominations of ₹ 500 and ₹ 2000 were introduced on November 8 , 2016 .
In order to enhance customer service , the scheme of incentives and penalties for banks for provision of banknotes and coin related services has been rationalised .
In this regard , a revised scheme of incentives titled Currency Distribution and Exchange Scheme ( CDES ) was formulated and issued to banks .
The process of amending Note Refund Rules , 2009 to include the new Mahatma Gandhi series of ₹ 500 and ₹ 2000 denomination banknotes has also been initiated .
The Reserve Bank continued with its medium / long term objective of indigenisation of security features for Indian banknotes during the year .
In this regard , the report of the High Level Steering Committee on indigenisation of security features of banknotes under the Chairmanship of former Deputy Governor , Shri R. Gandhi , has been submitted to the Government of India .
In order to make India self-reliant in banknote paper production , indigenous production of Cylinder Mould Vat Made Watermarked Bank Note ( CWBN ) paper at the Bank Note Paper Mill India Private Limited ( BNPMIPL ) , Mysuru , started during the year .
A proposal to set up a security ink factory at Mysuru was accorded in-principle approval .
With the objective of introducing mechanised vaults , a greenfield project at the Reserve Bank , Naya Raipur , and a brownfield project at the Reserve Bank , Belapur , have been taken up on a pilot basis by the Reserve Bank .
The offices of the Reserve Bank , bank branches and post offices offered the exchange / deposit facility to the general public .
The exchange of SBNs for legal tender notes was allowed at commercial bank branches ( barring branches of district central co-operative banks , except for four days from November 10-14 , exchange facility was restricted to the Reserve Bank Offices .
Limits on withdrawal from bank counters and ATMs were also imposed to gradually meet the demand for new currency following the demonetisation .
However , these limits were modified and relaxed from time to time , enabling higher withdrawals for essential purposes in line with the evolving situation .
To ensure availability of currency for people in remote / unbanked areas various measures , viz . , deployment of Micro ATMs near village panchayat offices and at military outposts , use of mobile vans , etc. were undertaken .
In order to address agricultural requirements during the rabi crop season , SBNs were allowed to be used for purchase of seeds .
Additional withdrawal limit for farmers and traders registered with Agricultural Produce Market Committee ( APMC ) markets / mandis were put in place .
Banks were also advised to open accounts ( in a camp mode ) for workers , while currency chests were advised to ensure adequate cash supply to the district central co-operative banks ( DCCBs ) / regional rural banks ( RRBs ) .
In view of the logistical difficulties in supplying banknotes to all currency chests in a short span , the Hub and Spoke model was adopted for distribution of notes across the country .
Fresh notes were distributed to every Issue Office in accordance with a planned allocation .
The Regional Office-wise allocation of notes was revised during the last quarter of 2016-17 based on the SBNs deposited and cash supplied in issue circles during the demonetisation period .
The annual indent and projections for demand of banknotes and coins were also revised accordingly .
In order to improve availability , direct remittances were increasingly sent to various currency chests from the printing presses .
More than 100 direct remittances were sent to currency chests in various issue circles .
Keeping in view the necessity for urgent and timely supply of notes across the country , notes were also air lifted from presses / regional offices of the Reserve Bank to various centres as well as directly to currency chests , wherever possible .
Banks managing the currency chests were allowed to make inter-circle diversions at their discretion to even out cash availability .
In order to decongest the accumulation of SBNs at bank branches , a Guarantee Scheme was re-initiated at Reserve Bank offices and a new scheme at the district level was introduced , whereunder bank branches ( other than those of DCCBs ) not linked to any currency chest were advised to deposit the SBNs with them in any Issue Office of the Reserve Bank or a currency chest on or before December 31 , 2016 .
Keeping in view the urgent need for making available adequate cash to all parts of the country at the shortest possible time , concerted efforts were made by the Reserve Bank and the printing presses to augment the production and supply of bank notes .
Reflecting these measures , total NiC increased rapidly to ₹ 15.06 trillion as on June 30 , 2017 , which was about 85 per cent of the NiC as to progress at a steady pace with enhanced focus on printing and distribution to meet the currency demand .
While there was no monetary limit for deposit of SBNs for eligible resident Indians , the limit for NRIs was fixed at ₹ 25,000 in line with the relevant regulation under the Foreign Exchange Management Act ( FEMA ) .
The facility was provided at five Reserve Bank offices ( Mumbai , New Delhi , Chennai , Kolkata , and Nagpur ) subject to verification of documents including customs certification evidencing import of the SBNs ( for NRIs ) and copies of bank account statements .
The Government of India subsequently issued two Gazette notifications , viz . , Specified Bank Notes ( Deposit of Confiscated Notes ) Rules , Notes ( Deposit by Banks , Post Offices and District Central Co-operative Banks ) Rules , 2017 dated confiscated / seized by law enforcement agencies post offices and district central co-operative banks which could not deposit the SBNs at the Reserve Bank / currency chests before December 30 , 2016 were allowed .
BRBNMPL is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank , which is playing a crucial role in the indigenisation of security features of banknotes in India .
The Reserve Bank infused ₹ 10 billion of capital into BRBNMPL during 2016-17 for setting up of a security ink factory at Mysuru , upgradation / acquisition of machines , etc .
The processing and destruction of SBNs deposited / exchanged by the public and kept in various currency chests and regional offices of the Reserve Bank pose a challenge .
In this regard , the agenda for 2017-18 includes the procurement of Currency Verification and Processing System ( CVPS ) / Shredding and _ Briquetting Systems ( SBS ) ; introduction of new series banknotes in other denominations ; procurement of security features ; and introduction of varnished banknotes .
Settlement of Collateralised Borrowing and Lending Obligation ( CBLO ) , Government securities clearing and forex transactions are through the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd .
Consequent to total cheque volume migrating to the cheque truncation system ( CTS ) , there is no Magnetic Ink Character Recognition ( MICR ) Cheque Processing Centre ( CPC ) location in the country as of now .
The National Automated Clearing House ( NACH ) system was started by the National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) on December 29 , 2012 , to facilitate inter-bank , high volume , electronic transactions which are repetitive and periodic in nature .
The number of non-bank entities were permitted to provide mobile banking services authorised for operating PPIs increased to 55 with up to end-June 2017 .
While 54 banks operate WLAs , deployed 14,121 WLAs by end- were granted approval to issue PPIs , 289 banks March 2017 .
In the Payment and Settlement Systems in India : Vision 2018 , the department had identified four strategic pillars for achieving its vision .
The developments in each of the areas are detailed below .
Non-adherence to guidelines and standards for payment and settlement systems under the Payment and Settlement Systems ( PSS ) Act , 2007 can attract penal provisions .
The growing usage of PPls has led to requests from stakeholders for relaxations in certain areas while strengthening the norms for safety and security , risk mitigation and customer protection .
Accordingly , PPI guidelines were comprehensively reviewed and draft Master Directions on issuance and operation of PPls were placed on the Bank ' s website on March 20 , 2017 for public comments by April 15 , 2017 .
The Bank has adopted the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures ( PFMIs ) for regulation and supervision of FMls .
Accordingly , Central Counterparties ( CCPs ) being a critical component should have sound _ financials , particularly in terms of sufficient shareholders ' funds to cover potential business losses in order to continue providing services as a going concern .
The Bank is , therefore , in the process of issuing more specific directions on ( i ) net worth requirement for CCPs , ( ii ) broad principles underlying governance of CCPs and ( iii ) more clarity on foreign-regulated CCPs desirous of operating in India .
PSAC was to be constituted as an advisory body to the Board for Regulation and Supervision of Payment and Settlement Systems ( BPSS ) .
Since the Payments Regulatory Board ( PRB ) is envisaged to replace the BPSS as per the Finance Bill , 2017 , no further action is being taken on the formation of PSAC .
The Bank decided to implement the LEI system for all participants in the Over-the-Counter ( OTC ) markets for Rupee interest rate derivatives , foreign currency derivatives and credit derivatives in India .
The clearing corporations currently settle funds-leg of trades executed on stock exchanges in accounts with various designated commercial banks which are their clearing banks .
The RBI-SEBI Working Group on ' Replacement of Commercial Bank Settlement Model with Central Bank Settlement Model for Securities Market ' recommended that funds leg involving commercial banks and clearing corporations could be settled in central bank money .
Steps have been undertaken to implement funds settlement of all such securities and commodity market transactions in central bank money .
In-principle authorisation was _ granted to NPCI to function as a Bharat Bill Payment Central Unit ( BBPCU ) of the BBPS , a pan-India inter-operable bill payment system .
Up to end- June 2017 , a total of 70 entities , both banks and non-banks were granted in-principle approval to operate as Bharat Bill Payment Operating Units ( BBPOUs ) .
Pilot operations of BBPS have been launched in August 2016 and 37 billers under the current scope of BBPS related to electricity , gas , telecom , DTH and water are participating .
TReDS is an institutional mechanism for facilitating the financing of trade receivables of Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises ( MSMEs ) from corporate buyers through multiple financiers .
All the three entities that had received in-principle approval to set up and operate TReDS have been issued Certificate of Authorisation .
With a view to encouraging a wider segment of merchants to accept card payments , a merchant turnover-based MDR structure for debit card transactions has been proposed in place of the existing slab-rate MDR based on transaction value .
Towards electronification of toll collection systems on pan-India basis in an inter-operable environment , in-principle approval was granted to NPCI for setting up and operating a National Electronic Toll Collection ( NETC ) system .
The final approval to NPCI for the NETC project is envisaged to be accorded in the coming year , based on results of the pilot project being undertaken .
The Bank ' s policy document , " Regulation and Supervision of FMI regulated by RBI states that the Bank would assess / review the FMls operated by it against the international standards with the same rigour as other FMls .
Guided by this policy , a detailed assessment of RTGS against the PFMls was carried out during the year .
Apart from the _ initiatives already mentioned , the following policy measures were initiated during the year to promote digital a . Unified Payments Interface ( UPI ) NPCI was given approval to go live for UPI during the year .
National Unified USSD Platform ( * 99 # NUUP Data ) NPCI was permitted to introduce Unstructured Supplementary Service Data ( USSD ) 2.0 ( * 99 # ) version which was also integrated with the UPI , so as to provide a better customer experience for funds transfers .
BHIM-Aadhaar Pay Mechanism for Merchant To provide a channel for customers to make digital payments using their Aadhaar-seeded bank accounts at merchant locations , in- principle approval was accorded to NPCI to launch a pilot on BHIM-Aadhaar Pay .
BHIM-Aadhaar Pay is a smart phone- based application with a dongle attached to it for capture of customers biometric data .
The customer will authenticate the payment transaction by providing biometric identification on the merchant device .
These transactions are processed as part of the existing Aadhaar Enabled Payment System ( AEPS ) with a separate transaction type assigned to them .
Tokenised Contactless Card Payments Approval was given to the authorised card networks to introduce tokenised contactless card payments such as ' Samsung Pay ' .
With the use of digital payment channels under focus , the Bank started collating daily data of select electronic payment systems , representative data on credit / debit card usage , PPI and mobile banking , and disseminating them on its website on a weekly basis .
The Bank reviewed the access criteria for payment system and issued a master direction on it taking into account the developments following the earlier instructions issued in September 2011 .
Customer convenience was _ enhanced through rationalisation of the mandate for an additional factor of authentication for card not present transactions using network provided solutions for payments up to ₹ 2,000 .
The audit would cover compliance as per security best practices , change management aspects for the system authorised and adherence to the process flow approved by the Bank .
One of the major objectives of the Vision-2018 for the payment and settlement systems in India is to ensure inter-operability among the different service providers of a payment system .
Accordingly , all authorised card networks were advised in September 2016 to standardise the QR code , enabling inter-operability of transactions .
The inter-operable QR code ( Bharat QR ) was launched in February 2017 .
CCIL was one of the ten CCPs reviewed as part of the level-3 assessment .
During the year , a compliance audit of CCIL was carried out to assess its compliance with the observations in the Bank ' s inspection undertaken in the previous year .
As a measure of enhanced transparency , CCIL continued to disclose its self-assessment on its compliance with the PFMIs on an annual basis , as per the ' Disclosure Framework and Assessment Methodology ' , prescribed in the PFMls .
CCIL also publishes its quantitative disclosures on a quarterly basis as per the public disclosure standards for CCPs .
The European Commission has observed that India has regulatory regimes for the CCPs equivalent to the European Union .
Consequent to the European Commission ' s equivalence decision under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation ( EMIR ) , a Memorandum of Understanding ( MoU ) was executed as part of cooperation between the Reserve Bank and the European Securities and Market Authority ( ESMA ) .
The ESMA has included CCIL in its list of recognised CCPs and also advised CCIL as a third country CCP .
During the year , onsite inspection of 13 PPls and three White Label ATM Operators was carried out .
Towards meeting the currency requirements of the public through ATMs , a Task Force for Recalibration of ATMs was set up under the Chairmanship of Shri S. S. Mundra , Deputy Governor , comprising representatives from the Ministry of Finance , Ministry of Home Affairs , four banks with the largest ATM networks and NPCI .
As decided by the Task Force , coordinated efforts of the ATM manufacturers , cash replenishment agencies and service providers were made to recalibrate and replenish the ATMs for dispensing new series of high denomination bank notes .
By end-December 2016 , with over 1.90 lakh ATMs recalibrated , the Task Force was wound up .
ATM charges for all transactions by savings bank customers were waived for both on-us and off-us transactions from November 10 , 2016 till December 30 , 2016 .
Cash withdrawal limits at POS were enhanced up to ₹ 2000 per day across all centres ( Tier | to VI ) and customer charges were waived on all such transactions from The participating banks and PPI issuers of IMPS , UPI and USSD were advised not to levy charges on transactions up to ~ 1000 For debit card transactions during January- March 2017 , MDR was capped at 0.25 per cent for transactions up to ₹ 1000 and 0.5 per cent for transactions above ₹ 1000 and up to ₹ 2000 .
The timeline was subsequently extended till completion of review of the MDR guidelines .
The report states that DLT is viewed by many as having the potential to disrupt payment , clearing , settlement and related activities .
DLT , including block chain technology , draws upon both well established and newer technologies to operate a set of synchronised ledgers managed by one or more entities .
DLT may provide an alternative to the traditional centralisation of database management , as is the case with financial market infrastructures ( FMls ) .
The report highlights how DLT could enhance efficiency by radically changing the processes of maintaining and storing of assets , how obligations are discharged , contracts are enforced , and risks are managed .
The features of DLT could transform financial services and markets by reducing complexity , improving end-to-end processing speed , increasing transparency and improving immutability in transaction record keeping and network resilience , reducing operational and financial risks .
This could largely reduce the need for reconciliation across multiple record-keeping infrastructures .
However , DLT may pose new or different risks concomitant to operational and security issues arising from the technology , lack of inter-operability with existing processes and infrastructures and issues related to data integrity , immutability and privacy .
As DLT is an evolving technology that has not yet been proven sufficiently robust for wide scale implementation , implementing across jurisdictions draws its own challenges on legal aspects .
Having a well-founded , clear , transparent and enforceable legal basis is a core element of payment , clearing , and settlement arrangements .
DLT can increase legal risks if there is ambiguity or lack of certainty about an arrangement ' s legal basis .
For transactions taking place across borders or in multiple jurisdictions , the law underpinning the activity would need to be confirmed or adopted in multiple jurisdictions in ways that are mutually compatible .
With in- built tools of configuration on assessing macro-economic factors , automatic triggering of margin calls across FMls in the system simultaneously may pose challenges on liquidity demand and its management in the system .
A number of financial market participants are assessing the possibility of using DLT for specific post-trade processes , from maintaining basic records to clearing and settling financial transactions .
Their inclination towards DLT is driven by factoring efficiency gains from cost savings , faster settlement , greater resiliency and quicker reconciliation from the use of an automatically updated source of consistent information along the value chain .
Market participants involved in post-trade processes are exploring the realisation of efficiencies through collectively maintaining a common , decentralised record of data , eliminating the need to reconcile different databases , which could be possible through DLT .
In the Indian context , a Proof-of-Concept ( PoC ) was structured and customised by the IDRBT to facilitate the feasibility analysis of blockchain technology for Indian banking and finance sector with two use cases that highlight banking and consumer interaction : domestic trade finance with a sight letter of credit and Enhanced Information Payments ( EIP ) .
Overall , the PoC provided a good demonstration of the use-cases and helped to broaden the understanding of the technology and its potential to other real-life applications , but scalability and security aspects need to be studied in detail .
Bank for International Settlements ( 2017 ) , Report of the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures on " Distributed Ledger Technology in Payment , Clearing and Settlement , " February .
Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology ( 2017 ) , White Paper on " Applications of Blockchain Technology to Banking and Financial Sector in India ' , January .
Further , issuance of PPls by banks was allowed to various entities including unlisted corporates / partnership firms / sole proprietorship / public organisations like municipal corporations and urban local bodies for onward issuance of PPIs to their staff / employees / contract workers .
White Label ATM Operators ( WLAOs ) were allowed to source cash from retail outlets , provided that the quality and genuineness of currency notes , thus sourced , would be the responsibility of WLAOs .
Thescope of activities of WLAO , introduced in June 2012 , were reviewed from time to time , inter alia , enabling the acceptance of international cards atWLAs , facilitating use of dynamic currency conversion for international cards , delinking cash supply from sponsor banks , and sourcing of cash from retail outlets .
Nonetheless , WLAOs have not been able to meet the stipulated targets under the schemes chosen by them .
Hence , it has been decided to review the WLA guidelines comprehensively , particularly from the perspective of WLA deployment targets .
A review of the policy for granting permission to banks for mobile banking and prescribing minimum security standards would be undertaken .
In view of the thrust on digital payments , the draft Master Directions on issuance and operation of PPls in India of March 20 , 2017 envisaged inter-operability among PPIs in line with the Vision-2018 .
Instructions on implementation of inter-operability among PPIs , in a phased manner , would be issued after the finalisation of the PPI guidelines .
Cheque issuing banks are required to make all efforts to withdraw non-CTS 2010 standard cheques in circulation by creating awareness among customers .
Accordingly , the volume of non- CTS-2010 cheques to total inward volume was brought down to below 1 per cent in 2016 from 4 per cent in 2014 .
The requirement of paper to follow for cheques issued by the central government was also discontinued .
Further measures would be undertaken to facilitate migration of cheques to CTS-2010 standards .
The framework would draw from the principle that the intensity of oversight should be proportionate to the systemic risks or system-wide risks posed by a payment system or operator or participant .
In this connection , the templates to collect data from entities would be enhanced to include more granular details and new reporting templates would be added to facilitate the collection of detailed information from regulated entities .
In the present scenario , different payment systems have different processes in place for customer grievance redressals .
The Bank would undertake measures for their harmonisation to ensure uniformity in processes and timeframe for resolution .
Towards further transparency in the payments space , the Bank would initiate measures to ensure that the PSOs clearly disclose the fees and terms and conditions of their services to the customers .
With the increasing volume of transactions in NEFT , this feature needs to be strengthened across all participating banks as envisaged in Vision-2018 .
The Bank would incorporate a similar feature of positive confirmation for RTGS transactions .
The main focus of DIT continued on providing robust technology _ infrastructure to ensure smooth running of the critical and systemically important payment and settlement systems in the country as also of the other IT systems for use by the Reserve Bank .
The Integrated Computerised Currency Operations Management System ( ICCOMS ) , used by the Reserve Bank for currency management is being brought under the Bank ' s CBS , e-Kuber .
The enhancement to e-Kuber would enable the Bank to have a near real-time view of the balances in the currency chests and facilitate efficient management of currency .
A granular view of the currency chest transactions would also help to optimise the holdings of the currency chests .
The system is being designed to facilitate automation of processes and integration with machines like currency verification processing system , note counting machines and kiosks .
The system would also have linkage with Note Presses and provision to track currency in transit .
The Reserve Bank ' s e-Kuber system has been assigned the responsibility of functioning as the ' aggregator ' for all-India collections under Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) regime .
It would also be a one stop source of data reporting to GST Network ( GSTN ) , state governments and the Central Board of Excise and Customs ( CBEC ) , the nodal government department for its implementation .
As GST will be a pan-India taxation system , large quantum of transaction data will be handled by e-Kuber .
The system follows ISO 20022 secured messaging protocols for interaction among agency banks , nodal government departments and GSTN , thereby facilitating exchange of information between CBS of banks and e-Kuber of the Reserve Bank .
The system also provides for automatic reconciliation of differences among ' stakeholders using Memorandum of Errors using ISO messaging protocols .
The standardised e-receipt and e-payment model was rolled out for various state and central government departments .
This standardised model envisages integration of governments and banks ' systems with e-Kuber for online transaction-wise reporting of receipts / payments on behalf of government departments by bank branches .
The e-scrolls and account statements are delivered electronically to governments in a straight-through-processing ( STP ) manner in ISO format for consumption by their treasuries .
The e-receipt system has been adopted by 14 state governments till end-June 2017 .
The e-payment model envisages integration of government departments with the e-Kuber system for making direct payments to beneficiaries through NEFT .
The payment e-scrolls and the account statements in ISO formats are sent to the treasuries for further use at their end .
The objective is to ensure digitisation of the entire work flow processes so as to enhance efficiency through business process re-engineering ( BPR ) , monitoring of work flow and also reducing storage and retrieval time for documents .
In order to have a holistic approach towards monitoring the performance of high quality services in support of IT applications , the EMS solution is being implemented at the Data Centres for enhancing operational efficiency .
The tools constantly monitor health of the servers , network links , middleware and applications based on pre-set threshold values .
The system generates alerts when thresholds are breached .
The tools also facilitate service call logging , call escalation , incident reporting and monitoring .
In addition , it builds knowledge base of the service tickets and enforcement of all processes related to change management , incident management , etc .
The information security policy of the Reserve Bank is revised periodically to ensure continued protection against the changing contours of security threats .
With the emerging threat landscape , where organised cybercrime and cyber warfare are taking prominence , the information security and cyber security policy of the Reserve Bank for its own information systems is being reviewed .
The emphasis will be placed on recognising the growing use of mobile devices and also the new forms of attacks reported worldwide and to provide protection against these risks .
The Reserve Bank has _ deployed Information Technology ( IT ) products , applications and services hosted in its Data Centres .
However , with advanced , persistent and innovative threats surfacing every day , the security of IT infrastructure has to be monitored in a holistic manner .
In this direction , as part of the Bank ' s cyber security reinforcement measures , an Information Security Operation Centre ( iSOC ) has been made operational to monitor , detect , prevent and mitigate various types of information and cyber security risks .
Alerts received from various sources are promptly taken cognisance of and suitable action is initiated .
As part of the efforts aimed at accessibility of the information systems and to enable improved responsiveness to electronic communication , the Wireless Local Area Network ( WLAN ) systems with the Wireless Intrusion Prevention System ( WIPS ) were successfully installed and made operational initially at some of the major office buildings and in training establishments .
The currency management modules in e-Kuber are expected to be made operational by March 2018 .
EDMS is being rolled out in a phased manner in all the offices of the Reserve Bank and is expected to be fully functional by December 2017 .
A roadmap to integrate other internal communication systems with the EDMS has been worked out and will be taken up after the initial modules are fully rolled out .
ReBIT will commence its full-fledged operations and assist the Reserve Bank in cyber security related areas during 2017-18 .
As far as statistics and information management is concerned , the coverage of the SAARCFINANCE database that has been developed in-house , was enhanced , while the formats of eXtensible Business Reporting Language ( XBRL ) -based returns for submissions by banks were streamlined and a technical guidance note on these returns was issued for ensuing quality and uniformity .
In addition , a nowcasting exercise was undertaken incorporating sentiments captured from news articles with the application of latest technological innovations like web-scrapping .
In the international arena , Bank ' s notable achievements include effective coordination of the Financial Sector Assessment Program ( FSAP ) .
Besides , as Chair of BRICS and as co-chair of the G-20 Framework Working Group ( FWG ) , several related events were organised even as the country position on a range of international financial architecture ( IFA ) issues in the G-20 IFA Working Group , was mooted .

The Reserve Bank endeavours to strike a chord with the public through communication that is dynamic , evolving and responsive to domestic and _ international developments .
The website of the Reserve Bank is also integrated with two social media sites - Twitter to send alerts for press releases and YouTube conferences of the top management including post-policy press conferences and _ financial education films produced by the Reserve Bank .
As at end-June 2017 , the Reserve Bank ' s Twitter account had over 2.5 lakh followers and YouTube had over 11,000 subscribers .
The Governor ' s post-policy conferences on the bi-monthly statements on monetary policy were disseminated through YouTube along with live streaming on the Reserve Bank ' s website and business television channels .
The audio and transcripts of the press conferences were uploaded on the Bank ' s website .
The minutes of MPC meetings were uploaded on the website of the Reserve Bank on the 14 day after every meeting of the MPC as provided under Section 45ZL of the RBI Act , 1934 .
The message aimed to alert the public about fraudulent offers of cheap funds through lottery wins and job offers while seeking account and card details .
The campaign also focused on educating the common man on various banking facilities that are available .
These advertisements were issued in 660 newspapers on November 09 , 2016 .
In the second round , a combined advertisement on the security features of ₹ 500 and ₹ 2000 notes was published in Hindi and vernacular languages more round of advertisements on currency was issued on November 12 , 2016 .
All the communications issued to banks on the withdrawal of SBNs were promptly posted on the Bank ' s website under a separate heading titled ' All You Wanted to Know from RBI about Withdrawal of Legal Tender Status of ₹ 500 and ₹ 1000 Notes ' with notifications to banks , press releases , data releases and Frequently Asked Questions ( FAQs ) clearly segregated for ease of reference .
Under the Depositors Education and Awareness ( DEA ) Fund Scheme , the Reserve Bank released an advertisement for creating awareness on KYC updation in bank accounts in 114 newspapers in 14 languages between September 02 and September 04 , 2016 .
A pilot programme was conducted in rural areas to create awareness on select topics like Business Correspondents , insurance , responsible borrowing , nomination , investment in unscrupulous entities , Banking Ombudsman and KYC .
The 10-day campaign was conducted in four districts of Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh , covering about 200 villages .
The main takeaways from the campaign included continued supply- side constraints in the form of server downtime , inadequate ATMs , printers , etc .
One more pilot project for public awareness was done through displays on 30 BEST buses in Mumbai for one month .
The messages included awareness on KYC updation as well as cautioning the public against fictitious mails .
The workshop was also attended by Hindi and Marathi mediapersons .
The Reserve Bank has been focusing on increasing consumer awareness on banking services , regulations and consumer protection matters .
As part of these efforts , DoC , in coordination with other stakeholder departments of the Bank , will extend the pan-India mass media public awareness campaign across all media to cover more segments of the public .
The speed with which messages can go viral on social media has made them virtually impossible to be ignored as a medium of communication even for central banks .
Central banks are , therefore , opening up gradually and cautiously and increasingly using social media to connect with the public and making their presence felt in public domain .
The study revealed that to start with , - Central banks prefer to disseminate the information available on their websites in the form of a really simple syndication ( RSS ) feed or an e-mail alert .
Most of the central banks ( 22 of the 24 ) use Twitter to send alerts for information already disseminated through the website .
Barring a few , most of them do not respond to tweets posted by general public .
YouTube is the third most popular social media used , with 18 of the 24 central banks using it primarily for consumer awareness and education .
Facebook is also popular media used to connect with people with 15 of the 24 central banks using the same .
To connect with the youth , some of the central banks use LinkedIn , Instagram and Flickr .
In particular , select central banks used Facebook to directly interact with students .
The Bank of England has a presence on relatively less popular platforms like Pinterest ( personalised social platform ) , Podcast ( for broadcasting news and announcements on ipods ) and Soundcloud ( medium for distributing audio content ) , apart from its active presence in most of the popular social media .
Further , the Bank of England also carries out various public awareness programmes and quizzes for students on social media like Facebook ; and participants are rewarded with attractive prizes and gifts .
On the contrary , the Bank of Japan has a minimal social media presence ( only on Twitter ) .
YouTube is more popular among developing countries to create awareness and clarify concepts about the functioning of the central banks .
In particular , African countries have shown remarkable presence on social media .
Some central banks , including the Reserve Bank , use MobileApp to stay engaged with the public .
The Bank of England uses the App guide for checking banknotes .
It provides an interactive guide on security features of the current Bank of England currency notes .
Federal Reserve ' s App provides users latest insights into the state of the economy and provides information , such as , press releases and notifications .
ECBstatsApp is an App that allows one access to the statistics compiled by the European Central Bank ( ECB ) assisted by various national central banks .
The Czech National Bank ' s official App informs users about all valid Czech banknotes and coins and the protective elements they contain .
The official Bank Negara Malaysia mobile App disseminates the central bank ' s latest news and announcements , foreign exchange rates , fraud alerts , watch lists and many other user friendly features for the benefit of the public .
It also helps the employees in attaining personal growth and in improving their effectiveness at work .
The six training establishments of the Bank , viz . , Reserve Bank Staff College ( RBSC ) , Chennai ; College of Agricultural Banking ( CAB ) , Pune ; and four Zonal Training Centres in Mumbai , New Delhi , Kolkata and Chennai , cater to its training requirements ( Table X.1 ) .
Under the Golden Jubilee Scholarship Scheme , seven officers were selected during the year to pursue higher studies in reputed universities abroad .
This will be an ongoing process with newer modules being prepared and hosted on the Learning Management System of the Bank .
At present nine e-learning modules are being offered by the RBSC on the Bank ' s intranet .
During the course of the year , 129 students were selected and provided internship in the Bank as part of the summer internship scheme .
The RBI Academy was launched on September 26 , 2016 with a specialised programme on corporate finance conducted in collaboration with IIM , Anmedabad .
Thereafter , it has conducted basic programmes on macroeconomics , microeconomics , faculty development programme , two programmes each on fundamentals and advance courses of IS audit and assurance , and a programme on Big Data .
The participants were from the Reserve Bank , commercial banks and SEBI .

During 2016-17 , the Unit initiated several policy notes in varied areas including real sector , financial markets , investment situation , fiscal position and the external sector .
Besides the regular surveillance and market intelligence related work , the Unit also conducted a number of mid-term projects that looked into issues related to urban co- operative banks , India ' s equilibrium exchange rate , export elasticity , forex interventions , adequacy of forex reserves and household finance .
In addition to the above , SRU was involved in cutting edge research projects that delved into the areas of food security , public infrastructure , fiscal consolidation , and inflation dynamics .
Several of these studies have already been published or accepted for publication in notable journals .
Several such seminars were organised during the year wherein eminent professors , experts and market participants from finance and economics delivered lectures or presented their research findings .
The Unit will continue its monitoring and market intelligence work and present the same as inputs to policy making .
It would undertake research in areas of strategic and contemporary interest across various verticals of the Reserve Bank .
It would also continue to disseminate research inputs through seminars and publications .
The Enterprise-wide Risk Management ( ERM ) framework was adopted by the Reserve Bank in February 2012 to develop an integrated assessment and management of its risk exposures .
A three-phase roll out of the ERM framework was envisaged .
The first phase included the development of methodologies and tools for identification , assessment and reporting of financial and non-financial risks as well as building an institutional memory of ' Incidents ' !
The second phase envisages a quantitative assessment of operational risk ( OR ) and articulation of Bank ' s risk appetite for reserve management and risk tolerance level for operational risk ;
Central banks were no exception to this trend , as some of the leading ones from the advanced economies had acquired considerable financial risk on their balance sheets due to the qualitative and quantitative easing operations .
While the Reserve Bank did not see a slippage in the quality of its balance sheet due to the GFC , it proactively strengthened its internal risk control framework by implementing a phased rollout of the ERM framework in 2012 .
As a part of this phased approach , the Reserve Bank is in the process of putting in place a RTF whereby its governance structure will formally articulate its attitude to risk , and the nature and extent of risk that it is willing to accept in pursuit of its mission , vision , business objectives and overall strategic goals .
Strategically , this is a key framework given that while the Reserve Bank is a risk-sensitive institution , it also recognises that it is exposed to various types of risks including policy , strategic , reputational , financial , and operational , in the pursuit of its core objectives ( particularly those of fostering monetary and financial stability ) , which need to be managed effectively .
RTF , as being implemented in the Reserve Bank , has the i . Risk Tolerance Statement : which is a formal articulation of the organisation ' s risk philosophy and attitude to risk .
The Reserve Bank is now seen to be among select central banks , which have formally articulated their ' risk
Risk Tolerance Limits ( RTLs ) : which are a series of limits meant to ensure that the Bank ' s operations are carried out in conformity with its articulated risk tolerances ;
Incident is an occurrence that is not covered by or violates extant instructions / policies / procedures .
It includes events that cause loss to the Bank or hinder the achievement of the Bank ' s objectives or raise the scope of such loss / hindrance .
Near Misses is an incident which was not prevented by internal controls but did not result in actual or adverse impact either due to chance or other external factors .
Fostering a risk culture in the organisation by , inter alia , sensitising the staff at all levels , is considered crucial for achieving a shared understanding of the Bank ' s attitude to risk and for creating an enabling environment for viewing errors as a learning experience , even as risk reporting facilitates timely mitigating interventions to avert losses .
In order to facilitate the development of the ' loss ' database , which is also a prerequisite for the quantification of the Bank ' s operational risk , a user-friendly software has been implemented for the reporting of Incidents by BUs .
However , the controls implemented by BU to prevent the recurrence of the risk event / s are assessed during audit and the absence ( or ineffectiveness ) of requisite controls can be included as ( iii ) Unreported risk events , identified during the audit , are included as audit observations , which consequently , also have an impact on the overall risk profile .
These include conducting a number of seminars to sensitise the officers on ERM ; designating two Risk Officers ( over 100 in all ) in each BU to help foster a risk culture in their respective units ; and developing case studies of unique / ncidents for placing them on the Bank ' s intranet and making these available to the TEs ; ( v ) The universe of the reporters has been widened on a pilot basis for a few CODs and ROs to permit any officer of these BUs to intimate an incident , directly to the RMD through a simplified reporting template that has been placed on the Bank ' s intranet portal .
The framework also provides for ensuring the confidentiality of the reporter ' s identity .
The foregoing measures have helped in enhancing risk awareness and improving risk reporting in the Bank .
Business Unit refers to the reporting Central Office Department , Regional Office or Training Establishment of the RBI .
the Bank have been provided exposure to the ERM framework , over 100 designated Risk Officers spread across all the Central Office Departments ( CODs ) , ROs and Training Establishments ( TEs ) have also been intensively trained .
The seminars / conferences have benefitted from the ' tone from the top ' provided by the involvement of the top management in reinforcing the risk culture in the organisation .
The lnternational Operational Risk Working Group ( lIORWG ) , a forum of 69 central banks and the BIS , has a well-defined process for identifying best practices in various aspects of operational risk management in central banks .
CBRMC was launched under the aegis of the BIS in 2004 and has since been hosted by various central banks around the world .
This edition of the conference was attended by senior risk officials from 31 central banks and the BIS , and focused on the economic capital framework as its central theme .
The Reserve Bank has , at the invitation of the BIS , joined the steering group of the forum .
Immediately following the CBRMC , a two- day European Central Bank ( ECB ) -RBI technical cooperation workshop on risk management was also organised on November 21-22 , 2016 in Mumbai , as per the MoU signed between the ECB and the Reserve Bank in January 2015 .
RMD has launched a project along with the Inspection Department for developing a web- enabled risk reporting and analysis platform , viz . , Audit Management and Risk Monitoring System ( AMRMS ) .
This project in the form of software , once operationalised , will , inter alia , enable greater convergence of risk assessment by the internal audit function with that of the risk monitoring function through its Risk Assessment Methodology for Operational Risk ( RAM-OR ) , by providing an on-screen comparison of risk ratings under the two methodologies .
This is expected to bring about a higher degree of objectivity and consistency in the risk assessment process within the Bank through a harmonised risk-rating framework .
RRs have been prepared for each BA of the Bank and upon finalisation of all of them , a composite view of the operational risk profile for the entire Bank will be available .
As regards the measurement of financial risk exposures of the Bank , the Economic Capital Framework , already in place , provides an ongoing balance-sheet-wide monitoring mechanism therefor , and enables an informed decision on building up the requisite level of financial buffers against such exposures .
Internal audit / inspection undertaken by the Inspection Department of the Reserve Bank provides risk assurance to the top management .
The inspections are conducted under the Risk Based Internal Audit ( RBIA ) framework wherein internal control and governance processes are examined by a team consisting of Principal Inspecting Officer , Inspecting Officers and information systems ( IS ) Auditors .
The Inspection Department also provides support to the Audit and Risk Management Sub-Committee ( ARMS ) of the Central Board as also to the Executive Directors ' Committee ( EDC ) overseeing the internal audit function .
The implementation of Audit Management and Risk Monitoring System ( AMRMS ) is in an advanced stage .
A parallel run of the RBIA module was underway and was to go live by July 2017 .
VA-PT of the video conferencing ( VC ) system was undertaken and the audit report has been submitted .
In addition , VA-PT / technology audit of the Next Generation Real Time Gross Settlement ( NG-RTGS ) system was also undertaken and the draft audit report has been submitted .
The scope of AMRMS includes automating RBIA and other audit modules such as vertical audit , control self-assessment audit ( CSAA ) , scrutinies and technology audit along with other supplementary audit functions .
A host of benefits will accrue due to AMRMS being a centralised web-based application accessible from any RBI office .
The International Department has the mandate of monitoring global developments , conducting international policy analysis and fostering international cooperation at various international fora such as G-20 , BRICS , SAARC , BIS , FSB and IMF .
The apogee of the department ' s work during the year was the effective coordination of the Financial Sector Assessment Program ( FSAP ) for India .
Being Chair of BRICS , India hosted several BRICS events during 2016 , including the Eighth BRICS summit in Goa in October .
On the eve of the summit , the Reserve Bank co-hosted the first BRICS Economic Forum Seminar and the BRICS Finance Ministers ' and Central Bank Governors ' ( FM & CBG ) Meeting .
It also worked with other members to set up a system of macroeconomic information exchange .
With India co-chairing the G-20 Framework Working Group ( FWG ) , its meeting at Varanasi was successfully co-hosted with the Ministry of Finance during March 28-29 , 2017 .
The department worked in close collaboration with the government for shaping India ' s growth strategy for the G-20 Hangzhou Action Plan in 2016 and the Hamburg Action Plan in 2017 .
Under the German Presidency , India played a lead role in shaping up a set of resilience principles in the area of private finance , external sector and monetary policy , which were endorsed at the G-20 FM & CBG meeting .
As future consumption can be bought through such trade by postponing current consumption or vice versa , it allows economic entities to smooth consumption inter-temporally ( Lewis and Liu 2015 ) .
Bhagwati ( 1998 ) argued that claims of enormous benefits from free capital mobility across borders were not persuasive .
In this backdrop , it would be of interest to look at the approaches of the two main international organisations dealing with capital account liberalisation ( CAL ) , viz . , the OECD and the IMF .
OECD ' s views are reflected in its two codes introduced in 1961 , viz . , the Code on Liberalisation of Capital Movements ( generally known as the OECD Code ) and the Code of Liberalisation of Current Invisible Operations .
The codes aim at encouraging members to progressively remove barriers to capital movements in quest for faster growth .
In 1992 , short-term capital movements were covered under the code , thus limiting the scope for capital flow management measures ( CFMs ) .
In 2002 , restrictions on overseas portfolio investment were made untenable under the code .
Before the onset of the Asian financial crisis , there were moves to recognise capital account convertibility as an explicit goal .
However , the overwhelming evidence from the Asian financial crisis forced IMF to backtrack .
Accordingly , gradualism , with some CFMs and macroprudential measures ( MPMs ) , were deemed as a legitimate policy for emerging markets to exercise .
The IMF ' s Independent Evaluation Office ( IEO ) also noted in 2015 that empirical literature was unable to establish a robust positive relationship between CAL and growth .
Cross-border spill- overs of capital flows have since increased and the G-20 countries were urged to take them on board while dealing with national policies .
From an emerging market perspective , the IMF ' s approach appears prudent and pragmatic .
While the OECD Code may have served the advanced economies , emerging markets have demanded more flexibility in the codes as they do not sufficiently provide for CFMs or MPMs .
India has been of the view that adherence to the OECD code should remain a voluntary process , enabling members to decide on its appropriateness in the context of evolving macro- financial conditions .
While the OECD codes are currently under revision , G-20 has asked the IMF and the OECD to converge their views , especially with respect to MPMs .

The G-20 financial regulatory agenda during 2016-17 focused on assessment of effects of reforms with the FSB India took part in almost all the surveys , working on a structured framework for post implementation evaluation of effects of G-20 regulatory reforms .
Currently , Financial Stability Board ( FSB ) under the aegis of G-20 is focussing on the effects of reforms and presented its findings , predominantly for advanced economies ( AEs ) , in its second Annual Report , 2016 .
A key finding of FSB has been that bulk of adjustment to higher capital has taken place through accumulation of retained earnings rather than sharp adjustment through lending or asset growth , although some decline in risky lending for EU banks is observed .
In the Indian context , along with enhanced capital requirements , there has been an added issue of increase in non-performing assets ( NPAs ) since 2013 .
Notwithstanding this , banks ' capital to risk weighted assets ratio ( CRAR ) remained above the stipulated levels ( Chart 1 ) .
Further , a bank-wise analysis shows that banks with higher CRAR also have higher return on assets ( RoA ) although the degree of this positive relationship has slightly flattened in 2015 in the post Basel Ill phase .
On the market liquidity impact of the liquidity coverage ratio ( LCR ) since January 2015 , the FSB report concludes lack of any broad deterioration in market liquidity conditions .
However , some banks which were very close to the prescribed LCR appeared to have been impacted at the margin as reflected in call money rates , although not in volumes .
The FSB meeting on Analytical Group on Vulnerabilities was hosted in January 2017 .
The third seminar on the SAARCFINANCE database and the first meeting of the working group on SAARCFINANCE database were organised during November 17-18 , 2016 at the College of Agriculture Banking ( CAB ) , Pune .
In October 2016 , the SAARCFINANCE central bank Governors agreed on a road map on the areas of cooperation such as the cost of remittances within the region , banking regulation and supervision , financial inclusion , regional database , research studies , and capacity building .
While India remains insulated from such an impact , higher capital standards for GSIBs has had implications for trade finance .
Though the market share of foreign banks in India ' s international trade finance is on an average about 30 per cent , it has seen a declining trend in recent years ( Chart 3 ) .

In the wake of withdrawal of SBNs , there was an increase in the number of remittances in our remonetisation efforts resulting in higher freight and forwarding expenses .
For urgent supply of notes across the country , notes were also remitted by air resulting in increased expense on freight charges .
as the printing presses had to discontinue printing of ₹ 500 and ₹ 1000 denomination banknotes which were withdrawn in November 2016 .
This is primarily because of fall in depreciation expense due to introduction of monthly pro-rata depreciation from 2016-17 .
In 2016-17 , a provision of ₹ 0.50 billion was made for capital contribution in Reserve Bank Information Technology Pvt. Ltd . ( ReBIT ) and transferred to Asset Development Fund ( ADF ) and a provision of ₹ 131.40 billion was made for transfer to Contingency Fund ( CF ) .
The total contingent liabilities of the Bank amounted to ₹ 1,107.05 billion , the main components of which are ( a ) ₹ 1,105.79 billion towards the exposure of Bank in forwards and swaps ; and ( b ) the Bank holds partly paid shares , denominated in SDR , of Bank of International Settlements ( BIS ) .
The balances are callable at three months ' notice by a decision of the BIS Board of Directors .

In a milieu of a strengthening global economy , a cyclical rebound in world trade and generally buoyant financial markets , the Indian economy in 2017-18 turned in a resilient performance that was also entrenched in macroeconomic stability .
Although real GDP growth was somewhat slower than in the preceding year , the turnaround in capital formation and construction activity , together with record agricultural production , considerably brightens the near-term outlook .
The combination of ( i ) a steady easing of inflation for the fifth year in succession to undershoot the target in 2017-18 , ( ii ) a modest current account deficit of 1.9 per cent of GDP , and ( iii ) public finances having sturdily weathered the implementation of a major structural reform - the Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) , reinforces the prospects for 2018-19 .
On the downside , the firming profile of international commodity prices - especially of crude oil , spillovers from tightening global financial conditions , geo-political tensions , trade wars stirring up across borders , financial turbulence , and the overhang of impairment in domestic banking and corporate balance sheets , emerge as the key downside risks .
The year 2018-19 has commenced on an eventful note , with several of these risks materialising .
Aggregate domestic demand is also being supported by steadily strengthening investment - with a renewal of the capex cycle underway - and a strong pick-up in exports in Q1 .
India remains a preferred destination for foreign direct investment ( FDI ) .
The stage is set for the intensification of structural reforms that will unlock new growth energies and place the Indian economy on a sustainable trajectory of higher growth .
Against this backdrop , the rest of the chapter drills down into noteworthy developments that characterised the year gone by .
Drawing insights therefrom , a realisable outlook is etched out for 2018-19 and the near term .
The year 2017-18 turned out to be a year of inflexions in the growth path of the Indian economy , despite the lingering after-effects of demonetisation and the GST implementation .
Green shoots of recovery sprung up from Q2 , finding expression in a sequential rise in real GDP growth from a 13-quarter low of 5.6 per cent in Q1 to 7.7 per cent in Q4 .
On the supply side , agriculture posted an all-time high production of foodgrains and horticulture .
On top of this supply response , imports resulted in excess supply conditions in key crops such as rice , wheat , pulses and oil seeds , leading to prolonged deflation in the prices of pulses and oilseeds , and record buffer stock levels of rice and wheat - the highest in five years .
Infrastructure activity , which could be the force multiplier for India in the take-off to the middle income group of countries , gained pace in terms of projects under implementation , but new project announcements remained subdued across public and private sectors .
Furthermore , the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana ( GAUBHAGYA ) was launched with universal household electrification by March 2019 as its mission .
As regards the price situation , inflation eased to its lowest level in the new consumer price index ( CPI ) series in June 2017 , with food prices going into deflation .
Thereafter , a confluence of domestic and global developments pushed inflation up - an unseasonal spike in the prices of vegetables during October-November 2017 , disbursement of house rent allowance ( HRA ) for central government employees under the 7 Central Pay Commission ' s award and firming up of global commodity prices .
The delayed softening of food prices in Q4 brought relief as it got prolonged and in the event , the year ended with the lowest annual average inflation of 3.6 per cent since 2012-13 .
Turning to the setting of monetary policy , the significant fall in inflation excluding food and fuel during Q1 : 2017-18 and the dynamics of the output gap opened up space for the Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points ( bps ) in August 2017 .
Consistent with the monetary policy stance , liquidity management operations sought to modulate systemic liquidity from persisting surplus conditions to a position closer to neutrality .
Multiple instruments were deployed , including repo / reverse repo operations of various tenors under the liquidity adjustment facility , and outright open market operations .
Eventually , the liquidity situation turned into a deficit during February-March 2018 on account of moderation of government spending and large tax collections , resulting in the Reserve Bank briefly switching to an injection mode .
Monetary transmission from the policy rate to banks ' deposit and lending rates improved during 2017-18 , facilitated by the demonetisation-induced slosh of liquidity , but it remained uneven across sectors and bank groups .
In particular , the pace of reduction in lending rates for fresh rupee loans was impeded by asset quality concerns and _ risk-averse behaviour in lending activity .
As regards fiscal policy , the combined fiscal position of the centre and states deteriorated somewhat in relation to budgeted levels due to subdued growth in revenues and elevated revenue expenditure .
India ' s external sector remained resilient in 2017-18 despite a challenging global environment .
In contrast to developments in money , foreign exchange and fixed income markets , the bull run in the Indian equity market that commenced in the preceding year propelled the benchmark equity indices up by more than 10 per cent during 2017-18 .
After touching a peak in January 2018 , the market underwent significant correction during February-March 2018 on release of strong US jobs and inflation data , the consequent surge in US bond yields , and worries about trade war .
In the financial sector , dynamic changes in the Reserve Bank ' s balance sheet took place shaping monetary and financial conditions during the year .
Stressed assets [ gross non-performing assets ( GNPAs ) plus restructured standard advances ] in the banking system remained elevated at 12.1 per cent of gross advances at end-March 2018 .
Looking beyond the banking sector , non- banking financial companies ( NBFCs ) continued to post double-digit growth in 2017-18 , with improvement in profitability indicators , asset quality and even capital positions vis-a-vis the regulatory prescription of 15 per cent and minimum Tier 1 capital of 10 per cent from Deposit taking systematically important NBFCs ) and all deposit-taking NBFCs are required to maintain .
The Reserve Bank also decided to withdraw the exemption from regulatory and statutory provisions granted to government- owned NBFCs , bringing them on par with other NBFCs .
The global economy expanded at a strong pace in the first half of 2018 .
In this unsettled international environment , incoming data configure favourable conditions for an acceleration of activity in the Indian economy .
Keeping in view the evolving economic conditions , real GDP growth for 2018- 19 is expected to increase to 7.4 per cent from 6.7 per cent in the previous year , with risks evenly balanced .
Going forward , the up-tick in credit growth is likely to be supported by the progress being made under the aegis of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code , 2016 ( IBC ) in addressing stress on balance sheets of both corporates and banks , recapitalisation of PSBs , and a positive outlook on the economy .
The prevailing negative credit-to-GDP gap indicates that there is sufficient scope for credit absorption and expansion in bank lending on a sustained basis .
Headline inflation which averaged 4.8 per cent during Q1 : 2018-19 , is likely to face upside risks over the rest of the year from a number of sources , warranting continuous vigil and a readiness to head off those pressures from getting generalised .
The Union Budget for 2018-19 is confronted with an Occam ' s razor .
With regard to the fiscal position of states , budget estimates for 2018-19 have envisaged a revenue surplus and a lower fiscal deficit .
Global headwinds are likely to confront India ' s external sector in 2018-19 .
Even though exports have gathered momentum in Q1 of 2018- 19 , the worsening global trade environment as a result of protectionist policies may impinge upon external demand .
Several initiatives set in motion to secure the soundness of the banking system are expected to reach critical mass during 2018-19 .
Second , institutional reforms in India ' s financial system and credit information availability are poised for a transformation .
Drawing on the recommendations of the task force ( Chairman : Shri Yeshwant M. Deosthalee ) , the Reserve Bank has decided to set up a pubic credit registry ( PCR ) with an Implementation Task Force ( ITF ) assigned to design the logistics .
Third , the Reserve Bank has put in place a graded enforcement action framework for any lapses observed in conducting a bank ' s statutory audit to address large divergences in asset classification and provisioning in the credit portfolio of banks as well as rein in the rising incidence of frauds in the Indian banking system .
As pointed out in the Detailed Assessment Report of the Financial Sector Assessment Program ( FSAP ) of the IMF-World Bank , legal reforms facilitating ownership-neutral regulation and supervision of the banking system would empower the Reserve Bank further in supervisory enforcement .
The impact of international financial reporting standards on quantitative and qualitative reporting by banks would be reviewed , aligned and integrated with the supervisory framework , in view of its impending implementation .
An Audit Management Application portal to handle various supervisory functions of the cyber security and information technology examination cell in the Reserve Bank and to fully automate monitoring of returns has been envisaged in order to facilitate consistency and efficiency of the offsite monitoring mechanism .
Efficiency and security of the payment and settlement architecture is paramount for the Reserve Bank in the context of its mandate of oversight over the system .
These issues will engage policy attention in 2018-19 .
In the port sector , more than 576 projects with an estimated cost of ₹ 8,700 billion have been identified for implementation under the Sagarmala project .
Second , even as infrastructure development provides the thrust , sustaining the momentum of growth will hinge around its inclusiveness and , in particular , its employment intensity .
With regard to reforms in labour laws , codification is in progress and the Code on Wages Bill has been introduced in the Lok Sabha .
Over the medium-term , the pace and quality of growth will be anchored by progress on the unfinished agenda of structural reforms in , inter alia , resolution of banking and corporate financial stress ; taxation ; agriculture ; liberalisation of the economy ' s external interface , especially with FDI ; and galvanising the business environment .
The hard-earned gains of macroeconomic stability that have defined the recent period as its greatest achievement need to be preserved as an imperative within this endeavour .
The Indian economy exhibited resilience during 2017-18 , with upturns in investment and construction .
Inflation eased on a year-on-year basis in an environment characterised by high variability .
In an environment in which global growth gained traction and broadened across In an environment in ' which global geographies with international trade outpacing it , the Indian economy rounded a turning point during Q2 of 2017-18 as it emerged out of a five-quarter slowdown .
In the second half of the year , these impulses strengthened as manufacturing started In the second half of the year , these recovering from sluggishness , accompanied by strong corporate sales growth , an uptick in capacity utilisation and drawdown of inventories of finished goods , an incipient starting up of the capital expenditure ( capex ) cycle and slow return of pricing power .
These developments carry risks as well .
In this context , aggregate demand pressures emanating from a deviation from the budgeted fiscal deficit of the general government may spill over into higher external imbalances , contributing to a ' twin deficit ' challenge .
Equally worrisome is the emergence of hysteretic pressure patterns in recent inflation outcomes under the camouflage of a delayed winter season softening of vegetable prices that has started to reverse from May 2018 .
Third , financing conditions are tightening just as the nascent shoots of growth are taking root . Liquidity is gradually rebalancing while gilt and corporate bond yields are hardening and banks have begun raising their interest rates .
Fourth , global spillovers from markets repricing monetary policy normalisation by systemic central banks as well as geo-political and idiosyncratic risks remain contingent threats to macroeconomic and financial stability as well as to growth prospects .
Aggregate demand , which is featured in the immediately following sub-section , decelerated due to a slowdown in consumption , both private and government , and a decline in net export as the surge in imports outpaced exports .
Support came from growth in gross capital formation which pushed up the investment rate to 34.1 per cent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) in 2017-18 , up from 33.2 per cent in 2016-17 .
The sub-section on aggregate supply , which follows , profiles its slower pace and the underlying movements of its constituents - - robust performance of agriculture and allied activities on top of a high base , reinvigoration of industrial activity , and the resilience of services .
Decomposing the evolution of aggregate demand - measured by year-on-year ( y-o-y ) growth of GDP - reveals that its slide into a thirteen-quarter low of 5.6 per cent in Q1 : 2017- 18 was set off by a slowdown in fixed investment and decline in net exports .
Three- quarter moving averages of seasonally adjusted annualised growth rates attest to the interplay of momentum and base effects in aggregate demand conditions ( Chart II.1.1 ) .
For the year as a whole though , Central Statistics Office ' s ( CSO ) provisional estimates ( PE ) indicate that there is room for a sizeable catch-up in aggregate demand - GDP growth at 6.7 per cent trailed 0.4 percentage points below the preceding year ' s rate .
Private final consumption expenditure ( PFCE ) , which accounted for close to 57 per cent of real GDP growth in 2016-17 , ceded share and its weighted contribution fell to around 55 per cent in 2017-18 ( Chart Il.1.2 ) .
While support from government final consumption was maintained at the preceding year ' s level , net exports depleted domestic demand after remaining in broad balance a year ago .
This firming up of GFCF during 2017- 18 acquires significance in the context of the recent experience which saw the rate of fixed investment , measured by the GFCF / GDP ratio , worsening steadily from 34.3 per cent in 2011- 12 to 30.3 per cent in 2015-16 .
The coincident turnaround in the growth of GDP and GFCF bears out the empirically validated switching role of the latter in turning points in the path of the Indian economy ( Box II.1.1 ) .
In terms of its determinants as employed by CSO , movements in GFCF appear to have been underpinned by the behaviour of domestic production of capital goods during the phase of a slowdown as well as the recent upturn from Q2 : 2017-18 .
As regards other drivers , viz . , value added in construction turned up in the preceding quarter , but imports of capital goods lost strength from Q3 after a surge that started a year ago ( Chart II.1.3 ) .
The revival in gross fixed capital formation ( GFCF ) in the second half of 2017-18 , has aroused considerable interest , with questions around its turning points and durability given that several lead / coincident indicators - sales growth , capacity utilisation , inventory drawdown , pricing power are also pointing to a much awaited upturn in the investment cycle .
Since Q2 : 2017-18 , however , the growth of GFCF has picked up and sustained in Q3 and Q4 averaging 11.7 per cent .
Consequently , the business regulatory environment , taxation laws , and governance / institutional capacity often influence the ease and cost of starting a business as well as normal day-to-day operations .
Quantitative and qualitative determinants of the investment climate have been captured in the form of a single index that helps identify the relative rank of a country , such as the ease of doing business index of the World Bank , competitiveness index ( WEF , 2017 ) , policy uncertainty index ( Baker , et a / . , 2016 ) , corruption index ( Transparency International , 2018 ) and the like .
For the empirical assessment , year-on-year ( y-o-y ) growth in real GFCF and the GFCF to GDP ratio were taken as dependent variables representing the realised investment climate , while y-o-y changes in the economic policy uncertainty index , the business expectations index in the RBI ' s Industrial Outlook Survey and quarterly changes in the number of stalled projects are used as the measurable high frequency indicators of the investment climate .
Construction activity remained subdued in 2016-17 with Q4 : 2016-17 recording a contraction .
Recent structural reforms in the sector such as Real Estate ( Regulation and Development ) Act , 2016 , might have produced some _ initial retardation before beneficial effects set in .
As current profits are expected to alter the earnings outlook or the expected return on new investment , higher profitability resulting from lower input costs , higher output prices or improved productivity could brighten the investment climate .
Headwinds from factors like slow growth in demand represented by non-agricultural income , subdued business confidence , and higher real interest rates ( j.e. , the policy rate as well as the real weighted average lending rate ) are seen to retard investment .
An appreciation of the real exchange rate , which is an indicator of possible loss of external competitiveness , unless offset by higher productivity is found to adversely impact future investment demand ( Table 1 ) .
This was also mirrored in proximate coincident indicators - steel consumption and cement production .
The share of fixed investment in dwellings , buildings and other structures dropped from 16.3 per cent of GDP in 2015-16 to 15.7 per cent in 2016-17 , primarily in the household sector , followed by public non-financial corporations ( Chart II.1.4 ) .
This was , however , compensated by fixed investment in machinery and equipment whose share rose from 10.6 per cent of GDP in 2015-16 to 11.9 per cent in 2016-17 .
Constrained by the rigidities confronting the domestic supply of capital goods cited above , domestic demand has increasingly spilled over into imports , resulting in the phenomenon of reverse substitution of domestic production by imports .
The Reserve Bank ' s Order Books , Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey ( OBICUS ) points to a pick-up in capacity utilisation in manufacturing alongside a drawdown in finished goods inventories from Q2 : 2017-18 .
There has also been a gradual return of pricing power of manufacturing enterprises since Q3 : 2017-18 .
Stalled projects , both in numbers and value , declined in Q1 : 2018- 19 ; however , new _ investments remained lukewarm uniformly across the government and the private sectors ( Chart II.1.5 ) .
The infrastructure sector , which is a key barometer of the investment climate , reflects the green shoots of strengthening capital formation in the economy after a hiatus .
First , the length of highway projects constructed during 2017-18 maintained its growth momentum by increasing to 9,829 km from 8,232 km in the previous year .
The length of highway projects awarded during 2017-18 increased to 17,055 km from 15,949 km in the preceding year .
A key development was the laying down of the foundation for the Mumbai- Ahmedabad bullet train project .
As in the past , consumption remained the dominant component of aggregate demand in 2017-18 , accounting for 66.6 per cent of GDP .
Consumption expenditure has provided valuable support to aggregate demand through the recent slowdown , including by cushioning the shocks imparted by demonetisation and the implementation of GST .
In fact , the period 2013- 17 is characterised as one of consumption- led growth ( RBI Annual Report , 2016-17 ) as it contributed 64.4 per cent of the change in GDP during these years .
In particular , GFCE , buoyed by enhanced salaries , pensions and allowances under the 7 central pay commission ' s award for central government employees and the one rank one pension award for defence personnel , has operated like a fiscal stimulus in a period of sluggish demand in the economy .
If GFCE is excluded , the average growth of GDP of 6.9 per cent during 2016-18 would slump to 6.4 per cent .
The evolution of GFCE is sketched out within a fuller analysis of public finances in section II.5.
PFCE , the mainstay of aggregate demand in India , slowed down in 2017-18 , with the deceleration more pronounced in the first half of the year .
The loss of speed in PFCE reflected a combination of factors - the overhang of demonetisation , especially in respect of the unorganised sector ; the initial disruptions associated with the implementation of GST ; and some deceleration in rural wage growth .
Domestic saving declined to 29.6 per cent of gross national disposable income ( GNDI ) in 2016-17 from 30.7 per cent in 2015- 16 ( Appendix Table 3 ) .
Household financial saving - the most important source of funds for investment in the economy declined to 6.7 per cent of GNDI in 2016-17 , down from 8.1 per cent in 2015-16 ( Table II.1.1 ) .
As per the Bank ' s preliminary estimates , net financial assets of the household sector increased to 7.1 per cent of GNDI in 2017-18 on account of an increase in households ' assets in the form of currency , despite an increase in households ' liabilities .
Aggregate supply , measured by gross value added ( GVA ) at basic prices expanded at a slower y-o-y pace in 2017-18 , 0.6 percentage points down from 7.1 per cent in the preceding year and 0.9 percentage points below the decennial trend rate of 7.4 per cent ( Appendix Table 2 ) .
Disentangling momentum from base effects , it is interesting to observe that while momentum registered an uptick in Q2 , providing a much needed thrust to growth , base effects also came into play in H2 .
For the year 2017- 18 though , annual growth rates obscure an important turning point that is picked up in quarterly changes .
Services , which comprise over three-fifths of GVA rebounded in 2017-18 with a broad-based growth across sub-sectors ( Table 11.1.2 ) .
The disconnect between annual and quarterly growth rates in capturing the shifts in GVA in 2017-18 is evident in each constituent .
In respect of agriculture and allied activities , GVA grew by 3.4 per cent in 2017-18 on top of record levels of foodgrains and horticulture output that fuelled a growth of 6.3 per cent a year ago .
Nonetheless , the contribution of agriculture and allied activities to real GVA growth declined to 7.9 per cent from 13.6 per cent in 2016-17 .
To situate this assessment in some perspective , the southwest monsoon arrived two days ahead of schedule in 2017 and ten days earlier than last year , but it lost momentum during mid-July and August and this took a toll on sowing acreage in the season as a whole .
Eventually , precipitation for the season as a whole was only 5 per cent below the long period average ( LPA ) , but knock-on effects of the mid- season dry spell led to merely 0.3 per cent growth over the last year in kharif foodgrain production .
Yet , it is important to note that the output level achieved in 2016-17 was an all-time record .
If the 2017-18 kharif performance is evaluated against that backdrop , all crops grew by more than 10 percentage points over the average of the last 10 year production .
Among cash crops , sugarcane and cotton production exceeded the preceding year ' s level but jute and mesta output dropped marginally .
Turning to the rabi season , the delayed retreat of the southwest monsoon led to late sowing .
Moreover , the progress of rabi sowing was hindered by the uncertainty surrounding stubble burning and the sudden onset of cold conditions during January 2018 .
The deep deflation in the prices of pulses , oilseeds and several perishables also dis-incentivised acreage expansion in these crops .
Ultimately , the northeast monsoon season ended with a rainfall deficiency of 11 per cent below the LPA , but supported by comfortable levels of water in major reservoirs , sowing managed to survive the vicissitudes of weather and was just 0.8 percentage points lower than last year ' s level .
Overall , India is set for a record foodgrain output in the crop year ending June 2018 increasing by 1.6 per cent y-o-y to a level of 279.5 million tonnes ( Table II.1.3 ) .
The output of rice , wheat , pulses and coarse cereals is expected to have achieved record levels in 2017-18 , while oilseeds production declined on account of lower production of soyabean .
As a result , water level in 91 major reservoirs in the country replenished and turned out higher than the previous year ' s level .
However , the kharif sowing so far is lower by 1.5 per cent compared to the last year ' s acreage .
Accounting for 34 per cent of the value of output from crops ( average over 2011-16 ) , horticulture has imparted stability to agricultural output .
In 2017- 18 , horticulture production touched a record level of 307.2 million tonnes , up by 2.2 per cent over the level in 2016-17 .
The production of fruits and vegetables increased y-o-y by 1.6 per cent and 2.2 per cent , respectively .
The rise in horticulture productivity was not sustained in 2017-18 , with the per acre production decreasing marginally by 0.06 per cent .
Allied activities , which include forestry , fishing and livestock contribute around 39 per cent of the gross output in agriculture and allied activities .
In order to promote allied activities , the government has set up an Animal Husbandry and Infrastructure Development Fund ( AHIDF ) for financing infrastructure requirements of the animal husbandry sector .
The facility of Kisan Credit Card has been extended to the fisheries and livestock farmers .
A National Mission on Bovine Productivity helps to reach the benefits of animal husbandry to farmers directly .
The five year average growth ( 2012-13 till 2016-17 ) of allied activities has stepped up to 5.6 per cent , well above the quinquennial average growth of 2.7 per cent for the sector of agriculture and allied activities as a whole .
In order to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities , e-NAM , the e-trading platform for the National Agriculture Market was launched in April 2016 and its reach has been expanded considerably over the last two years .
The scheme has immense potential to transform the agricultural marketing structure through smoother inter-state movements , more efficient price discovery and removal of intermediaries .
Recent initiatives to boost e-NAM include : ( a ) simplifying registration of farmers on the portal , ( b ) expanding payment options ( addition of Unified Payment Interface ) and ( c ) extending e-NAM trading in six languages .
Measures such as third-party assaying , quality certification mechanisms , dispute settlement mechanisms and digital infrastructure will improve the adoption of e-NAM considerably .
Procurement at MSP is , however , largely restricted to rice ( kharif season ) and wheat ( rabi season ) .
As a result , the weighted average mandi prices trade below the MSP for many of the crops , e.g. , urad , tur , chana , lentil , maize , groundnut , soyabean , bajra , rapeseed and mustard , causing loss to farmers .
In line with the announcement in the Union Budget , the Government has recently fixed MSP for several kharif crops for the sowing season of 2018-19 which ensures a return of at least 50 per cent over the cost of production ( as measured by A2 plus FL ) .
A few state governments have also launched their own price support schemes / financial assistance for farmers .
In order to address growing farmers ' distress , several state governments , viz . , Uttar Pradesh , Punjab , Maharashtra , Rajasthan and Karnataka have announced farm loan waivers .
While waivers may cleanse banks ' balance sheets in the short-term , they may dis-incentivise banks from lending to agriculture in the long-term ( EPW Research Foundation 2008 ; Rath 2008 ) .
GVA growth in industry decelerated on a y-o-y basis to 5.5 per cent in 2017-18 in a sequence that commenced a year ago when it came off a recent peak of 12.1 per cent in 2015-16 .
Consequently , the weighted contribution of industry to overall GVA growth declined from 33.5 per cent in 2015-16 to 20.0 per cent in 2017-18 .
Also , the cyclical component of growth ( estimated through a univariate approach using the Hodrick-Prescott filter ) turned negative in 2017-18 and capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sub-sector remained below the 10-year average ( Chart Il.1.7 a and b ) .
On a seasonally adjusted three-quarter moving average annualised basis , industrial GVA growth recovered sharply in Q2 and maintained an upward trajectory thereafter .
As stated earlier , annual changes mask the inflexion points in the evolution of industrial output during the course of the year .
Quarterly growth rates reflected a protracted slowdown that started during Q2 : 2016-17 and slid into a contraction in Q1 : 2017-18 .
In Q2 , however , there was a rebound driven by manufacturing and electricity generation , which helped the overall value added to shrug off the drag from mining .
Over H2 : 2017-18 , the tempo of expansion in industrial GVA was sustained on the shoulders of an acceleration in manufacturing , despite the support from the electricity sub-sector moderating and a slump in mining output .
The deceleration in the growth of GVA in industry in 2017-18 in relation to the preceding year is also reflected in the index of industrial production ( IIP ) , although intra-year movements in industrial output reflected an underlying improvement gathering ( Table Il.1.4 ) .
At a sectoral level , the recovery was witnessed in the manufacturing sector , while mining and electricity sectors decelerated .
In terms of use based activity , primary goods , capital goods , consumer durables and infrastructure / construction goods contributed to the acceleration in the IIP growth .
While mining and quarrying output has been considerably volatile in recent years on account of commodity-specific constraints , favourable base effects enabled a pick-up in Q2 from a flatter outcome in the preceding quarter .
The upturn was short-lived , however , as coal and natural gas production fell off and crude oil output declined .
Coal output decelerated for three successive years ( 2015-16 to 2017-18 ) .
Consequently , the reliance on imported coal for thermal power plants has reduced only marginally .
Recent initiatives to allocate additional coal mines and easing regulations for coal-bed methane extraction could boost CIL ' s output .
The output of fossil fuels , viz . , crude oil and natural gas , has been constrained by the natural decline in extraction from ageing oil fields and factors like uncertain price policy , power shut downs , water cuts , and labour related frictions .
Iron ore has been the clear bright spot in mining commodities in recent years , and its output growth in 2017-18 remained strong despite disruptions in the major mining states of Odisha and Goa .
The growth in iron ore mining was helped by the underlying growth of steel demand , both domestic and global ; favourable commodity prices and trade policy interventions .
The recovery in manufacturing was broad- based with production in 15 industry groups out of the total of 23 industry groups expanding during H2 : 2017-18 vis-a-vis only 10 industries during H1 .
By Q3 , the combined contribution of items that registered expansion had decisively reversed the five preceding quarters of decline .
Among the major industry groups , coke and refined petroleum , chemical and chemical products , food products , machinery and equipment and other non-metallic mineral products together accounted for 33.8 per cent of the IIP , which witnessed a turnaround in performance .
Pharmaceuticals registered the highest growth rates driven by digestive enzymes and antacids ( DEAs ) .
Moreover , a slow return of pricing power is also taking root amidst rising input cost pressures ; consequently , profit margins are improving ( Chart Il.1.8a ) .
Indicators of operational performance from the RBI ' s OBICUS survey point to a reduction in inventory levels for manufacturing firms in Q4 : 2017-18 .
Also , the capacity utilisation level improved in Q2-Q4 : 2017-18 after deteriorating marginally in Q1 : 2017-18 ( Chart II.1.8b ) .
As regards expectations , manufacturing firms polled in the RBI Industrial Outlook Survey turned optimistic in Q3-Q4 : 2017-18 , though the expectations for Q1-Q2 : 2018-19 dipped due to weaker prospects for production , order books , profit margins and overall financial situation .
Electricity generation began on a strong note with sequential acceleration in H1 of 2017-18 on the back of a revival in demand from Distribution Companies ( DISCOMs ) .
In Q4 though , supply accelerated , reducing the power deficit ( Chart Il.1.9 ) .
Demand-supply dynamics were reflected in spot prices peaking in Q3 : 2017-18 on the Indian Energy Exchange , when the power deficit was the highest .
In terms of sources , thermal power , which has the highest share , was beset with challenges impacting both demand and supply .
On the demand side , financial vulnerability of DISCOMs has constrained offtake and led to aversion to enter into new long-term power purchase agreements ( PPAs ) .
Some DISCOMs have defaulted on such existing agreements , substituting them with lower cost spot-market purchases .
Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana ( UDAY ) has yielded some results in bridging the gap between aggregate cost of supply and aggregate revenue realised through interventions in lowering finance costs , reducing aggregate technical and commercial losses , and increasing prices for the domestic segment .
However , the progress has been uneven across states with spillover effects for power generation companies - particularly for thermal power plants with high-cost PPAs .
Excess capacity continues to persist in the thermal power sector ( especially in the private sector ) with plants operating at sub-optimal plant load factor ( PLF ) that in turn could undermine their financial viability going forward .
Renewable energy has seen _ higher consistent growth during the year .
Over the last 10 years , installed capacity increased almost 6 times - from 11.1 GW in 2007-08 to 65.5 GW in 2017-18 - and its share in power generation increased from 3.0 per cent in 2007-08 to 7.1 per cent in 2017-18 .
The composition of renewable energy itself is undergoing structural change , with the share of solar rising sharply to around 24 per cent in 2017-18 from a negligible level in 2007-08 .
The higher growth in renewables is in part driven by emissions targets committed under the Paris Climate Accord .
Photo-Voltaic ( PV ) cell costs have declined sharply with increasing technology maturity and scale of production .
The renewable energy target set by the government ( 175 GW installed capacity by 2022 ) gives the highest priority to solar energy ( 100 GW installed capacity ) .
India has taken the lead in international co-operation for solar energy development , by taking a leadership role in establishing the International Solar Alliance ( ISA ) , a platform for sharing affordable technology and mobilising low-cost finance among member nations .
The ISA has set a target of 1 Terawatt ( TW ) of solar energy by 2030 .
By contrast , the acceleration in H2 was driven by capital goods , infrastructure / construction goods and intermediate goods .
Capital goods output - considered an indicator of capital formation / investment - recovered from contraction mode _ since September 2016 ( barring expansion _ in November 2016 and March 2017 ) and expanded for seven successive months since August 2017 .
Transportation and manufacturing sector related investment goods like commercial vehicles and vehicle parts , tyres , ship building , separators and sugar machinery were the drivers .
Infrastructure / construction goods expanded in H1 , with strong growth in iron and steel related products outweighing the contraction in cement production .
The segment regained strength and posted acceleration in H2 due to a sharp pick-up in cement production and continued strong growth in iron and steel on progress in government driven infrastructure projects , including affordable housing .
Consumer non-durables , the strongest driver from the use-based side was _ heavily influenced by pharmaceuticals , in particular , DEAs .
Excluding DEAs , this category would have contracted in H1 , although components within the food and beverages industry group like sugar , milk , poultry meat and shrimps revived activity in the category in H2 .
Consumer durables output resumed growth from November 2017 onwards after contraction in 9 out of previous 11 months .
In the case of intermediate goods , output growth closely followed that of manufacturing .
In contrast to the industrial sector , the services sector growth accelerated on a y-o-y basis to 7.6 per cent in 2017-18 breaking the sequence of two years of deceleration .
Also , excluding the government driven PADO component , service sector growth rate accelerated from 5.7 per cent in 2016-17 to 7.0 per cent in 2017-18 .
Nevertheless these growth rates remain significantly lower than the recent high of 9.3 per cent ( 2014-16 ) .
On a seasonally adjusted three-quarter moving average annualised basis , services GVA growth ( excluding PADO ) recovered sharply in Q1 , influenced by the acceleration in trade and real estate segments due to the push to clear inventories before the GST launch .
Seasonally adjusted and decomposed into momentum ( q-o-q changes ) and base effects , the momentum achieved in Q1 weakened in the subsequent quarters .
The recovery in services GVA was fairly broad-based across constituent sub-sectors ( Chart II.1.10a ) .
In terms of weighted contribution to growth , that of PADO declined marginally in 2017-18 , while all other sub-sectors witnessed improvement ( Chart II.1.10b ) .
The CSO ' s initial GVA estimates of the services sector are based on the benchmark- indicator method .
Construction GVA accelerated in 2017-18 with steel consumption growing at a sustained pace throughout and cement production accelerating in Q3-Q4 .
The key drivers were government infrastructure projects .
Trade , hotels , transport , communication and services related to broadcasting posted robust growth which was sustained through the year , visible also in the performance of coincident indicators .
Trade and transport are the biggest components , accounting for 59 per cent and 26 per cent , respectively , of this sub-sector .
In the transport segment , railways , road and services incidental to transport are the biggest sub-components with shares of 15 per cent , 66 per cent and 16 per cent , respectively .
Under rail transport , net tonne kilometres ( 70 per cent weight ) registered significant acceleration in H2 while passenger traffic ( 80 per cent weight ) growth remained subdued throughout the year .
In the road transport segment , the stock of commercial vehicles on road accelerated from Q2 : 2017-18 onwards , with sales of new commercial vehicles showing robust growth .
The acceleration observed in transport sector indicators during 2017-18 continued in Q1 : 2018-19 , reflected in both rail freight traffic and commercial vehicle sales .
The major components of financial , real estate and professional services sub-sector are ownership of dwellings ( 29 per cent ) , financial services ( 28 per cent share ) and IT services ( 21 per cent ) .
Under financial services , bank credit accelerated significantly in H2 after a subdued performance in the preceding half .
Aggregate deposits , in contrast , decelerated sharply in H2 after registering strong growth in H1 : 2017-18 .
In the case of IT services , the resilient EBITDA posted a growth of 5.7 per cent while the growth in staff costs was broadly positive in 2017-18 .
Exports of software services showed improvement though they faced uncertainties from visa policies in the United States and Australia .
PADO continued to provide an upward thrust to the sector .
The Reserve Bank ' s ' service sector composite index ( SSCI ) , which extracts and combines information collated from high frequency indicators and _ statistically leads GVA growth in the services sector turned up in Q3 : 2017-18 ( Chart II.1.11 ) .
A downward tendency in SSCI for Q1 : 2018-19 , may be indicative of subdued services sector activity .
Formal sector employment , compiled from payroll data ( Employees ' Provident Fund points towards an improvement in jobs created in 2017-18 vis-a-vis 2016-17 .
Further , the Labour Bureau Quarterly Employment Survey , which measures addition to employment in the organised sector across eight sectors , indicates an _ incremental employment of 0.2 million in 2017-18 ( up to September ) which was higher than Q1-Q2 : 2016- 17 by 0.9 lakhs .
The Union Budget 2017-18 had emphasised on energising of the youth through education , skills and jobs .
The Skill India Mission launched in July 2015 to maximise the benefits of a huge demographic advantage was intensified by the Skill Acquisition and Knowledge Awareness for Livelihood Promotion Programme ( SANKALP ) launched at a cost of ₹ 40 billion in 2017-18 .
It is expected to provide market relevant trainings to around 35 million youth .
Further , the next phase of Skill Strengthening for Industrial Value Enhancement ( STRIVE ) , launched at a cost of ₹ 22 billion in 2017-18 with a focus on improving the quality and market relevance of vocational trainings provided in it , would strengthen the apprenticeship programmes through an industry cluster approach .
A special scheme for creating employment in the textile sector has already been launched , and a similar scheme was to be implemented for leather and footwear industries in 2017-18 .
Going forward , the focus of Union Budget 2018-19 on certain sectors such as agriculture , infrastructure , small and medium enterprises ( SMEs ) and also rural areas in general may provide a further fillip to consumption demand .
The expected normal southwest monsoon in 2018 may also facilitate in Keeping rural demand at an elevated level .
To sum up , economic activity in the Indian economy exhibited resilience in the face of several shocks during the year - demonetisation ' s after effects ; GST implementation ; spillovers from global sell-offs in bonds and equities ; bouts of capital outflows ; frauds in domestic banking system amidst mounting loan delinquencies and capital constraints ; and the ongoing terms of trade erosion .
In this setting , loss of speed in GDP growth of 0.4 percentage points in relation to the preceding year notwithstanding , India ' s real GDP growth at 6.7 per cent was still among the highest for major continental-sized economies in the world .
In the second half of the year , the impact of these drag factors started gradually accelerated to 7.4 per cent , exceeding the annual pace of growth in 2016-17 .
Importantly from a forward looking perspective , several turning points were passed in various quarters during the year - notably , gross fixed investment on the demand side , and on the supply side , manufacturing in industrial activity and construction in services .
If these inflexions take firmer hold , they should support an enduring acceleration of momentum in the economy and spur an expansion into employment and incomes all around .
Agriculture and allied activities have provided a solid foundation to the Indian several shocks ( as alluded to earlier ) .
A second successive year of bumper production of foodgrains and horticulture on the back of reasonably good monsoons has not , however , translated adequately into a boost to farm and rural incomes .
Adverse and worsening terms of trade and high variability in the access to international markets has sapped away the large gains in production .
A distinctive feature of the evolution of headline inflation during 2017-18 has been its high variability , notwithstanding lower average inflation relative to its history through the new series ( Table II.2.1 ) .
Against this backdrop , sub- section 1 discusses the movements in headline inflation through three phases during the year , with food inflation playing an important role in both disinflationary and reflationary periods .
Sub- section 2 assesses global inflation developments , which is followed by a detailed analysis of the major constituents of inflation in sub-section 3 , with an emphasis on the drivers of food , fuel , and excluding food and fuel inflation .
Sub-section 4 discusses other indicators of inflation such as sectoral consumer price index ( CPI ) , wholesale price index ( WPI ) , and GDP deflators as well as movements in wages - both rural wages and corporate staff costs .
Sub-section 5 provides some concluding observations .
In a surprise relative to expectations and consensus forecasts , inflation fell off the precipice in Q1 under the weight of overhang of the supply glut in inflation-sensitive food items , notably pulses and oilseeds , as well as higher mandi arrivals of some vegetables such as potatoes and onions .
In the event , instead of the usual pre-monsoon upturn , food prices sank into deflation , taking headline inflation down into a temporary breach of the tolerance floor of the inflation target band .
At 1.5 per cent in June 2017 , it was the lowest reading in the new CPI series .
Moreover , continuing deflation in the prices of pulses and spices ( during June-March , 2017-18 ) , along with moderation in prices of overall food and miscellaneous components imparted a negative skew to headline inflation , as against a positive skew during 2016-17 .
From July , a confluence of domestic and global developments propelled headline inflation up by 375 basis points ( bps ) to 5.2 per cent in December 2017 , a 17-month high ( Chart II.2.1 ) .
Just as in the disinflation phase , the reflation was led by prices of vegetables , particularly of tomatoes and onions .
The disbursement of house rent allowance ( HRA ) for central government employees under the 7 Central Pay Commission ' s award added momentum .
In particular , the prices of vegetables surged in an unseasonal spike during October-November due to the late withdrawal of southwest monsoon leading to the damage of some crops .
The usual seasonal softening in food prices with the arrival of the winter harvest finally occurred with a delay in December which , together with pro-active supply management measures adopted by the government - import of onions and imposition of a minimum export price ( MEP ) - helped contain price pressures and headline inflation ebbed to 4.3 per cent in March 2018 .
Excluding the effect of the HRA , it was even lower at 3.9 per cent .
Strikingly , the weighted contribution of inflation excluding food and fuel to headline inflation jumped up in Q3 : 2017-18 and persisted at elevated levels through March 2018 with signs of a closing output gap and rising capacity utilisation .
For the year as a whole , inflation came down on an annual average basis to 3.6 per cent in 2017-18 , around 90 bps lower than a year ago .
Excluding the impact of HRA , annual average inflation during 2017-18 stood at 3.4 per cent ( Table II.2.1 ) .
The decline was not broad- based though , with housing and fuel inflation increasing in 2017-18 ( Appendix Table 4 ) .
According to the March 2018 round expectations remained elevated for both three months ahead and a year ahead horizons .
This is also corroborated by more forward-looking professional forecasters in the Reserve Bank ' s March 2018 round of the survey of professional forecasters .
Beginning 2018-19 , headline inflation picked up during Q1 : 2018-19 largely led by increase in prices within food , fuel and miscellaneous sub-groups .
While price pressures were broad-based in case of miscellaneous component , within food group upside pressures primarily emanated from vegetables and select protein-rich items like meat and fish .
Domestic inflation developments acquire contextual relevance when they are situated in a global perspective .
Globally , prices of agricultural commodities , especially of food items such as cereals , sugar and edible oils like soyabean remained broadly soft during the year , reflecting abundant supply .
In the non-food category , metal prices hardened due to strong demand from China , which accounts for more than half of global consumption .
The price of the Indian basket of crude oil moved in tandem and rose to US $ 64 per barrel in March 2018 from US $ 51 per barrel in March 2017 .
Against this backdrop , an interesting development has been that even as inflation has picked up with economic recovery in advanced economies during 2017 , it has eased in emerging and developing Asia despite stable economic growth and rising global commodity prices , suggesting an important role for inflation targeting ( IT ) as a monetary policy framework and its gradual refinements over the years in a number of Asian economies ( Box II.2.1 ) .
Circling back to the domestic price front , intra-year movements in headline inflation were underpinned by significant shifts at the sub- group level ( Chart II.2.2 ) .
Inflation in Asia after the Global Financial Crisis - How is it Different from the Rest of the World ?
While the advanced economies have witnessed a pick-up in inflation along with economic recovery , after a prolonged period of deflationary risks , emerging market and developing economies ( EMDEs ) as a group , and emerging and developing Asia ' in particular , have continued to record moderation in inflation ( Charts 1.a & 1.6 ) .
A cross- country comparison of weights of fuel and food in the CPI shows that the weights are generally higher in select Asian economies than in advanced economies ( Chart 2 ) .
When independent variables are not strictly exogenous and are correlated with their past , a dynamic panel model is considered to be appropriate .
An Arellano-Bond dynamic panel using GMM in first difference of the regressors corrects for endogeneity , autocorrelation and deficiencies of the fixed effect panel regression .
Arellano-Bover / Blundell-Bond , which is an augmented version of Arellano-Bond , allows for more instrumental variables , generally leading to an improved efficiency of the model .
Data are sourced from IMF ' s World Economic Outlook ( WEO ) and International Financial Statistics ( IFS ) , World Bank , CEIC and Bloomberg .
The output gap for Asian economies is calculated using Hodrick-Prescott ( HP ) filter , while for advanced economies they are taken from WEO .
It seems that while inflation targeting has acquired some success , factors like supply shocks ( such as global oil price shock ) and inflation inertia or history ( which can adaptively drive inflation expectations ) still continue to play a role in shaping inflation dynamics .
The base model was run with a truncated set of countries and time period ( 11 Asian economies and for 2001-2017 ) .
This time the IT dummy variable was set up to take the value 1 in case of inflation targeters and 0 otherwise .
Also , the starting year of the truncated sample period was considered from 2001 , taking into account China ' s entry into the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) and its potential role in influencing regional and global inflation dynamics .
While the coefficient associated with the IT dummy turned out to be statistically significant with a larger negative value , the results also suggested an increasing role of inflation persistence ( lagged inflation ) along with factors like supply shocks in terms of global energy price inflation , exchange rate depreciation and import share in GDP in determining inflation dynamics .
Also , interestingly , the lagged output gap coefficient turned out to be statistically significant with a positive sign , which was not the case in the full sample model .
This suggests that while inflation targeting has been and is an important factor in the moderation of inflation in Asian countries , other factors like exchange rate , energy prices as well as domestic demand conditions also play with the exogenous shock of global a role .
In this context , it may be noted that the IT framework in some countries has undergone changes over the years ( Table 2 ) .
In addition , the Bank of Thailand also shifted to a point target with a tolerance band from its earlier range target in order to give a clearer signal to the public regarding the commitment of monetary policy in maintaining price stability .
Subsequent paragraphs will profile the key drivers of the collapse of food inflation in the first half of the year and its surge in the second half , the sustained increase in fuel inflation from Q2 albeit with some moderation in Q4 , and the upturn in inflation in ' excluding food and fuel category ' during the second half of the year causing it to exceed 5 per cent from December 2017 and to rule above headline all through March 2018 .
For 2017-18 as a whole , food and beverages ( weight : 45.9 per cent in CPI ) inflation overall inflation dropping to 29 per cent from moderated _ sharply , its contribution to 46 per cent a year ago amidst significant intra- year variability .
The softening in food prices , which began as early as in the second half of 2016-17 under the weight of a bumper crop and distress sales post-demonetisation , spilled into the first quarter of 2017-18 , diving into deflation during May-June 2017 ( Chart II.2.3 ) .
Despite a delayed build-up of upside pressures in prices of vegetables , overall food inflation remained quiescent through Q2 , aided by the timely and well-spread onset of the southwest monsoon during June-July 2017 and adequate food stocks .
In August , however , the monsoon lost momentum , producing high temporal and spatial variability and a delayed withdrawal in October .
The seasonal downturn finally arrived in December 2017 , easing average food inflation to 3.7 per cent in Q4 : 2017-18 .
During January 2011 to March 2018 , both CPl-cereals inflation and CPl-pulses inflation witnessed two structural breaks , with the onset and spread of monsoon a major factor behind the breaks .
Further , the easing phase in recent years in prices of both cereals and pulses is largely driven by cyclical components , indicative of good monsoon , bountiful supply and soothing global food prices .
Prices of perishable items - primarily vegetables - that account for 13 per cent of the food group and 6 per cent of the CPI , were the principal drivers of the rise and fall of food inflation during the year .
During 2016-17 and 2017-18 , fluctuations in vegetables prices have proved pivotal in determining turning points and amplitude of food price waves , notwithstanding their low weight in the CPI relative to cereals and products .
Notably , the trend and cyclical components of CPl-vegetables prices have reversed after the post demonetisation plunge .
Active supply management strategies since November 2017 appear to have played an important role in containing price pressures in vegetables and consequently , in food prices too .
In terms of availability of inflation-sensitive vegetables such as tomatoes , onions and potatoes , intra-year movements in prices were influenced by the variability in mandi arrivals .
In the case of prices of tomatoes , inflation went up from ( - ) 41 per cent in June 2017 to 119 per cent in November 2017 due to supply disruptions on account of adverse weather conditions and farmers ' agitations in parts of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh .
The decline in prices of tomatoes during August-October provided some relief , before the delayed retreat of the monsoon rainfall during October led to crop losses in important tomato producing states like Karnataka , Andhra Pradesh , Telangana , Madhya Pradesh and Odisha .
With fresh winter arrivals from December , prices began softening following which tomato inflation dropped to ( - ) 6.6 per cent in March 2018 .
Inflation in prices of onions was another shock to food prices during 2017-18 .
From ( - ) 14 per cent in April 2017 , onion price inflation rose to 159 per cent in December .
Again , while unfavourable weather was a factor , large procurement of onions by a few state governments was the other principal driver .
Post December 2017 , onion prices plunged with the arrival of fresh winter crops , supported by supply management measures by the government .
The minimum export price ( MEP ) , which is the key supply management measure used by the government to contain upsurges in onion prices , was re-implemented and fine-tuned during the year .
This helped bring down onion price inflation to 66.8 per cent in March 2018 .
In the case of potatoes , delayed sowing in West Bengal - the key growing state in the country - due to extended monsoon showers in October induced price pressures , although carry-over stocks from the previous crop helped to rein them in .
Excluding vegetables , food _ _ inflation would have averaged 1.5 per cent during July 2017-March 2018 ( as against the actual food inflation of 3.0 per cent ) as compared to 5.3 per cent during the same period of 2016-17 .
Pulses , with a weight of around 5 per cent in the food group , imposed persistent downward pressures on food inflation throughout the year .
This is illustrated by the significant shift in the contribution of prices of pulses to overall inflation from ( + ) 6.0 per cent in 2016-17 to ( - ) 17.9 per cent in 2017-18 . With the production of pulses during 2017-18 higher at 24.51 million tonnes ( 23.13 million tonnes in 2016-17 ) , double-digit deflation in pulses became more pronounced relative to the previous year .
Mandi level arhar and urad prices in the major producing states of Maharashtra , Madhya Pradesh , Gujarat , Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka trailed well below their minimum support prices ( MSPs ) , reflecting lower procurement relative to supply .
Market prices remain above A2 costs ( i.e. , production costs excluding imputed labour costs ) , however , and as a result , adverse supply responses are not yet evident but may be inevitable , going forward .
Some mitigating measures have been adopted by the government during the course of the year - removal of the export ban on all pulses , imposition of 60 per cent import duty on gram and 30 per cent import duty on masoor .
Prices of oilseeds , in particular of soyabean , mustard and groundnut , also fell below their MSPs on the back of healthy domestic production during 2017-18 ( 30.64 million tonnes ) on top of a bumper crop in 2016-17 ( 81.28 million tonnes ) , after two consecutive years of drought .
As a result , the prices of edible oils ( mustard and groundnut ) also fell and inflation treaded in negative territory for the major part of 2017-18 .
International prices of edible oils also eased on the back of strong global production , passing through into domestic prices through imports .
The government raised the basic customs duties on different edible oils in August 2017 , November 2017 and March 2018 to support domestic prices by curbing cheaper imports .
Sugar and spices also contributed to the overall moderation in food inflation with imports improving supply alongside higher domestic production ( Sugarcane production increased to 35.51 million tonnes in 2017-18 from 30.61 million tonnes in 2016-17 ) .
Fuel inflation picked up from July 2017 and reached a high of 8.2 per cent in November 2017 from an intra-year low of 4.5 per cent in June 2017 , before easing to 5.7 per cent in March 2018 .
The rapid rise was led by prices of LPG and kerosene , reflecting the calibrated increase in their administered prices by the government since July 2016 with the aim of reducing the subsidy and progressively aligning domestic prices with international prices .
On the other hand , domestic non-subsidised LPG prices largely tracked international LPG price movements ( Chart II.2.5 ) .
The average price of non-subsidised LPG cylinders available for four metro cities fell by around % 57 in March 2018 over December 2017 , which was reflected in the moderation in fuel and light inflation during Q4 : 2017-18 .
Following the decision of the government to raise kerosene prices by 25 paise per litre every fortnight until the subsidy is eliminated , the gap between international and domestic kerosene prices has narrowed .
Firewood and chips was another major contributor to the rise in fuel and light inflation during the year .
After remaining sticky through 2016-17 , CPI inflation excluding food and fuel reached a low ( in the new CPI series ) of 3.8 per cent in June 2017 , reflecting subdued price pressures and favourable base effects .
Since then it has increased steadily till December 2017 and stayed around 5.2 per cent during Q4 : 2017-18 , largely driven by prices of miscellaneous goods and services , and housing , which includes the statistical effect of HRA hikes .
Adjusting for the impact of HRA , annual average inflation in excluding food and fuel group stood lower by around 40 bps at 4.2 per cent during 2017-18 .
Net of housing , inflation excluding food and fuel averaged 4.1 per cent in 2017-18 , down from 4.7 per cent in the previous year .
The increase in HRA for central government employees became effective from July 2017 and its impact on housing inflation peaked in December 2017 .
This impact has gradually started waning from July 2018 and is expected to fade away fully by December 2018 .
For policy purposes , more than the direct impact of the HRA hike , a major part of which is purely statistical in nature , the second- round effects through the channel of inflation expectations would require careful monitoring .
Moreover , the implementation of HRA by various state governments during 2018-19 could pose an upside risk to the inflation trajectory .
Within the miscellaneous group , inflation in transport and communication prices edged lower during the second half of the year to 2.3 per cent from 3.1 per cent in the first half , mainly on account of cuts in excise duties on retail prices of petrol and diesel by ₹ 2 per litre in October 2017 and the delayed pass-through of the rise in international crude oil prices during November-December .
During 2017-18 , price of the Indian basket crude oil reached its intra- year low of USD 46.6 per barrel in June 2017 in line with global crude oil prices .
Moderation in prices of communication services - telephone and internet charges - largely reflected increased competition among service providers .
Amongst other miscellaneous components , inflation in education prices moderated during the second half of the year , while the remaining components - _ health , recreation and amusement , household goods and services , and personal care and effects - recorded a pick-up in the second half , partly reflecting hikes in customs duties on items like TV LED panels , mobile handsets , footwear as well as an increase in gold prices .
For the year as a whole , sectoral CPI inflation based on Consumer Price Index of Agricultural Labourers ( CPI-AL ) and Consumer Price Index of Rural Labourers ( CPI-RL ) , which do not have housing components , eased in line with overall CPI inflation , while the inflation in Consumer Price Index of Industrial Workers ( CPI-IW ) and Consumer Price Index-Combined ( CPI-C ) converged in January 2018 .
The housing index under the CPI-IW is adjusted twice a year in January and July ( in contrast with the continuous adjustment under CPI-C as a sixth of the sample gets covered every month ) .
Therefore , the impact of the implementation of HRA was reflected in CPI-IW in January 2018 .
Inflation measured by the WPI increased , while the GDP deflator based measure decreased during 2017-18 .
The rise in global crude oil prices , the hardening of metal prices due to the crackdown on polluting industries by China , and strengthening global growth spurred a rise in input costs and contributed to the turnaround in domestic farm and non-farm input costs during 2017-18 .
Moderate increases in MSPs _ were announced during 2017-18 for cereals .
Crops such as cotton and coarse grains , particularly bajra and ragi , received major hikes in their MSPs , and the government continued to incentivise the production of pulses and oilseeds by raising their MSPs .
The role of MSPs in influencing the inflation trajectory in India has been an issue of intense academic and public policy debate .
While some studies indicate MSPs to be a major determinant of inflation ( Kapur and Behera , 2012 ) , others suggest limited impact ( Sonna et ai , 2014 ) .
There is also a view that MSPs may not have an independent impact on inflation ( Lahiri , 2014 ) .
While empirical findings are mixed , the announcement by the government in the Union Budget 2018-19 to fix the MSPs at 1.5 times of cost of farm production effective kharif season 2018 warrants a reassessment of the impact of MSPs on the inflation trajectory .
The government announces MSPs for 23 major crops prior to their sowing seasons to ensure guaranteed prices to farmers and protection from price fluctuations and market imperfections .
Of these 23 items , 16 can be mapped to the CPI basket .
Against this backdrop , a dynamic panel regression model is estimated using Generalised Method of Moments ( GMM ) in view of the possible problem of endogeneity ( i.e. , MSPs inducing a positive production response , and higher production requiring lower increases in MSPs ) to assess the aggregate impact of MSPs on inflation of the 16 items under the new CPI-C series over the period 2011-12 to 2017-18 :
Accordingly , the retail price of a crop in a state is modelled as a function of MSP , production , procurement and international prices , i.e. , the information that enters into fixation of MSPs by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices ( CACP ) .
International prices and lagged retail prices are used as control variables .
In view of the use of lagged dependent variable as an explanatory variable , the Arellano-Bond estimation procedure is used which produces consistent estimates .
The results of the baseline model are presented in Table 2 .
They show that MSP has a positive and statistically significant effect on retail prices of all crops , although it varies significantly across crops .
In general , it has a stronger effect for those crops where procurement is substantial , such as paddy and wheat .
The actual impact of the MSP hike for 2018-19 kharif season , however , would depend on the procurement strategy of the government as well as the ruling market prices of various crops vis-a-vis the revised MSPs .
Growth in nominal rural wages , both for agricultural and non-agricultural labourers , generally moderated from August 2017 , partly reflecting the lagged effects of softer inflation .
A survey conducted during August-September 2016 in six Indian states , viz . , Gujarat , Kerala , Odisha , Punjab , Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal , shows that casual labour households are more likely to Secure work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme ( MGNREGS ) , which can potentially lead to a shortage of labour and upward pressure on wages .
In this context , India ' s Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme ( MGNREGS ) launched under the MGNREG Act , 2005 has been ranked as the world ' s largest public works programme , providing a social security net to almost 15 per cent of the country ' s population ( World Bank , 2015 ) .
Its bottom-up , people- centred , demand-driven , self-selecting , rights-based design is innovative and unprecedented .
However , while the scheme aims to provide 100 days of employment , the average employment provided remained below 50 days at the all-India level with marked divergence across states ( Chart 1 ) .
Furthermore , there are discernible differences in implementation of the scheme across states .
Two states i.e. , Tamil Nadu and West Bengal , accounted for nearly one-fourth of employment provided through MGNREGS , which was more than their share in total rural households .
Maharashtra and Bihar , which have a higher share in total rural households , generated comparatively lower employment through MGNREGS ( Chart 2 ) .
The survey revealed that more than half of the respondents were otherwise unemployed in Kerala , Gujarat and Punjab , while in Uttar Pradesh , Odisha and West Bengal , they were largely employed as agricultural labourers .
The survey results also showed that ( i ) in all the surveyed states , only a few avoided MGNREGS work for alternate employment , and ( ii ) the avoidance of traditional labour for MGNREGS was different across states and across labour groups .
The shift to MGNREGS from traditional employment is more in case of casual labour households and is more evident in Odisha ( 75 per cent ) , Uttar Pradesh ( 66 per cent ) and West Bengal ( 42.5 per cent ) rather than Punjab ( 29.6 per cent ) , Kerala ( 24.1 per cent ) and Gujarat ( 8.3 per cent ) .
For the analysis , avoidance of traditional employment for MGNREGS was taken as the dependent variable .
Given the dichotomous dependent variable , a non-linear regression model was used .
Heckman ' s sample selection model was applied to address the likely specification bias in the model .
The p value and Wald statistic in the Heckman model turned out to be insignificant , indicating absence of correlation between error terms of selection and outcome equations .
Accordingly , a probit model was used for estimating the regression taking only the respondents who are employed other than under MGNREGS .
The dependent variable takes the value 1 when the respondents shift from traditional employment to MGNREGS and zero otherwise ;
The results show that for a casual labourer in agriculture , the probability of avoiding traditional work increases by 19 per cent , while in the non-agriculture casual labour category , this is 11 per cent .
The difference in wages ( actual minus MGNREGS ) was significant with a negative relationship ( the probability impact of this is small at 0.0003 per cent ) .
The current inflation outlook is clouded by several uncertainties .
First , the staggered impact of HRA increases by various state governments may push up headline inflation in 2018-19 , and potentially induce second-round effects .
Second , a pick-up in global growth and / or geopolitical risks may exert further pressure on crude oil and commodity prices , with implications for domestic inflation .
If and when the scheme is implemented fully , it has the potential to create shortages in labour supply in the casual labour category , propelling a wage increase in this segment .
However , if the scheme is designed judiciously so as to provide employment during off seasons , it can be complementary to traditional employment by offering a fall back option .
Such complementarities were evident in West Bengal to the extent that the work schedule was adjusted to the seasonality of traditional employment .
Third , at this stage , there is considerable uncertainty about the full impact of the MSPs for kharif crops on inflation .
Fourth , volatility in global financial markets continues to impart uncertainty to the inflation outlook .
On the downside , the recent pick-up in monsoon , after the initial lull , in conjunction with comfortable carry-over stocks from the current year on the back of record foodgrains production could help in containing food price pressures .
Trade / tariff wars could end up being a drag on the global recovery and moderate inflation by weakening aggregate demand .
Overall , there is a need for vigilance around the evolving inflation scenario in the coming months of the year .
Money supply ( M3 ) was driven up by scheduled commercial banks ' ( SCBs ' ) credit growth , which witnessed a revival from its historic low in March 2017 and re-emerged as a significant source of financing for the commercial sector .
Against this backdrop , the immediately following sub-section on reserve money ( RM ) brings to the fore , the sustained dominance of foreign exchange assets as the largest source of RM during the year .
The follow-up section on M3 documents the contrasting variations between H1 and H2 of 2017-18 as the effects of demonetisation waned ; it also addresses cryptocurrency developments in the global and Indian context .
The turnaround in credit in 201 7- 18 is investigated at both macro and sectoral levels in sub-section 3 with implications for the aggregate resource flow to the commercial sector .
During 2017-18 , the evolution of RM - a stylised depiction of the Reserve Bank ' s balance sheet that focuses on ' moneyness ' - was primarily conditioned by the remonetisation of currency in circulation with newly designed notes of denomination of ₹ 10 , ₹ 50 , ₹ 200 , ₹ 500 and ₹ 2000 .
Keeping in view the urgent need to make available adequate cash to all parts of the country at the shortest possible time , concerted efforts were made by the Reserve Bank and the printing presses to augment the production and supply of new banknotes .
In Q1 : 2017-18 , remonetisation efforts shifted into overdrive to engineer a quick recovery from the shock of demonetisation .
Currency in circulation ( CiC ) , the major driver of RM , increased by around ₹ 4.9 trillion on a year-on-year basis .
While the CiC as on March 31 , 2018 accounted for 101.8 per cent of its pre-demonetisation level , it works out to around 88 per cent of its underlying 3-year trend had there been no _ demonetisation ( Chart II.3.1 ) .
In consonance , the use of digital payments , which had surged to a peak in December 2016 in the aftermath of demonetisation fell back to the elevated post- demonetisation trend before rising in recent months .
Amongst other components of RM , bankers ' balances with the Reserve Bank grew at a moderate pace , reflecting the deceleration in bank deposits during the year .
Banks ' average daily cash balances , nonetheless , turned out to be 101.1 per cent of the cash reserve ratio ( CRR ) prescription , with the demand for excess reserves moderated by the persistence of surplus liquidity conditions throughout the year , barring the episodes of tightness in Q4 : 2017-18 ( Chart II.3.2 ) .
Turning to the sources , net foreign exchange assets of the Reserve Bank rose to account for 114.1 per cent of RM on March 31 , 2018 , up from the preceding 5-year average of around 110 per cent ( Chart II.3.3 ) .
Among other sources , net credit to the government sector declined by around 23.3 per cent due to open market sales by the Reserve Bank as well as higher central government deposits .
In addition , average repo ( average of outstanding on each Friday ) increased to ₹ 2.2 trillion in 2017-18 from ₹ 1.5 trillion a year ago , reflecting de facto excess liquidity adjustment - facility reverse reserves due to the surge in deposits following demonetisation in 2016-17 and low credit offtake till H1 : 2017-18 .
With the gradual increase in CiC , the absorption of liquidity through open market operation ( OMO ) sales beginning July 2017 and the improvement in credit offtake from November 2017 , the liquidity position reversed and LAF absorption gave way to a net repo of % 575 billion trillion a year ago ) .
Higher expenditure by the centre and lower revenues relative to budget estimates in H1 : 2017-18 led to frequent recourse to ways and means advances ( WMA ) from the Reserve Bank , thereby adding to surplus liquidity with the banking system .
Consequently , large amounts parked under reverse repo despite absorption through Market Stabilisation Scheme ( MSS ) T-Bills , OMO sales and the increase in CiC impacted monetary aggregates .
Subsequent to advance tax inflows in September 2017 , government expenditure moderated , which was reflected in a gradual decline in net reverse repo ( Chart II.3.4 ) .
With the introduction of a standing deposit facility , the Reserve Bank will have a new tool to absorb liquidity without collateral constraints ( Box II.3.1 ) .
Movements in money supply ( M3 ) during 2017-18 reflected shifts in the Reserve Bank ' s balance sheet encapsulated in changes in RM in the preceding section as well as broader developments in the economy that impacted banks ' balance sheets .
Consequently , the growth of M3 slumped on a year-on-year basis to reach a historic low of 5.6 per cent as on September 29 , 2017 .
Accordingly , the RBI Act , 1934 has been amended for introduction of an uncollateralised deposit scheme .
The SDF is generally an unlimited , fixed rate and on-tap deposit facility offered by a central bank .
Its introduction would enable the Reserve Bank to suck out liquidity without offering any collateral .
In the Indian context , the SDF was initially proposed by the Bank ' s Internal Group on LAF ( 2003 ) and reiterated by the Working Group on the Operating Procedure of Monetary Policy ( 2011 ) .
Cross-country experience suggests that standing facilities ( SFs ) - deposit and lending - are transparent , available to banks and other counterparties without discretionary hurdles , and are generally considered as the safety valve of a liquidity management system .
The SDF offers market participants an opportunity to deposit their residual surplus that they could not deploy in the market even at a rate significantly lower than the policy rate .
The main advantage of SFs is that they provide the central bank a window to intervene in both directions when needed to achieve the operating interest rate target , with volatility in inter-bank rates restricted to the corridor around the target rate .
M3 growth stood at 9.8 per management .
The SDF , though less in use vis-a-vis the lending facility , has also been used by some countries to define a floor rate in the inter-bank market , especially in liquidity surplus conditions .
According to the IMF ' s latest Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and Compilation Guide ( 2016 ) , reserve money ( RM ) comprises central bank liabilities that support the expansion of credit and broad money .
If the objective of SDF is to facilitate liquidity management , such central bank liabilities to banks would not be counted for reserve requirements and hence , would have to be excluded from RM .
However , if banks ' funds are parked under reserve requirements ( including any excess reserves ) , they are to be treated as part of RM .
The behaviour of M3 essentially mirrored its recently turned volatile component - CwP - which accounted for 12.6 per cent of M3 as on March 31 , 2018 .
Aggregate deposits accounted for around 93 per cent of M3 following their sharp increase in Q3 of 2016-17 due to substitution of CwP by deposits in the post-demonetisation phase .
Both demand deposits and time deposits shared this moderation as the interest rate on deposits eased , with banks transmitting the cumulative reduction of 200 bps in the policy rate by the Reserve Bank almost fully to term deposit rates .
The public disenchantment from lower returns from bank deposits coupled with sobering down of returns from other assets was followed by an interesting development .
A blockchain is a continuous ledger in which transactions are stored as blocks and linked using cryptography .
Cryptocurrency is often allotted through initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) , which are used as a means of raising capital through crowdfunding .
Cryptocurrency typically has some monetary characteristics , but is not a liability of any entity and is not backed by any authority .
Its value is driven by users ' confidence in it .
Notably , Bitcoins lost nearly US $ 200 billion in market capitalisation in about two months from the peak value in December 2017 .
As per the CoinMarketCap , the overall cryptocurrency market had nearly touched US $ 800 billion in January 2018 .
The cryptocurrency eco-system may affect the existing payment and settlement system which could , in turn , influence the transmission of monetary policy .
There exists a high possibility of its usage for illicit activities , including tax avoidance .
The absence of information on counterparties in such peer-to-peer | anonymous / pseudonymous systems could subject users to unintentional breaches of anti-money laundering laws ( AML ) as well as laws for combating the financing of terrorism ( CFT ) ( Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures - CPMI , 2015 ) .
The Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) has recently warned that the emergence of cryptocurrencies has become a combination of a bubble , a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster , and calls for policy responses ( BIS , 2018 ) .
China ' s exchanges hosted a disproportionately large volumes of global Bitcoin trading until their ban recently .
In India , the government and the Reserve Bank are keeping a close watch on cryptocurrency and have issued pre-emptive cautionary warnings .
Regulated entities which already provide such services were asked to exit the relationship within three months .
Developments on this front need to be monitored as some trading may shift from exchanges to peer-to-peer mode , which may also involve increased usage of cash .
Possibilities of migration of crypto exchange houses to dark pools / cash and to offshore locations , thus raising concerns on AML / CFT and taxation issues , require close watch .
During the year , monetary ratios such as the currency-deposit ( C / D ) ratio and the money multiplier ( MM ) exhibited behaviour in contrast to the pattern observed in the previous year .
Rapid changes in the landscape of the payments industry , along with factors such as emergence of private digital tokens and the rising costs of managing fiat paper / metallic money , have led central banks around the world to explore the option of introducing fiat digital currencies .
In India , an inter-departmental group has been constituted by the Reserve Bank to study and provide guidance on the desirability and feasibility to introduce a central bank digital currency .
Adjusted for reverse repo ( net ) with banks - analytically akin to banks ' deposits with the central bank - the MM would turn out to be vis 5.5 a year ago .
However , the reserve-deposit ( R / D ) ratio remained broadly stable , reflecting the unchanged CRR during the year ( Chart II.3.6 ) .
Nonetheless , momentum also provided tailwinds , indicating an upswing in credit in tune with gradually improving domestic demand conditions ( Chart II.3.7 ) .
Among PSBs , those under prompt corrective action ( PCA ) turned out to be laggards , though signs of revival were evident in this category as well during 2018-19 so far ( Chart II.3.8 ) .
The growth in credit to agriculture decelerated during 2017-18 when compared to a year ago .
This might be indicative of pressures in the farm sector as corroborated by agriculture debt waivers announced in some states .
Credit to industry turned around from a contraction of 1.9 per centin March 2017 to apositive 0.7 per cent in March 2018 ( Table II.3.2 ) .
Industrial credit , which had shrunk for most part of 2017-18 , recovered from November 2017 onwards .
A pick-up was witnessed across sectors such as _ textiles ; vehicles , vehicle parts and transport equipment ; engineering ; food processing ; and rubber , plastic and products .
In contrast , credit to infrastructure , which accounted for about one-third of bank credit to industry , contracted in a broad-based manner ( by 1.7 per cent in March 2018 ) , pulled down by power , telecommunications and roads .
The growth in credit to services decelerated , led by segments like trade and professional services .
Credit card outstanding - a small component in overall credit - recorded deceleration given its high base as also due to sluggishness in demand for consumer durables .
Education loans contracted , indicative of aversion of banks in respect of lending to riskier sectors .
All major sectors , barring agriculture , witnessed an acceleration in June 2018 .
Credit to major sub-sectors such as textiles , engineering , food processing , chemical and chemical products and cement and cement products accelerated .
However , credit to basic metal and metal products , construction and gems and jewellery contracted / declined .
Services witnessed a sharp surge driven by trade and non-banking financial companies ( NBFCs ) ( Table II.3.2 ) .
The total flow of financial resources to the commercial sector increased by 27.1 per cent during 2017-18 as compared to an increase of 3.8 per cent in the previous year .
However , there was a significant increase in public issuance of equities by non- financial entities , credit disbursement by housing finance companies and accommodation by four All India Financial Institutions ( AIFls ) regulated by the Reserve Bank .
Among foreign sources , external commercial borrowings ( ECB ) / foreign currency convertible bonds ( FCCB ) recorded net outflows for the third consecutive year albeit of a much lower magnitude during the year .
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) flows declined by 10.3 per cent during the year , mainly due to higher repatriation in the second half of the year ( Table II.3.3 ) .
In Summary , while key monetary and credit aggregates picked up on signs of stronger economic activity in the second half of 2017- 18 , they remained muted in relation to their historical record .
Credit conditions remained tight for the major part of the year as the Reserve away surplus liquidity and bond yields hardened liquidity operations steadily drained in response to perceptions of higher supply of government papers , higher than budgeted fiscal deficit numbers and some uncertainty around the inflation outlook .
Additionally , conversion of two large NBFCs viz . , Bandhan and IDFC into banks during the year also contributed to the decline in credit flows to the commercial sector .
Credit to services and personal loans remained resilient during the year .
Non-bank sources of credit played an important role , especially domestic sources thereof .
Barring the sell-offs in equities and bonds in February and March 2018 that ricocheted across the world , including in India , global financial markets remained generally upbeat in 2017-18 on improving growth prospects and a gradual pace of normalisation by the US Fed .
By contrast , other market segments were mostly influenced by domestic factors .
In the money market , as discussed in sub-section 1 , money market rates remained anchored to the policy rate due to active liquidity management by the Reserve Bank .
Sub- section 4 portrays developments in the domestic stock market , which remained buoyant on the back of positive domestic factors and cues from global markets .
The two-way movements in the Indian rupee-US dollar ( INR-US $ ) exchange rate , generally appreciating in H1 on significant foreign portfolio investment ( FPI ) inflows but depreciating in H2 on general strengthening of the US dollar and FPI outflows , have been discussed in sub- section 5 .
However , the Reserve Bank conducted variable rate term repo auctions of different tenors to address additional demand for liquidity that is usually observed in March every year .
It may be mentioned that this decline in the negative spread over the policy rate reflected the narrowing of the spread in respect of both ' traded deals ' , which are the call money deals directly transacted on the electronic , negotiated and quote-driven platform for trading , the NDS-CALL and ' reported deals ' which are over-the-counter ( OTC ) call deals subsequently reported on the NDS-CALL platform .
During Q1 of 2018-19 , the negative spread of the WACR over the policy rate averaged around 10 bps .
Even as spreads narrowed , volatility in the call money segment , measured by conditional variance , ebbed and turnover remained broadly unchanged .
In 2017-18 , call transactions constituted less than 10 per cent of the total money market volume .
Collateralised money market instruments are the Collateralised Borrowing and Lending Obligation ( CBLO ) and market repo .
In the CBLO segment , banks are usually the major borrowers , while mutual funds ( MFs ) are the major lenders .
In the market repo segment , however , banks are the major players both on the borrowing and the lending sides ; the other participants being Primary Dealers ( PDs ) mainly as borrowers ( with a share of 28 per cent ) and mutual funds as lenders ( with a share of 30 per cent ) .
Trading volumes and rates in the CBLO segment decline sharply on reporting Fridays with corresponding increases in the market repo segment .
This is because borrowings in the market repo segment are exempted from the cash reserve ratio ( CRR ) requirement , whereas borrowings in the CBLO market are not .
Average daily volume in the money market ( call money , CBLO and market repo ) increased by 17 per cent to ₹ 1,687 billion during 2017-18 from ₹ 1,441 billion in 2016-17 .
Volumes in the CBLO and market repo segments increased by 25 per cent and 10 per cent , respectively , whereas in the call money segment , they decreased by 8 per cent during the year .
Call money , CBLO and market repo segments accounted for 8 per cent , 63 per cent and 29 per cent , respectively , of the total volume during 2017-18 as compared with 11 per cent , 59 per cent and 30 per cent , respectively , in 2016-17 .
Furthermore , trading in the call money , CBLO and market repo segments are predominantly for overnight lending / borrowing and accounted for 97 per cent , 91 per cent and 88 per cent of volumes , respectively , during 2017- 18 .
During Q1 of 2018-19 , average daily volume in money market moderated to ₹ 1,649 billion .
In the certificates of deposit ( CDs ) market , primary issuances of CDs by banks declined during the first half of the year , reflecting the post- demonetisation surplus liquidity in the banking system .
However , issuances picked-up from October 2017 due to the progressive decline in surplus liquidity .
The average fortnightly issuance of CDs went up from ₹ 122 billion in H1 of 2017-18 to ₹ 216 billion during H2 .
In Q1 of 2018-19 , the average fortnightly issuance of CDs declined to ₹ 159 billion .
In the commercial paper ( CP ) market , the average fortnightly primary issuance of CPs increased to ₹ 955 billion during 2017-18 from ₹ 867 billion during the previous year , partly reflecting the substitution of short-term bank credit with market based funding by highly rated corporates on account of lower funding costs relative to bank loans .
With money market rates on an easing mode across the board on account of the surplus liquidity condition and reduction in the policy rate , the weighted average discount rate ( WADR ) on CPs exhibited a downward bias during the year barring a mild hardening in Q4 , a typical year-end phenomenon .
In Q1 of 2018-19 , the average fortnightly primary issuance of CPs stood at ₹ 939 billion , and the WADR on CPs mostly hardened .
The monthly average volume _ of transactions in central government and state governments dated securities ( G-secs and SDLs ) and T-Bills ( outright as well as repo ) declined by 15.7 per cent during 2017-18 , mainly due to valuation losses on account of the hardening of yields almost continuously from August 2017 .
During 2018-19 , until end-June 2018 , the monthly average volume recorded further decline of 10.2 per cent .
A combination of factors , viz . , rising inflation , announcement effects of monetary policy in the US and fears of fiscal slippage by the Government of India ( Gol ) , triggered the hardening .
In fact , the reduction in the policy rate by the Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) in its August 2017 meeting failed to enthuse the market .
The announcement of the schedule for tapering off of reinvestment of maturing bonds by the US Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) tightened yields even further in September .
Yields continued to trade on an elevated note through Q3 in an environment of rising inflation , firming crude oil prices , announcement effects surrounding the intention of Gol to engage in additional borrowing of ₹ 500 billion and concerns over weak revenue collection through the GST .
Pessimism stemming from the impact of the imminent issuance of public sector bank ( PSB ) recapitalisation bonds and consequent over supply of paper in the market also weighed down bond prices .
The upgrade of India ' s sovereign rating by Moody ' s Investors Service and the cancellation of scheduled OMO sale by the Reserve Bank in November 2017 calmed sentiments briefly .
However , G-sec yields started hardening again during December 2017 due to the announcement of additional borrowing of ₹ 500 billion by the Gol , rising crude oil prices and higher inflation prints .
During March 2018 , domestic yields started trading with a softer bias , aided by absence of fresh supply of papers during the month , the Gol ' s announcement of lower market borrowing in H1 of 2018-19 and maturing of ₹ 1 trillion worth of MSS T-Bills , which allayed liquidity shortage related concerns .
Subsequently , the yields started hardening on higher crude oil price , higher CPI inflation print and increased SDL supply .
Additionally , hardening of global bond yields , rising trade related tensions and policy rate hikes by the US Fed and the Reserve Bank also impacted the market sentiment .
Intermittent softening in global crude oil prices and OMO purchases by the Reserve Bank helped in ameliorating the adverse impact , to an extent , thereby capping the hardening of yields .
The domestic 10-year benchmark security yield closed at 7.90 per cent on June 29 , 2018 .
The corporate bond market has been boosted by a number of measures taken to develop the market in recent years .
Net outstanding corporate bonds increased by 14 per cent y-o-y to ₹ 27.4 trillion by end-March 2018 , about 16.3 per cent of GDP .
The average daily turnover in the corporate bond market also increased sharply to ₹ 74.6 billion during 2017-18 from ₹ 61.0 billion a year ago .
Furthermore , proposals contained in the Union Budget 2018-19 , such as , mandating large corporates to use the bond market to finance one-fourth of their funding needs , lowering the regulatory investment grade to ' A ' from ' AA ' , and the introduction of uniform stamp duty for issuance of bonds across the country , have paved the way for further development of the corporate bond market .
However , this reversed in H2 of 2017-18 with corporate bond yields hardening persistently in tandem with the increase in G-sec yields and episodes of hardening of bond yields witnessed globally .
Overall , the 5-year AAA rated corporate bond yield increased by 39 bps to 7.96 per cent during 2017-18 .
Primary corporate bond issuances declined by 9.8 per cent to ₹ 6,043 billion during 2017-18 from the peak level of ₹ 6,700 billion in 2016-17 , which had surpassed the total bank credit extended during the year .
The surge in bond yields in H2 tightened financial conditions , resulting in corporates shifting to bank credit for meeting their funding requirements .
Public corporate debt issuances at ₹ 51.9 billion during 2017-18 were the lowest in the past eight years , as 99.1 per cent of the entire resource mobilisation from the corporate bond market was effected through the private placement route .
FPI presence in corporate bond market increased to ₹ 2.2 trillion as at end-March 2018 from ₹ 1.9 trillion at end-March 2017 .
The yield spread of 5-year AAA rated corporate bond over 5-year G-sec widened by 24 bps .
Consequently , primary issuances in corporate bond market declined by 33.6 per cent to ₹ 1,161 billion in Q1 of 2018-19 as compared with the corresponding period of the preceding year .
The average daily turnover in the corporate bond market has increased to ₹ 75.0 billion in Q1 of 2018-19 as compared with ₹ 72.4 billion in Q1 of 2017-18 .
The BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 increased by 11.3 per cent and 10.2 per cent , respectively , on the back of a combination of positive factors such as improved domestic macro-economic fundamentals and rallies in global markets ( Chart II.4.4 ) .
The buoyancy in the domestic equity market was largely sustained by purchases by domestic mutual funds , though FPls also lent support in the net .
Commencing the year on a positive note , equity markets registered gains during April-May 2017 on the anticipation of a normal monsoon , the amendment to the Banking Regulation Act to tackle stressed assets , a sharp fall in retail inflation and finalisation of the GST rates .
However , the market turned volatile soon after , with the equity indices registering declines during June 2017 following the announcement of farm loan waivers by some state governments , the Reserve Bank stipulating higher provisioning for bank loans submitted under the insolvency process and the second interest rate hike in 2017 by the US Fed .
Buoyancy returned to the equity market in July 2017 after the introduction of GST and release of the minutes of the US Fed ' s June meeting , which reflected a lack of consensus on the future pace of rate hikes .
However , market sentiment was adversely impacted in August 2017 by lower than expected corporate earnings for Q1 of 2017-18 .
Bearish sentiment continued to prevail in September 2017 on concerns relating to fiscal slippage , net selling by FPls , geo-political tensions in the Korean peninsula and the US Fed ' s announcement of balance sheet reduction / tapering off of reinvestment of maturing securities from October 2017 .
However , the market bounced back sharply in October on announcement of measures to recapitalise PSBs , improving macroeconomic conditions , upbeat corporate earnings results for Q2 of 2017-18 and revival of FPI .
This was followed by a correction in November , notwithstanding a sharp jump in India ' s ranking in the World Bank ' s ease of doing business and the ratings upgrade by Moody ' s , but the rally resumed in December triggered by Gujarat assembly election results and positive global cues .
The upswing gathered strength in January 2018 with the Sensex crossing the 36,000 mark and touching a historic high - 36,283 on January 29 - on positive cues from global markets , the upbeat macroeconomic outlook , encouraging corporate earnings results in Q3 of 2017-18 and optimism ahead of the Union Budget .
This buoyancy was , however , associated with heightened volatility , particularly from the second half of January 2018 ( Box II.4.1 ) .
The VIX , which is based on options in the S & P 500 index , measures market expectations of future volatility of the broad US stock market over the next 30 days .
In India , the National Stock Exchange ( NSE ) introduced India VIX in March 2009 using the computation methodology of the CBOE , with suitable amendments .
The best bid-ask quotes of near and next-month Nifty options contracts , which are traded on the futures and options segment of the NSE , are used for computation of the India VIX which reflects not only investors ' expectations of volatility but also the premium they require to bear volatility risk .
Negative return shocks have a larger impact on implied volatility than positive return shocks .
The negative correlation between implied volatility and the stock return is based on two fundamental hypotheses : the volatility feedback effect and the leverage effect .
The volatility feedback hypothesis ( French et al . , 1987 ) posits that a sharp fall in the stock price leads to an increase in the risk premium due to anticipated increase in volatility , leading to an increase in VIX .
In India , the long term inverse relationship between India VIX and Nifty 50 turned positive during the second half of January 2018 when both the indices increased in tandem ( correlation coefficient = 0.88 for January 2018 ) .
Global markets also witnessed a similar phenomenon as the S & P 500 and VIX moved together during that period ( correlation coefficient = 0.70 ) .
The volatility in the global market was exacerbated by collapse of several complex volatility-linked funds and algorithmic trading strategies tied to market volatility .
An estimation of the relationship between Nifty 50 and India VIX over a longer period , / .e. , January 2009 to April 2018 , indicated a significantly negative correlation between the two [ ( - ) 0.72 ] ( Table 1 and Chart 1 ) .
To assess the asymmetric nature of relationship between changes in the Nifty 50 index and India VIX for the period January 2010-January 2018 , Newey-West estimator based regression has been used to overcome heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation in the error terms .
Dummy variables have been used for positive and negative returns ( Giot , 2005 ) .
Additionally , realised volatility of stock returns , represented by conditional variance estimated through GARCH , and implied volatility , represented by VIX in the case of both Nifty 50 and S & P 500 , generally moved in tandem .
realised volatility generally remained lower than expected volatility .
However , during periods of extreme volatility , realised volatility estimated through GARCH rose above the implied volatility ( Chart 2 ) .
Buoyancy returned to the equity market in 2018-19 with the BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 increasing by 7.4 per cent and 5.9 per cent , respectively ,
After increasing sharply during April 2018 , the markets witnessed intermittent corrections during May-June 2018 , on concerns relating to prospects of trade related tensions between the US and China , political uncertainty in Karnataka , surge in crude oil prices and interest rate hike by the US Fed .
Sustained net investments by institutional investors , particularly mutual funds , during the year , provided upside momentum to equity markets , even as foreign portfolio flows turned volatile ( Chart 11.4.5 ) .
Net investment by mutual funds in equities during the year at ₹ 1,418 billion was much higher than ₹ 223 billion by foreign portfolio investors .
During Q1 of 2018-19 , mutual funds made net purchase of ₹ 335 billion , while foreign portfolio investors registered net sales of ₹ 204 billion .

During September-November 2017 , a sharp rise in IPO activity was led by insurance companies , which accounted for 52 per cent of the total resources raised through IPOs in 2017-18 .
The net resource mobilisation by mutual funds declined by 20.8 per cent to ₹ 2,718 billion in 2017-18 .
Accordingly , assets under management ( AUM ) of equity oriented schemes of mutual funds increased by 37.9 per cent from ₹ 5.4 trillion at end-March 2017 to ₹ 27.5 trillion at end-March 2018 .
Primary market resource mobilisation through public issues of equity declined by 31.5 per cent ( y-o-y ) during Q1 of 2018-19 .
QIP issues also declined significantly by 85.2 per cent during Q1 of 2018-19 .
The net resources mobilisation by mutual funds increased by 43.4 per cent during Q1 of 2018-19 .
In the foreign exchange market , turnover picked up amidst broadly stable conditions during 2017-18 .
The INR traded with an appreciating bias against the US dollar in H1 of 2017-18 before depreciating in September 2017 .
However , geo-political tensions and the portfolio purchases , especially US Fed ' s announcement of commencement of normalisation of monetary policy pulled the INR down in September 2017 .
market and a weakening US dollar supported FPI purchases in the Indian debt the market in December and early January .
However , re-emergence of concerns around the repercussions of elevated energy prices on India ' s current account deficit ( CAD ) , uncertainty around recalibration of the speed of monetary policy tightening by the US Fed upon arrival of strong wages and employment data , and the introduction of the long term capital gains ( LTCG ) tax domestically exerted downward pressure on the INR in the second half of January and in February .
These pressures were accentuated by the strengthening of the US dollar , sales by FPls in the equity and debt markets in India , and upward revision of fiscal deficit targets by the Gol .
Overall , the rupee depreciated marginally by 0.3 per cent at end-March 2018 from its level a year ago although it appreciated in 2017-18 relative to the previous year on an average basis .
Rupee remained generally weak during Q1 of 2018-19 tracking broad-based gains in US dollar , sustained rise in crude oil prices and persistent FPI outflows from the Indian debt segment .
The rupee staged intermittent recovery , especially towards end-May , due to softening of crude oil prices on prospects of higher production and better than expected Q4 growth but the gains could not be sustained in June due to significant hardening of crude oil prices , increase in CAD for Q4 of 2017-18 , rate hike by the US Fed and intensification of trade related tensions between the US and China .
Forward premia recovered from post- demonetisation lows during 2017-18 , although they continued to rule easy , reflecting the stability in the spot market .
Turnover in both merchant and the inter-bank segments of the spot market and swap segment picked up , whereas the forward segment exhibited a minor reduction in activity .
Going forward , global risk factors like geo- political developments in the Middle-East leading to sharp increase in crude oil prices , faster than anticipated pace of rate hike by the US Fed and increase in protectionism leading to prospects of trade related tensions could induce volatility in the domestic financial markets .
However , sound domestic macro-economic fundamentals would provide a strong bulwark against any externally induced volatility spillovers .
In 2017-18 , public finances were marked by deviations from budgetary deficit targets at both central and sub-national levels , essentially from the revenue account .
For the central government , the pressure points turned out to be indirect tax collections , non-tax revenue and revenue expenditure .
The shortfall in non-tax revenue relative to budget estimates ( BE ) needs to be viewed in the context of deferment of spectrum auctions , the acute stress in balance sheets of banks and corporates that eroded profitability , and the costs of demonetisation impinging on the balance sheet of the Reserve Bank .
With revenue expenditure programmed to expand due to upward revisions in salaries , pensions and allowances of central government employees and defence personnel , capital expenditure had to be pruned from the budgeted amount .
In the event , the provisional accounts ( PA ) for 2017-18 show that the centre ' s gross fiscal deficit ( GFD ) at 3.5 per cent of GDP was higher than the budgeted 3.2 per cent of GDP .
The consolidated GFD of states in 2017-18 as per revised estimates ( RE ) at 3.1 per cent of GDP exceeded the budgeted target ( 2.7 per cent of GDP ) .
The main underlying factors were shortfall in own tax revenues and higher revenue expenditure on account of pay commission award and farm loan waivers .
For 2018-19 , the centre ' s GFD is budgeted at 3.3 percent of GDP , a reduction of 0.2 percentage points over the 2017-18 level .
The fiscal deficit target of 3.0 per cent has been deferred to 2020- 21 .
In case of states , the budget estimates of the consolidated fiscal deficit at 2.6 per cent need to be seen in light of the recent historical record and the gaps in the institutional architecture , the latter attracting new scrutiny in the context of the farm loan waivers and the implementation of the pay commission recommendations .
Notwithstanding some moderation in the post crisis period , the general government GFD has remained above 6.5 per cent of GDP since 2012-13 .
It is estimated to be around 6.6 per cent in 2017-18 ( RE ) and is budgeted at 5.9 per cent in 2018-19 .
The fiscal strategy for 2017-18 was centered on the rural economy , infrastructure and poverty alleviation while persevering with structural reforms , including in-budgetary processes such as the advancement of the budget presentation to February 1 , merger of the railway budget with the Union Budget , and the abolition of the plan and non-plan classification of expenditure .
In terms of actual outcomes , centre ' s tax revenues net of devolution to states exceeded the budgeted amount by 1.3 per cent , sustaining the upturn in the tax / GDP ratio that commenced in 2016-17 .
Underlying this improvement , gross direct tax revenues were buoyed by higher collections under income and corporate taxes , with growth rates of 12.0 per cent and 17.8 per cent , respectively .
With corporate tax buoyancy being higher than in 2016-17 , corporate tax collections also exceeded the budget estimates of 2017-18 .
Unlike the direct tax to GDP ratio , the indirect tax to GDP ratio declined marginally in 2017-18 , although collections exceeded the previous year ' s receipts by 5.9 per cent .
Non-tax revenues recorded a shortfall of 33.3 per cent from budgetary targets , mainly on account of lower receipts from interest , dividends and profits .
The Reserve Bank transferred an overall surplus of ₹ 306.6 billion to the government in 2017 as against ₹ 658.8 billion in 2016 , a decline of 53.5 per cent .
In 2017-18 , aggregate dividend receipts were lower by 35.8 per cent than the BE and by 25.7 per cent over their 2016-17 level .
Notably , net receipts from communication services fell short of BE mainly because of deferment of spectrum auctions .
On the other hand , proceeds of ₹ 1 trillion from disinvestment on the back of strategic sales were the highest in any financial year so far and exceeded the BE by 38.2 per cent .
Reflecting these constituent movements , total non-debt capital receipts registered a growth of 77.2 per cent vis-a-vis 3.8 per cent in the previous year .
Revenue expenditure exceeded _ the budget target by 2.3 per cent on account of higher pension and interest payments , absorbing the entire increase in non-debt capital receipts .
Consequently , capital expenditure had to be pruned below the BE by 14.9 per cent in contrast to the healthy improvement in 2016-17 when capital expenditure was protected and the burden of adjustment fell on revenue expenditure .
Reflecting these developments , the budgeted target for GFD-GDP ratio at 3.2 per cent was breached by 0.3 percentage points in 2017- 18 .
The revenue deficit ( RD ) -GDP ratio at 2.6 per cent shows a deviation of 0.7 percentage points from the BE , more than double the deviation in the GFD-GDP ratio ( Table II.5.1 ) .
The Union Budget for 2018-19 renewed the emphasis on reviving rural demand by focusing on the rural economy and agriculture .
In contrast to 2017-18 , the fiscal strategy expanded its ambit to the social sector ( education , health and social welfare ) and maintained its thrust on infrastructure and the financial sector , the latter through the announcement of important measures like bank recapitalisation and introduction of the standing deposit facility .
Although the fiscal cost of bank recapitalisation bonds is yet uncertain , the measure could lend tailwinds to the recent recovery in bank credit and , in turn , overall growth , compensating for any additional interest burden on the government in the interim .
The central government accepted the medium-term fiscal targets recommended by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management ( FRBM ) Review Committee ( Chairman : Shri N. K. Singh ) but with a delayed timetable .
The FRBM Review Committee had recommended a medium term GFD-GDP target of 2.5 per cent for the centre by 2022-23 .
The GFD for 2018-19 , is budgeted at 3.3 per cent of GDP , vis-a-vis the 2017-18 outcome of 3.5 per cent .
Given the expenditure priorities of the fiscal strategy , the realisation of the budgeted GFD hinges on the centre ' s revenue effort - 18.3 per cent growth in gross tax revenues ; 22.3 per cent in indirect taxes with GST collections increasing by 70.5 per cent .
The average buoyancy in personal income tax was higher at 2.5 and 1.2 for 2016-17 and 2017-18 , respectively , as against 1.0 during the seven years from 2009-10 to 2015-16 .
This is attributable to the ongoing tax base broadening and enforcement measures .
Receipts from non- tax revenues are budgeted to increase in 2018- 19 by 27.3 per cent , with major contributions from interest receipts , followed by non-tax receipts of Union Territories .
Encouraged by the disinvestment outcomes in 2017-18 , the target for disinvestment has been projected at ₹ 800 billion in 2018-19 ( BE ) .
Total expenditure is budgeted to grow by 14.0 per cent in 2018-19 ( 8.5 per cent in 2017-18 ) .
Capital outlay ( i.e. , capital expenditure excluding loans and advances ) is projected to grow by 13.9 per cent ( 1.3 per cent decline in 2017-18 ) .
Capital expenditure is budgeted to grow at 13.9 per cent , with emphasis on transport and social welfare ( Chart II.5.1 ) .
Expenditure on major subsidies , viz . , food , fuel and fertiliser is budgeted to rise by 38.3 per cent to 1.4 per cent of GDP from 1.1 per cent of GDP in 2017-18 .
As per the latest information available , RD and GFD , both in absolute terms as well as per cent of BE were lower during April-June 2018 as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year , since the growth in revenue receipts surpassed that in total expenditure .
Non- tax revenue also surged during the quarter .
The growth in total expenditure was mainly driven by capital expenditure .
Fiscal position of 29 state governments at a consolidated level points toward deterioration in key deficit indicators in 2017-18 ( RE ) as against the BE .
The erosion occurred despite no issuances of bonds under the UDAY scheme , which had resulted in higher deficits in the preceding two years .
Revised estimates for 2017-18 indicate a deviation of 0.40 percentage points of GDP in the consolidated states ' revenue deficit and 0.35 percentage points in the GFD from the budget estimates .
The deviation has occurred on account of both overshooting of revenue expenditure by 13 basis points ( bps ) due to farm loan waivers and other factors , which include pay revisions and shortfall of revenue receipts by 27 bps , mainly reflecting a decline in states ' own taxes by 0.33 per cent of GDP .
This shortfall was partly offset by transfers from the centre , which exceeded budget projections by 0.09 per cent of GDP .
For 2018-19 , states have budgeted for a consolidated GFD of 2.6 per cent of GDP .
The correction mainly emanates from the revenue account , which is projected to post a surplus of 0.2 per cent of GDP [ deficit of 0.4 per cent in 2017-18 ( RE ) ] ( Chart II.5.2 ) .
Revenue receipts are expected to go up on account of central transfers and states ' own taxes comprising states ' GST and other commodity taxes .
Notwithstanding the consolidation in GFD-GDP ratio budgeted for 2018-19 , eleven states are projecting a fiscal deficit above the 3 per cent threshold .
Policy models like Quarterly Projection Model ( QPM ) ( Benes et al . , 2016 ) under the Forecasting and Policy Analysis System ( FPAS ) play a critical role in ensuring consistent forward looking assessment and evaluation of the risks to baseline path over the medium term .
In recent past , there have been growing concerns on the implications of the fiscal deficit at central and state levels for durable disinflation and achievement of the target .
Empirical results for the recent period suggest a positive and statistically significant long-run relationship , leading from fiscal deficits to inflation in India , which is non-linear in nature , i.e. , the impact of fiscal deficit on inflation will be higher at higher levels of the fiscal deficit and inflation ( Mitra et al . , 2017 ) .
QPM is a forward-looking open-economy calibrated gap model based on the New-Keynesian framework and incorporates a number of India-specific characteristics of inflation process and monetary policy transmission .
In QPM , fiscal stance influences inflation outcomes through its impact on aggregate demand and exchange rate .
The overall fiscal deficit , based on the IMF and OECD approach , is decomposed into structural and cyclical deficits to arrive at the structural or the underlying fiscal position when cyclical or automatic movements are removed .
Cyclical deficit captures the movements in government revenue and expenditure in line with the rise and fall of economic activity and hence cyclical deficit is modelled as a function of output gap .
Further , the deviation from the long-term debt target will affect the country risk premium and hence the exchange rate through the uncovered interest parity ( UIP ) condition .
Augmenting the fiscal block to the QPM and analysing the historical decomposition of the output gap ( Chart 2 ) in the post-GFC ( i.e. , global financial crisis ) period clearly bring out the role of large fiscal deficit when the FRBM Rule based fiscal consolidation was set on a ' pause ' .
Spending pressures pose further risks , including from farm loan waivers , and ongoing implementation of the pay commission recommendations .
The general government GFD , which was in a consolidation phase from 2012-13 started deteriorating from 2015-16 to reach 7.0 per cent of GDP in 2016-17 .
While the centre sustained its consolidation process during the period , the states used up the fiscal space more than that vacated by the centre , keeping the combined GFD-GDP ratio at an elevated level .
However , the general government GFD is budgeted to be 5.9 per cent of GDP in 2018-19 as against 6.6 per cent in the revised estimates for 2017-18 .
Globally , general government balances across G-20 countries present a mixed picture ( Table II.5.2 ) .
While countries such as Russia and Mexico strengthened fiscal consolidation in 2017 , the situation deteriorated in Argentina , China and South Africa as also in the US and Japan .
Outstanding liabilities of the general government are budgeted to decline to 68.3 per cent of GDP at end-March 2019 from 68.9 per cent at end-March 2018 ( RE ) .
As per the revised FRBM architecture , the aim is to attain a central government debt to GDP ratio of 40 per cent and a general government debt to GDP ratio of 60 per cent by 2024-25 .
The definition of central government debt has also been widened to include all outstanding liabilities , including those in the Public Accounts .
Though the current debt levels are above the FRBM target , the debt servicing capacity of the general government has improved over the previous two years with the interest payments as per cent to revenue receipts exhibiting a decline ( Chart II.5.3 ) .
The central government reported an expansionary fiscal impulse for 2017-18 , driven by underperformance in non-tax revenue , indirect taxes and revenue expenditure .
Going forward , centre and states may have to withstand revenue expenditure pressures due to farm loan waivers , pay commission recommendations for states , likely rise in fuel subsidies and a higher interest burden associated with rising market borrowings and elevated yields .
However , the broadened tax base achieved through structural reforms coupled with enhanced GST compliance and increased tax efficiency via successful implementation of the E-way bill , could help both centre and states in meeting these pressures successfully and in getting back to the path of fiscal consolidation over the medium term .
This will help assuage market sentiment , in turn contributing towards lower interest and debt burden for the general government .
Just as the international environment was improving with global trade outpacing global growth in 2017 and capital flows to EMEs rebounding after bouts of reversals during 2013- 16 , it has been unsettled by the intensification of protectionism and retaliatory strategies that threaten to rend asunder the institutional fabric of multilateral trade .
Against this backdrop , India ' s external sector exhibited resilience in the face of terms of trade losses due to the firming up of international crude prices and domestic supply constraints .
While the level of India ' s net international investment position ( NIIP ) deteriorated modestly with the increase in liabilities in the form of direct and portfolio investment as shown in sub-section 6 , performance of other external vulnerability indicators was somewhat mixed over the year though there was a sizable accretion to international reserves .
Global trade volume , which emerged towards the close of 2016 out of a 20-month sub-3 per cent y-o-y growth , gained strength and traction through 2017 peaking at 6.1 per cent in March 2017 ( Chart II.6.1 ) .
For the year as a whole , world trade volume grew at 4.6 per cent , up from 1.5 per cent in the preceding year .
The recovery of world trade in 2017 was driven equally by AEs and EMEs .
A fuller response to the rising tide of world trade was , however , restrained by supply-side bottlenecks relating to liquidity , documentation and delays in refunds following the implementation of the GST ( Box II.6.1 ) .
Since 2012-13 , structural shifts in India ' s export profile have been underway .
The implementation and refund delays under the new tax regime of Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) had reportedly led to working capital constraints for firms .
In the absence of high frequency data , it is difficult to test this hypothesis using general economic activity indicators .
In order to overcome this handicap , we looked at exports data as it is available at monthly frequency .
More precisely , we check whether working capital to sales ratio for sector i helps explain the sectoral variation in the following double difference :
If the GST implementation led to an export deterioration in October 2017 due to the mechanism espoused above , then we should expect a negative correlation between the above double difference and working capital to sales ratio .
We run the following regression to test the validity of these hypotheses :
The coefficient on Dummy ( Sep ' 17 ) is insignificant , showing no direct impact of GST , though β , is significant in column 2 and shows a small but positive impact on short-term borrowings , i.e. , firms in sector with high working capital requirements increased their short-term borrowing in September 2017 .
This suggests that the response of India ' s export to global growth has been limited .
Third , even as some peer economies have managed to build their market shares in key items of India ' s export basket , India ' s exports have faced erosion in terms of market presence .
We also find that in Q3 2017 , firms reduced their ' cash and bank balance ' during this period as reflected in β , coefficient in column 4 .
Lastly , the quarter dummies are negative though insignificant in the case of capital expenditure as shown in columns 5 and 6 , which suggests that capital expenditure was not affected in this period .
Given these results , we can conclude that firms primarily ran down their cash and bank balance during Q3 2017 in response to the GST shock to their short-term funding .
They were mainly supported by higher international prices as unit value realisations rose by 18.5 per cent , outstripping volume growth of 1.5 per cent during 2017-18 .
Among non-oil exports , engineering exports - mainly led by iron and steel , non-ferrous metals and automobiles - went up across the board to destinations in the European Union ( EU ) , North America , Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) , Middle East and North Africa .
For instance , an increase in export growth relative to its past performance or relative to that of a competitor economy may arise not just because of improvement in competitiveness ( price / cost competitiveness ) but due to an advantageous mix of export markets and export products .
This aggregate measure , however , does not reveal anything about the source of the improvement .
The RCA metric analyses the relative trade performance of individual countries in particular commodities .
The RCA is computed as the ratio of a commodity ' s share in a country ' s exports relative to the share of the commodity in total world exports ( equation 1 ) .
The trade pattern of a commodity is assumed to reflect inter-country differences in relative costs as well as in non-price factors , " revealing " the comparative advantage of the trading countries .
A country is said to have comparative advantage in a particular sector if the RCA for that sector is greater than 1 .
An analysis of the RCA of the top five exports from India reveals a mixed trend .
Nonetheless , India has been able to protect its relative advantage in the top five export sectors ( mineral products , textiles , chemicals , base metals and pearls & precious stones ) .
Although RCA is a widely accepted approach for assessing comparative advantage , it does not account for import trade flows , relative prices of commodities , supply and demand shocks and does not provide insights into the drivers of comparative advantage .
As indicated earlier , change in a country ' s market share could be driven by push factors ( country-specific factors ) or by shifts in the product mix or export market .
Thus , the shifts in a country ' s market share need to be decomposed into different segments to fully comprehend the underlying dynamics .
In this context , export growth can be decomposed in a weighted analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) framework using disaggregated bilateral trade data ( Gaulier et al . , 2013 ) .
The analysis reveals that between 2006 and 2016 , India gained market share relative to many of its peers ( Chart 2a ) .
The contribution of push factors , shown in the chart as push-effect , was relatively strong in increasing India ' s export market share during 2006- 2010 though it has been negative or largely muted since 2010 ( Chart 2b ) .
Similarly , changes in product mix have generally had a negative contribution to export market share since 2010 .
Yet another measure of international competitiveness is the Real Effective Exchange Rate ( REER ) .
The rise in the REER in the case of India is lower than for many peer economies ( Chart 3 ) .
Helped by the rise in international steel prices and subdued supply from China , India turned net exporter of steel for the second consecutive year and accounted for about 2 per cent of global exports in the category .
Spurred by rising demand for frozen shrimp and a drastic reduction in rejection rates by EU countries brought about by quality enhancing measures in India , marine exports increased .
The top markets that absorbed half of the increase in India ' s exports in 2017-18 included the USA , China , Hong Kong , Germany , Bangladesh and Vietnam .
By contrast , exports to the United Arab Emirates , the third largest export destination , declined due to lower shipments of gems & jewellery and readymade garments , which shrank the bilateral trade surplus from a year ago ( Chart II.6.2 ) .
Merchandise - imports , had spiralled down into a prolonged decline starting in December 2014 , broke out of the contraction in October 2016 and rose sharply in 2017-18 peaking in April 2017 before losing some steam in ensuing months .
A decomposition of these patterns through the upturn phase ( October 2016 to March 2018 ) shows that the price impact dominated the volume effect during November 2016 - March 2017 , coinciding with the sharp increase in international crude oil prices .
The volume impact eclipsed the price impact during April 2017 to February 2018 .
The burgeoning import bill for petroleum crude and products largely reflected higher international crude oil prices as import volumes have broadly remained stable .
International crude oil prices firmed up in response to production cuts imposed by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) and Russia , and supply shocks emanating from Venezuela which reduced global output by about 0.7 million barrels per day in 2017 .
These cuts are intended to remain in place till December 2018 .
Meanwhile , the rise in crude prices incentivised a ramping up of shale production in the US to record levels in 2017 , augmenting global supply by 0.7 million barrels per day .
Notwithstanding this development , the faster expansion of global demand by 1.7 million barrels per day has necessitated a drawdown of inventories by 0.5 million barrels per day in 2017 in the OECD countries , which drew a line under crude prices .
Gold imports at 955.2 tonnes were due to a rebound in domestic demand for the precious metal as jewellers replenished inventory amidst a turnaround in retail demand after demonetisation in the preceding year .
Petroleum and gold together accounted for more than one-third of import growth in 2017-18 ( Chart II.6.3 ) .
Non-oil non-gold imports accounted for 65.1 per cent of total import growth on a weighted contribution basis as a part of domestic demand spilled into imports ( Box II.6.3 ) .
Electronic goods , pearls and precious stones , coal , chemicals , machinery and iron and steel together contributed more than half of the growth in this segment ( Chart II.6.4 ) .
Responding to unusually high imports of electronic goods , the government raised the basic customs duty for various electronic products like mobile phones including its parts and accessories , smart watches , and parts of televisions .
Domestic shortages of coal caused by lower production than the target set for Coal India Ltd .
Korea , China and Japan were important sources of iron and steel imports .
This has given rise to concerns that disruptions in the production / supply chain during post-demonetisation have forced domestic demand to spill over into imports in order to overcome domestic supply constraints .
This phenomenon of reverse import substitution could reduce GDP in India through leakages of domestic demand into external markets .
In order to investigate the above phenomenon and attempt to identify its underlying drivers , items common between the index of industrial production ( IIP ) and merchandise imports were identified at the 4-digit level of the national industrial classification ( NIC ) , 2008 .
As a first step , growth rates for these common items were compared , and it was observed that import growth ' ® far exceeded IIP growth during mid-2014 to late 2015 and again from mid-2016 ( Chart 1a and 1b ) .
If I , increases , it indicates that imports are substituting for domestic production .
The other dummy variable Dummy , takes value of 1 from October 2017 to May 2018 , invigorates possible state of supply chain in post GST period .
non-food manufacturing component of the wholesale price index ( WPI ) controls for domestic price conditions - if domestic prices are benign , they will discourage imports .
The significance of Dummy indicates that there is a structural upward shift in the recourse to imports during the period post demonetisation , pointing to a regime change in which reliance on imported inputs increased significantly .
On the other hand , the dummy for post GST period , exhibit negative significant coefficient indicating gradual normalisation in imports .
Exchange rate changes work to deter import intensity , as expected , but only at the margin , as evident in the relatively small size of the coefficient on the exchange rate term .
Domestic inflation works in tandem with the exchange rate - if inflation in India goes up , it incentivises recourse to cheaper imports .
In summary , import intensity of industrial raw materials used in manufacturing is influenced by domestic demand and cost conditions , whereas exchange rate depreciation plays a dampening role .
The fact , however , that the dummy is significant from November 2016 up to September 2017 followed by reversal of sign of dummy in subsequent period , suggests that reverse import substitution effects was at best transient and ebbed gradually as industrial activity in India emerged out of its sluggish phase and regained its momentum .
The dummy variable has been altered to take into account different end points starting from June to September 2017 to validate the robustness of the results .
Net invisibles - comprising net earnings from export of services , remittances and the net outgo of income payments ( profits , dividends and interest payments ) - recorded a double-digit growth in 2017-18 .
With a sizeable expansion in the merchandise trade gap , however , net invisibles could finance only 70 per cent of the merchandise trade deficit as compared with 87 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year .
Among the major categories of services , export of travel services increased on the back of a significant jump in tourist arrivals during 2017-18 and increased per capita earnings from a year ago .
Despite a challenging global business environment in the IT sector , India ' s software exports improved modestly , drawing support from a broad-based demand across industry verticals .
Gradual diversification into advanced technological segments and moving up the value chain in IT supplemented the recovery process for major companies .
Inbound remittances by Indians working overseas - which were held back by lower international crude oil prices in the preceding year - recovered sharply in 2017-18 as income conditions in both AEs and the Gulf region improved .
According to the World Bank ( 2018 ) , global remittances are expected to be driven by a relatively stronger growth in the EU , Russian Federation and the US .
During 2017-18 , the CAD expanded to 1.9 per cent of GDP from 0.6 per cent a year ago , which remained far lower than the peak of 4.8 per cent attained in 2012-13 .
Furthermore , the CAD remained well within the norm of viability / sustainability ( Chart II.6.6 ) .
Net investment inflows of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and foreign portfolio investment ( FPl ) together amounting to US $ 52.4 billion and accounting for 57 per cent of net capital inflows , played a large role in external financing ( Chart II.6.7 ) .
This was despite the phased implementation of an amended double taxation avoidance agreement with these countries effective from April 2017 to prevent evasion of taxes on income and capital gains .
With the ongoing policy reforms in sectors ranging from single brand retail trading , civil aviation , real estate broking service and simplification of legal and regulatory system , India moved into the top 100 countries in the World Bank ' s Ease of Doing Business global rankings .
According to the UNCTAD ' s Investment Trends Monitor ( 2018 ) , India was the 10 " " largest recipient of global FDI in 2017 and remained the topmost destination for greenfield capital investment - even ahead of China and the US , if reckoned on an approval basis ( FDI market intelligence 2017 ) .
There was a substantial increase in FPI flows in 2017-18 from the preceding year , mainly driven by higher flows into the debt segment .
FPI inflows in the debt segment were broadly resilient to risk-off effects of three Fed fund rate hikes in 2017-18 .
There were sell-offs around the world and in India in February and March though , as markets recalibrated expectations about the pace of normalisation of the US monetary policy .
A sharp increase in net inflows of short- term trade credit financed growing imports .
In 2017-18 , net inflows in the form of trade credit amounted to US $ 13.9 billion as compared with US $ 6.5 billion in 2016-17 .
Major imports with recourse to trade credit during the year included oil , gold and coal , which together accounted for nearly one-third of the total trade credit .
Although external commercial borrowings ( ECBs ) raised by domestic entities increased sharply , there were net outflows due to higher repayments .
The Reserve Bank brought in restrictions on issuance of Masala bonds ( rupee- denominated bonds issued abroad ) by raising the minimum maturity period for issuances over and above US $ 50 million to five years and for those below US $ 50 million to three years .
Net flows under non-resident deposit accounts witnessed a turnaround during the year despite a sharp moderation of deposits under Non-Resident ( External ) Rupee ( NRE ) accounts and Non-Resident Ordinary ( NRO ) accounts .
This was essentially due to positive accretions of Foreign Currency Non-Resident ( FCNR ) ( B ) accounts as against a net outflow in the preceding year .
The fall in deposits under NRE and NRO could be due to strengthening of the rupee during the year .
At end-March 2018 , India ' s external debt expanded by US $ 58.4 billion from its level at end-March 2017 .
The rise was primarily due to an increase in portfolio investment in debt securities embedded in commercial borrowings , NRI deposits and short-term debt .
Of the total external debt , 49.5 per cent was denominated in the US dollar , followed by the Indian rupee ( 35.8 per cent ) , the SDR ( 6.5 per cent ) , the Japanese Yen ( 4.8 per cent ) , the Euro ( 3.4 per cent ) and others ( 1.0 per cent ) .
Notably , accretion to the external debt stock was modest and the average interest payments relative to external debt remained flat .
The external debt-to-GDP ratio was the second lowest among the major EMEs , if compared with the 2016 level of external debt positions .
The movement in India ' s external vulnerability indicators between end-March 2017 and end-March 2018 was somewhat mixed ( Table 11.6.1 ) .
The ratio of external debt to GDP increased marginally with the maturity profile of external debt tilted towards a shorter duration on both original and residual maturity bases .
India ' s foreign exchange reserves at end-March 2018 were more than adequate to meet short- term debt liabilities ; nonetheless , these liabilities accounted for a larger share of foreign exchange reserves at end-March 2018 relative to March 2017 .
As a result , India ' s net foreign liabilities ( i.e. , net IIP ) rose modestly and in terms of ratio to GDP , there has been a marginal decline at end-March 2018 over end- March 2017 .
The modest increase in net external liabilities is essentially a reflection of a modest and sustainable CAD .
Even though software exports could successfully withstand the challenging global business environment in the IT sector in 2017-18 , further tightening of visa procedures in the US , the rise of automation and artificial intelligence , and competition from other markets including China can potentially impact export earnings .
Following a reduction in the policy rate by 25 basis points ( bps ) in August 2017 , the policy rate was kept on hold until June 2018 when tt was roused by 25 bps .
The policy stance remained neutral from February 2017 onwards .
The conduct of monetary policy in 2017-18 continued to be guided by the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index ( CPI ) inflation of 4 per cent within a tolerance band of + / - 2 per cent , while supporting growth .
Although fluctuations in food prices imparted considerable intra-year volatility to headline inflation , it remained within the target , averaging 3.6 per cent for the year as a whole .
Growth-inflation trade-offs accentuated during the course of the year , which was reflected in the voting pattern of members of the Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) .
Agenda for 2017-18 : Implementation Status ll.2 In the first bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2017-18 ( April 6 , 2017 ) , the MPC unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.25 per cent .
Inflation was projected to average 4.5 per cent in the first half of 2017-18 and 5 per cent in the second half , with risks evenly balanced around this baseline trajectory .
Growth was projected to strengthen in 2017-18 on the back of the fast pace of remonetisation , favourable capital expenditure stimulating proposals in the Union Budget and the upsurge in activity in the primary capital market .
With underlying inflation pressures persisting , however , and the output gap gradually closing , the MPC stressed that aggregate demand pressures could build up , with implications for the inflation trajectory .
The MPC observed that the transitory effects of demonetisation had lingered on in price formations relating to salient food items , entangled with excess supply conditions with respect to fruits and vegetables , pulses and cereals .
At the same time , the effects of demonetisation on the broader economy were seen as sector-specific and transient .
The MPC noted that in such an uncertain environment , premature action risked disruptive policy reversals later and the loss of credibility .
In the run-up to the third bi-monthly plunged to its lowest reading ( in the series with base 2012 ) in the print for June 2017 .
The MPC observed that even as inflation had fallen to a historic low , a conclusive segregation of transitory and structural factors driving disinflation was still elusive .
These developments , along with the possibility of fiscal slippages , called for a careful management of risks to inflation .
The MPC acknowledged the likelihood of the output gap widening , but indicated that it required more data to better ascertain the transient versus sustained headwinds in the growth prints .
Accordingly , the MPC decided to keep the stance neutral and the policy rate unchanged with a majority of 5 votes ; one member voted for a reduction in the policy repo rate by at least 25 bps .
Retail inflation recorded a seven-month high reading in October , driven by a sharp uptick in momentum .
The MPC reiterated its commitment to keeping headline inflation close to the target on a durable basis .
Food prices and fuel inflation also rose abruptly in November before reverting partly in December .
Households ' inflation expectations rose in December and remained elevated , while firms reported input price pressures and increase in selling prices .
In this backdrop , the sixth bi- inflation to remain elevated in H1 of 2018-19 , before softening in H2 under the assumption of a normal monsoon and effective food supply management .
On the one hand , several factors could impinge on the inflation outlook : staggered impact of HRA increases by state governments ; pick-up in global growth that could harden crude oil and other commodity prices ; the revised guidelines on minimum support prices ( MSPs ) for kharif crops ; increase in customs duty on anumber of items ; and fiscal slippage as indicated in the Union Budget .
On the other , subdued capacity utilisation , the possibility of oil prices softening from prevailing levels based on production responses , and moderate rural real wage growth provided some comfort to the inflation outlook .
The MPC noted that there was a need for vigilance around the evolving inflation scenario and voted to keep the policy repo rate on hold while continuing with the neutral stance .
One MPC member , however , voted for an increase in policy repo rate by 25 bps .
At the time of the MPC ' s June 6 , 2018 meeting , headline inflation had edged up driven mainly by inflation excluding food and fuel , suggesting hardening of underlying inflationary pressures .
Inflation projection for H2 of 2018-19 was revised upward to 4.7 per cent vis-a-vis 4.4 per cent inthe April statement .
The MPC noted that a major upside risk to the baseline inflation path had materialised in the form of a sharp increase in crude oil prices that was seen to be durable .
The MPC also flagged risks to inflation from global financial market developments , the significant rise in households ' inflation expectations , the staggered impact of HRA revisions by various state governments , and the revision in the MSP formula for kharif crops ; the forecast of a normal monsoon which was expected to keep food inflation benign .
Taking these into consideration , the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 25 bps , while keeping the stance neutral and reiterating its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis .
The operating framework of monetary policy aims at aligning the operating target - the weighted average call rate ( WACR ) -with the policy repo rate through proactive liquidity management consistent with the stance of monetary policy .
First , given the large liquidity overhang consequent upon demonetisation , - liquidity management operations during 2017-18 were principally aimed at modulating system liquidity from a surplus mode to a position closer to neutrality , consistent with the stance of monetary policy .
Anticipating that surplus liquidity conditions may persist through 2017-18 , both on account of liquidity overhang and higher capital inflows , the Reserve Bank provided forward guidance on liquidity in April 2017 when it indicated it would conduct : ( i ) variable rate reverse repo auctions with a preference for longer term tenors to absorb the remaining post-demonetisation liquidity surplus ; ( ii ) issuances of Treasury Bills ( T-Bills ) and dated securities under the market stabilisation scheme ( MSS ) to modulate liquidity from other sources ; ( iii ) issuances of cash management bills ( CMBs ) of appropriate tenors in accordance with the memorandum of understanding ( MoU ) with the Government of India ( Gol ) to manage enduring surpluses due to government operations ; ( iv ) open market operations ( OMOs ) to manage durable liquidity with a view to moving system level liquidity to neutrality ; and ( v ) fine-tuning variable rate reverse repo / repo operations to modulate day-to-day liquidity .
Second , in consonance with the recommendation of the Expert Committee to Revise and Strengthen the Monetary Policy Framework ( Chairman : Dr. Urjit R. Patel ) , the width of the policy rate corridor was narrowed from 100 bps in April 2016 to 50 bps in April 2017 in a symmetric manner .
Nonetheless , easy liquidity conditions were reflected in the WACR trending below the policy repo rate throughout the year except towards the year-end ( Chart Ill.1 ) .
This trend continued in Q1 of 2018-19 till the WACR firmed up towards the repo rate .
As liquidity absorption under the LAF moderated during the course of the year , the average spread between the WACR and the policy repo rate narrowed from ( - ) 32 bps in April 2017 to a mere ( - ) 5 bps by March 2018 ( Chart III.2 ) .
At the end of June 2018 , the spread , however , widened to ( - ) 12 bps reflecting easing of liquidity conditions since April .
In Q1 of 2017-18 , expansion in currency in circulation due to rapid remonetisation drained about ₹ 2 trillion of surplus liquidity from the by front-loaded expenditure by the government and large redemption of government securities .
To mop up the resulting surplus liquidity and consistent with its objective of moving towards liquidity neutrality , the Reserve Bank auctioned T-Bills ( tenors ranging from 312 days to 329 days ) aggregating 21 trillion under MSS in April and May 2017 .
The average daily net absorption of liquidity increased to ₹ 4.6 trillion ( including reverse repo , MSS and CMBs ) during Q1 of 2017-18 from ₹ 3.1 trillion at end-March 2017 ( Chart III.3 ) .
During Q2 of 2017-18 , frequent recourse to ways and means advances ( WMAs ) and overdrafts ( ODs ) by the government augmented market liquidity even as currency in circulation absorbed up to ₹ 571 billion from the system .
With the government ' s cash balance position improving during August , the average daily net absorption of liquidity declined from ₹ 5.1 trillion ( including LAF , MSS and CMBs ) in the first week of August to ₹ 4.4 trillion by end-August 2017 .
Moreover , the Reserve Bank conducted open market sales consequent on forex intervention purchases to absorb ₹ 600 billion of durable liquidity ( ₹ 200 billion each in July , August and September ) in addition to variable rate reverse repo auctions of various tenors .
In Q3 of the year , average daily net liquidity absorbed under the LAF ( mainly through variable rate reverse repo auctions of tenors ranging from overnight to 28 days ) declined from ₹ 1.4 trillion in October 2017 to ₹ 718 billion in November , aided by the increase in currency in circulation and pick-up in credit growth .
Moreover , the Reserve Bank conducted open market sales on three occasions to absorb ₹ 300 billion on a durable basis ( ₹ 200 billion in October and ₹ 100 billion in November ) in order to mitigate the liquidity impact of forex purchases during the quarter .
Liquidity conditions temporarily turned into deficit mode in the second half of December with the slowdown in government spending prolonging the shortfall created by the usual advance tax outflows .
Accordingly , liquidity amounting to ₹ 1.3 trillion was injected by the Reserve Bank through variable rate repos of varying tenors in addition to regular 14-day term repos .
During Q4 , surplus liquidity declined and turned into deficit towards the year-end .
The average daily net liquidity absorbed under LAF ( including MSF ) amounted to ₹ 353 billion in January .
The liquidity situation , however , turned into deficit in February-March on account of the drying up of government spending and large tax collections , which necessitated average daily net injection of liquidity amounting to ₹ 140 billion by the Reserve Bank .
Anticipating tightness in liquidity conditions in March and with a view to providing greater flexibility to the banking system to tide over the usual year-end liquidity mismatches , four additional variable rate repo operations ( ₹ 250 billion each ) of longer tenors ( 24 to 31 days ) were conducted and standalone Primary Dealers were allowed to participate within the usual notified amount of the regular term repo auction liquidity was augmented in March through redemption of T-Bills , which were issued under the MSS in April and May 2017 .
On the whole , average daily net liquidity absorbed under the LAF ( including MSF ) declined from ₹ 812 billion in Q3 to ₹ 30 billion in Q4 .
During Q1 of 2018-19 , liquidity conditions generally remained in surplus mode , although it moderated during the quarter from an average daily surplus ( under LAF ) of ₹ 496 billion in April to ₹ 140 billion in June .
The surplus liquidity mainly reflected the drawdown of government balances due to transfer of GST proceeds to states in April and higher budgetary spending by the Gol , especially in June 2018 .
In order to manage the surplus liquidity , the Reserve Bank conducted variable rate reverse repo auctions of various tenors while CMBs were again issued in June to address temporary mismatches in government balances .
On the other hand , the Reserve Bank conducted variable rate repos of other tenors in addition to the regular 14-day term repos in June to tide over temporary tightness in systemic liquidity on account of advance tax outflows .
During the quarter , the Reserve Bank also injected ₹ 200 billion through OMO purchases of ₹ 100 billion each in May and June .
Overall , average daily net liquidity absorption under LAF during the quarter amounted to ₹ 258 billion .
The Reserve Bank has been conducting OMOs to manage the enduring liquidity impact of The Reserve Bank has been conducting forex interventions .
Such sterilisation operations can , however , have their own interactions with other aspects of the economy and markets ( Box III.1 ) .
From the perspective of a central bank balance sheet , domestic liquidity conditions are mainly driven by autonomous factors , viz . , currency in circulation , government cash balances and foreign exchange flows .
Cross-country evidence suggests that the extent of sterilisation operations conducted by emerging market economies has increased significantly , commensurate with the magnitude of such flows ( Aizenman and Glick , 2008 ) .
Despite this , expansion in primary liquidity ( reserve money ) was kept in sync with the needs of the growing economy largely through sterilised interventions ( Chart 1.b ) .
Sterilisation operations , if undertaken through sale of domestic securities , can put upward pressure on domestic interest rates which , in turn , can widen interest rate differentials .
In such a scenario , sterilisation operations can trigger higher capital inflows .
Thus , the change in net domestic assets ( NDA ) can be nullified through a change in net foreign assets ( NFA ) .
The sterilisation coefficient measures the extent to which the NDA of a central bank change in response to a change in NFA , while the offset coefficient measures the extent to which a decrease / increase in NDA causes an increase / decrease in NFA .
A value of -1 for the sterilisation coefficient suggests complete sterilisation , i.e. , no impact of capital flows on the reserve money , a value of 0 would imply that forex intervention is not sterilised at all by the central bank .
A value of -1 for offset coefficient suggests the complete ineffectiveness of the central bank in sterilising capital flows , i.e. , complete attenuation of monetary control .
An offset coefficient value of -1 can also be an indication of perfect capital mobility , while a value of 0 would imply no capital mobility .
To assess the effectiveness of sterilisation operations in the Indian context , the sterilisation coefficient is estimated through a modified money demand function , while the offset coefficient is estimated from a modified equation on capital flows for the period July 1997 to October 2017 using monthly second equation for NDA .
Recognising the endogeneity problem between NDA and NFA in both equations , relevant instrumental variables are used in estimation , i.e. , REER and IF in the first equation for NFA , and DS and GS in the second equation for NDA .
Banks passed a large part of the reduction in their cost of funding due to increase in the share of low cost current account and savings account ( CASA ) deposits to their new borrowers , with interest rates on fresh rupee loans exhibiting a faster decline than that on outstanding loans .
However , the transmission from the policy repo rate to deposit and lending rates on fresh rupee loans slowed down during 2017-18 in comparison with the previous year , mainly due to deceleration in deposit growth and a modest revival in credit demand .
Following the policy rate hike of 25 bps on June 6 , 2018 , the median term deposit rate and 1-year marginal cost of funds based lending rate ( MCLR ) increased by 5 bps and 3 bps , respectively .
The weighted average lending rate ( WALR ) on fresh rupee loans also increased by 8 bps in June .
The pace of the decline in term deposit rates was , however , lower during 2017-18 than in the previous year as the pace of accretion to term deposits decelerated .
Significantly , the WALRs on fresh rupee loans declined more than the decline in term deposit rates during 2017-18 unlike in the previous year for two reasons .
Following the cut in the policy repo rate declined across tenors and bank groups till December 2017 , with the 1-year median MCLR declining by 20 bps .
Bank group-wise , both deposit and lending rates of public sector banks exhibited the largest decline ( Chart III.4 ) .
Monetary transmission is not uniform across sectors due to idiosyncratic factors .
During 2017-18 , lending rates on outstanding loans declined across the sectors in a wide range of 24-123 bps , with the largest decline occurring in the personal credit card segment ( Table III.2 ) .
In line with the aggregates , the transmission of the policy rate to the lending rates on fresh rupee loans for housing and vehicle loan segments slowed down significantly during 2017-18 vis-a-vis a year ago ( Table III.3 ) .
In order to improve transparency in lending rates , the MCLR system was introduced in April 2016 in place of the then prevailing base rate system .
However , transmission during the MCLR regime has not been entirely satisfactory .
In order to examine the various aspects of MCLR and to suggest refinements , an Internal Study Group ( Chairman : Dr. Janak Raj ) was constituted by the Reserve Bank .
The report of the Group was placed in the public domain for feedback in October 2017 .
The Reserve Bank undertook several new initiatives during the year for strengthening credit delivery mechanism and also enhancing financial inclusion .
Some of these measures include revised guidelines on priority sector lending , launch of Certified Credit Counsellors ( CCCs ) Scheme for micro , small and medium enterprises ( MSMEs ) , conduct of survey for assessing the challenges faced by the MSME sector , revamp of Lead Bank Scheme ( LBS ) , implementation of some of the key recommendations of the Committee on Medium-Ierm Path on Financial Inclusion and also innovative approaches for financial literacy .
The work is also underway for the formulation of a National Strategy for Financial Inclusion .
In order to ascertain efficacies , the Reserve Bank would undertake the impact assessments of some of the projects under credit delivery and financial inclusion during 2018-19 .
The Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies of the first bi-monthly monetary policy for 2018-19 , mentioned that a ' one size fits all ' approach for imparting financial education to various target groups is sub-optimal and financial education sought to be delivered to diverse target groups needs to be customised .
The priority sector lending ( PSL ) mechanism seeks to provide an access to credit for those vulnerable sections of the society , who are often deprived of it due to their perceived lack of credit worthiness .
The performance of scheduled commercial banks ( SCBs ) in terms of their achievement on priority sector lending ( PSL ) targets is given in Table IV.1.
The Priority Sector Lending Certificates ( PSLCs ) scheme was introduced in April 2016 as a mechanism to incentivise banks which surpass their targets in lending to different categories under the priority sector .
In a manner similar to carbon credit trading , PSLCs allow market mechanism to drive the PSL by leveraging the comparative strength of different banks .
For instance , a bank with an expertise in lending to small and marginal farmers can exceed targets and derive benefit by selling the over-achieved credit target through PSLCs .
Another bank that is better at lending to small enterprises can buy these certificates while selling PSLCs for micro- enterprise loans .
The Reserve Bank has provided the banks with a platform to trade the certificates through its core banking solution portal ( e-Kuber ) .
The PSLC platform saw active participation from all the eligible entities including Urban Co- operative Banks ( UCBs ) and Small Finance Banks ( SFBs ) during 2017-18 .
As at end-March 2018 , total trading volume of PSLCs was ₹ 1843.3 billion as against of ₹ 498.0 billion at end-March 2017 .
Among the four PSLC categories , the highest trading was observed in the case of PSLC- general and PSLC-small and marginal farmer with the transaction volumes being ₹ 796.72 billion and ₹ 696.22 billion , respectively .
Foreign banks with 20 branches and above were on a five year roadmap ( 2013-18 ) , following which the sub-targets for lending to small and marginal farmers and micro enterprises were to apply after a review in 2017 .
Accordingly , after the review , it was decided to harmonise their priority sector targets with domestic banks and make applicable the sub-target of 8 per cent of adjusted net bank credit ( ANBC ) or credit equivalent amount of off-balance sheet exposure ( CEOBE ) , whichever was higher , for lending to small and marginal farmers and the sub-target of 7.5 per cent of ANBC or CEOBE , whichever was higher , for lending to micro enterprises , effective from 2018-19 .
Based on the stakeholders ' feedback and keeping in view the growing importance of services sector in the economy , it was decided to remove the extant applicable loan limits of ₹ 50 million and ₹ 100 million per borrower to micro / small and medium enterprises ( services ) , respectively , for classification under the priority sector .
Accordingly , all bank loans to MSMEs , engaged in services as defined in terms of equipment investment under the MSME Development ( MSMED ) Act , 2006 , shall qualify under the priority sector without any credit cap .
The Government of India has been fixing the target for agricultural credit every year .
During 2017-18 , the Government set the target of ₹ 10,000 billion for agricultural credit .
As on 124.6 per cent of their target whereas co- operative banks and regional rural banks ( RRBs ) achieved 96.4 per cent and 100.7 per cent , respectively ( Table IV.2 ) .
The Kisan Credit Card ( KCC ) scheme aims to provide an adequate and timely institutional credit to farmers with simplified and flexible procedures .
The scheme is implemented by SCBs , RRBs and co-operative banks .
It comprises both short-term crop loan and term loan components .
The progress on the scheme for the last two years is presented in Table IV.3.
Periodical occurrences of natural calamities take a heavy toll of human lives and also cause wide-spread damage to both properties and standing crops in some parts of the country .
A dedicated portal was developed to capture the data on relief measures extended by banks ( Table IV.4 ) .
The measures taken by the Reserve Bank for facilitating flow of credit to MSMEs and other steps taken by the government over the last few years have resulted in an increase in credit flow to MSEs ( Table IV.5 ) .
As announced in the first bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2016-17 on April 5 , 2016 , a framework for accreditation of credit counsellors was prepared by the Reserve Bank , and provided to the SIDBI which subsequently launched the CCCs scheme in July 2017 .
The SIDBI , acting as a registering authority of CCCs , has issued operational guidelines on the scheme ( details are available at https : / / udyamimitra.in / Home / CCC ) .
The CCCs would also share information with MSMEs on suitable credit instruments available in the market .
The MSME sector has emerged as a highly vibrant and dynamic sector of the Indian economy over the last five decades , weathering several challenges .
This sector has played a crucial role in not only providing large employment opportunities and increasing exports but also in promoting industrialisation of rural and backward areas , thereby reducing regional socio- economic imbalances .
MSMEs are regarded as complementary to large industries , as ancillary units .
In view of the limited availability of data for assessing the challenges being faced in the MSME sector , a comprehensive survey was conducted by the Reserve Bank with feedback from 2,355 MSMEs and 1,790 bank branches across states during January-February 2018 to examine ( a ) whether the flow of credit to MSMEs was conditioned by demand side rather than supply side factors , and ( b ) how effective the various government schemes were in promoting the MSME sector .
Despite being an important issue , there are very few attempts ( e.g. , Eastwood and Kohli 1999 , Kohli 1997 and Nikaido et al . , 2015 ) to understand what determines small firms ' access to formal finance in the context of India .
Based on the Reserve Bank survey data , an attempt is made to determine the major factors which influence the probability of an MSME firm accessing a formal source of finance by deploying a logit model .
The dependent variable takes the value of 1 if one of the most important sources of finance as reported by an MSME firm was formal , and 0 otherwise .
Two sets of independent variables - firm specific and owner specific - are used .
Owner specific variables are age profile , social group , religion , gender and education .
Firm specific factors are age of the firm , activity , number of employees , annual turnover , and size of the firm .
The results of the logit analysis are presented in Table 1 .
The results indicate that if a firm is already in operation for more than 5 years , it is less likely to have formal finance as a major source of financing .
As compared to smaller MSMEs with a turnover of less than ₹ 10 lakh , larger sized firms were found to have higher probabilities of having formal funding as the most important source .
The Reserve Bank continued its efforts towards fulfilling the financial inclusion agenda during the year .
In this direction , several new initiatives were undertaken during 2017-18 .
The LBS was started to ensure economic development of the districts / states by establishing co-ordination between banks and government agencies .
In view of changes that have taken place in the financial sector over the years , the Reserve Bank constituted a Committee of Executive Directors of the Bank to study the efficacy of the scheme and suggest measures for its improvement .
SFBs are required to participate in their respective locations , in various fora under the LBS , i.e. , SLBC , District Consultative Committee ( DCC ) / District Level Review Committee ( DLRC ) and Block Level Bankers ' Committee ( BLBC ) as regular members from 2018-19 and also be part of the credit planning exercise .
Under the LBS , one bank in each district is assigned the leadership role and acts as a consortium leader to coordinate the efforts of the banks in that district , particularly in matters such as branch expansion and credit planning to meet the credit needs of the district .
The assignment of lead bank responsibility to designated banks in every district is done by the Reserve Bank .
The Committee on Medium-Term Path on Financial Path on Financial Inclusion ( Chairman : Deepak Mohanty , Executive Director ) , sought to propel the economy to a medium- term sustainable inclusion path .
Drawing upon the recommendations of the Committee , the Reserve Bank focused on strengthening the mechanism for effective credit delivery to the productive sectors of the economy .
Some of the major recommendations that were implemented during 2017-18 include the following : ( a ) BC registry portal has since been launched to enable domestic SCBs , excluding RRBs , to upload data pertaining to BCs deployed by them .
Subsequently , on stabilisation of the database , facility of using BC tracker for public shall be made available ; ( b ) a basic certification course for BCs has commenced .
The translation of the syllabus into different languages is also under process ; and ( c ) The CCC scheme for MSMEs which could help bridge the information gap , and thereby help banks to make better credit decisions was launched during 2017-18 .
In order to have a planned and structured approach to financial inclusion , banks have been advised to prepare Board-approved Financial Inclusion Plans ( FIPs ) .
These FIPs capture banks ' achievements on parameters such as the number of outlets ( branches and BCs ) , Basic Savings Bank Deposit Accounts ( BSBDAs ) , overdraft facilities availed in those accounts , transactions in Kisan Credit Cards ( KCCs ) and General Credit Card ( GCC ) accounts and transactions through the Business Correspondent-Information and Communication Technology ( BC-ICT ) channel .
The progress made on these parameters as reported by banks as at end-March 2018 is set out in Table IV.6.
The Reserve Bank has taken several steps to provide banking facilities in the unbanked villages in the country .
The use of information technology ( IT ) and intermediaries has made it possible to increase outreach , scale and depth of banking services at affordable cost .
The guidelines on Branch Authorisation Policy mandate banks to open at least 25 per cent of the total number of banking outlets opened during a financial year in Unbanked Rural Centres ( URCs ) ( i.e. , tier 5 & tier 6 centres ) .
In order to systematically accelerate the level of financial inclusion in the country in a sustainable manner , the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion document is being finalised under the aegis of the FIAC to take forward the momentum generated by the Reserve Bank ' s financial inclusion policies , the government ' s Jan Dhan programme and the emerging advancements in the field of digital technology .
Apart from an overview of the progress made so far in bringing financial inclusion to the hitherto unserved and underserved sections of the population , the document would also provide a critique on the key issues and challenges that hamper financial inclusion in the country .
Based on a cross-country analysis , the document would provide a vision and mission for ensuring sustainable financial inclusion in the country , through provision of easy to use , affordable and appropriate financial services to the entire population .
Financial literacy is crucial for imparting efficacy to financial inclusion initiatives of the Reserve Bank .
In this direction , a number of new initiatives were undertaken during 2017-18 .
In order to explore innovative and participatory approaches to financial literacy , a block level CFL project was initiated in 2017 by the Reserve Bank across 80 blocks in 9 states .
The project is currently being implemented by 6 NGOs in collaboration with 10 sponsor banks .
Some of the best practices and innovative methods adopted by the NGOs in the execution of the project are highlighted in Box IV.2.
In order to improve the effectiveness of financial literacy camps , FLCs and rural branches Pilot Project on Centres of Financial Literacy ( CFL ) A hub-and-spoke approach to strengthen the financial capabilities of communities has been adopted wherein CFL function as a hub for training and learning , creating trained human resources from communities within the block .
Subsequently , these trained human resources drive outreach in their respective communities as spokes .
NGOs work with low income communities to build their financial capabilities .
The trainers and community financial health workers engage with the community and deliver financial education .
Anganwadi teachers , Asha workers and self-help group leaders who demonstrate good communication skills are recruited from amongst the community .
Peer learning and participatory learning methods are among the key components of the pedagogy .
A mass awareness campaign is initially conducted targeting 100 people in a village .
Education ( NCFE ) supported by the financial sector regulators has prepared audio visuals on the financial awareness messages provided by the Reserve Bank such as ( a ) address proof declaration under KYC norms , ( b ) use of BCs , ( c ) electronic payment systems ( NEFT / RTGS ) , ( d ) not falling prey to fictitious emails / calls and ponzi schemes , ( e ) process of using the unified payment interface through BHIM , and ( f ) various ways of going digital and cashless .
FLCs and rural branches of banks were advised to use the audio-visuals while conducting financial literacy camps .
A mass awareness campaign is initially conducted targeting 100 people in a village . Subsequently , interested participants are divided into batches of 25 and focused 3 day training programmes are conducted for these participants for about 3-4 hours per day .
This reinforcement helps the participants build knowledge and skill to choose appropriate financial products and services .
As a first step , influencers , viz . , members of SHGs , farmers federations , panchayati raj institutions and health workers are identified and named as " Change Agents - CAs . "
They are then nurtured and equipped with knowledge , and ways of behaviour change , through a series of multiple and repeated literacy sessions .
A suitably designed digitally equipped vehicle is being utilised to reach out to ensure that both illiterate people and people in far-flung areas are targeted .
The Reserve Bank , in collaboration with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , organised the RBI- OECD high level global symposium on financial education during November 8-9 , 2017 in New discussions and solutions around implementing effective financial literacy policies in a changing financial landscape and focused on financial literacy in the digital age .
Two hundred and forty high-level delegates from 40 countries participated in the two-day event , including officials and experts from the OECD International Network on Financial Education ( OECD / INFE ) , ministries of finance and education , central banks , regulatory and supervisory authorities , international organisations , academia , private sector and NGOs .
In order to create awareness at a large scale on key topics every year , the Reserve Bank had decided to observe one week in a year as ' Financial Literacy Week ' starting from 2017 .
IV.34 Going forward , in order to ascertain efficacies , the Reserve Bank would undertake the following steps on credit delivery and financial inclusion : ( a ) preparation of a framework for credit delivery to tenant farmers ; ( b ) integration of FIP data with ADEPT to enable automated and timely extraction from CBS of banks ; ( c ) impact assessment of pilot CFL project by an independent agency and ( d ) strengthening of BC Model by capacity building of BCs through the " " Train the Trainers " " programme .
During 2017-18 , the Reserve Bank made concerted efforts to strengthen various segments of the financial markets .
The Reserve Bank used a variety of instruments to absorb the persisting surplus liquidity in the system for ensuring better alignment of money market rates with the policy rate in order to achieve efficient transmission of monetary policy signals .
The Reserve Bank operated in both over-the-counter ( OTC ) and exchange traded currency derivatives ( ETCD ) segments to maintain orderly conditions in the forex market .
Further rationalisation of regulations while maintaining a mechanism for effective monitoring of foreign exchange transactions was carried out during the year for facilitating cross-border flow of funds .
V.1 The Reserve Bank has always strived to develop the financial markets for meeting the evolving financing needs of a fast growing economy .
It issued many directions / circulars during 2017-18 for enhancing the operational flexibility of the market participants .
Further , it employed a multitude of liquidity management tools for managing the persistent surplus liquidity condition in the financial system .
It also intervened in both OTC and ETCD segments of the forex market for managing excessive volatility .
Regulations were rationalised during the year , particularly in respect of foreign investment , cross-border mergers and acquisitions , external commercial borrowings ( ECBs ) , acquisition and transfer of immovable property in India while maintaining a robust reporting structure for monitoring these transactions , with a view to facilitating seamless cross-border flow of funds .
The department initiated a number of measures during 2017-18 , aimed at broadening participation in financial markets , both domestic and foreign ; easing access and transaction norms for participants , widening the range of products , improving financial market infrastructure and maintaining market integrity .
Further , the requirement to provide documentary evidence for establishing the exposure was removed .
Furthermore , entities could freely resort to dynamic hedging , following the removal of most restrictions on cancellation and rebooking of hedge contracts .
V.5 In February 2018 , persons resident in India and foreign portfolio investors ( FPls ) were permitted to take positions ( long or short ) , without having to establish existence of underlying exposure , upto a single limit of US $ 100 million equivalent across all currency pairs involving INR , put together , and combined across all exchanges .
Earlier this limit was US $ 15 million per exchange for position in US $ -INR and US $ 5 million equivalent per exchange for position in EUR ( i.e. , euro ) -INR , GBP ( i.e. , Great Britain pound ) -INR and JPY ( i.e. , Japanese yen ) - INR pairs , all put together .
V.6 The Reserve Bank allowed FPIs on November 16 , 2017 to settle OTC -sec transactions either on a T + 1 or T + 2 basis .
This measure would enable easing of market pressure on days of short squeeze .
V.7 With a view to improving liquidity in the G-sec market and to address short squeeze , notional short sales were permitted in November 2017 , allowing market participants not to compulsorily borrow securities in repo market .
In exceptional situations of market stress , entities undertaking notional short sale are permitted to deliver securities from their own held to maturity ( HTM ) / available for sale ( AFS ) / held for trading ( HFT ) portfolios .
V.8 To facilitate further development of Interest Rate Futures ( IRF ) market , a separate limit of ₹ 50 billion for FPls to take long position in IRF was introduced in March 2018 .
The existing limits prescribed for investment by FPls in G-sec ( currently ₹ 2,860 billion ) will be exclusively available for investment in G-sec .
V.9 The Financial Benchmarks India Private Limited ( FBIL ) , an independent financial benchmark administrator , introduced five new benchmarks , viz . , Treasury Bill ( T-Bill ) rates , Certificates Deposit ( CD ) curve , Market Repo Overnight Rate ( MROR ) , Mumbai Inter-bank Forward Offer Rate ( MIFOR ) and Mumbai Inter- bank Overnight Indexed Swaps ( MIOIS ) rates during the year , with the approval of the Reserve Bank .
As advised by the Reserve Bank , FBIL has started publication of both central government securities and state development loans ( SDL ) valuation benchmarks with effect from March 31 , 2018 .
V.10 Draft comprehensive repo directions were issued in March 2018 for simplifying , harmonising and streamlining the existing repo guidelines .
After receiving comments from the market participants and other stakeholders , final guidelines will be issued in this regard .
V.11 Rupee interest rate options ( IROs ) were introduced in December 2016 .
Initially , only plain vanilla IROs were allowed but , in June 2018 , directions on rupee interest rate options were reviewed resulting in the introduction of rupee interest rate swaptions .
V.12 Draft guidelines on the framework of electronic trading platform for financial instruments , regulated by the Reserve Bank , were issued in October 2017 for public comments / suggestions .
The objective of this framework is to improve transparency , reduce transaction time and cost , facilitate efficient audit trails , improve risk controls and enhance market monitoring in the financial markets regulated by the Reserve Bank .
Based on the evaluation of the feedback , final guidelines will be issued .
V.13 To enhance participation in the G-Sec market , it is proposed to widen the eligible participants ' base and relax the position limits in the short sale and ' when issued ' segment of the G-Sec market , as announced in the statement on developmental and regulatory policies of June 06 , 2018 .
V.14 The regulatory regime for FPls ' debt investments was reviewed during the year to provide FPls greater latitude in managing their portfolios in terms of increased investment limits , eligible instruments , tenor and duration management , etc .
The limits for FPI investment in debts have been linked to the outstanding stock - 5.5 per cent for central government securities , 2 per cent for SDLs and 9 per cent for corporate bonds for 2018-19 .
Investment in corporate bonds has been rationalised by discontinuing its various sub-categories and prescribing a single limit for FPI investment in all types of corporate bonds .
The cap on aggregate FPI investments in any central government security has been revised upward from 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the outstanding stock of that security .
The minimum residual maturity requirement of three years for investment in debt has been withdrawn , subject to certain conditions .
Other macro-prudential measures put in place include : concentration limits for FPI investment as a percentage of overall investment limit in each debt category , short-term investment limits , and single as well as group investor-wise limit in corporate bonds .
V.15 The department would endeavour to develop derivatives markets in order to promote better risk management by banks and other market players .
It would take steps aimed at rationalising access to foreign currency hedging instruments and simplifying such procedures .
Ensuring the integrity of the financial markets and eradication of market abuse continue to be high on the agenda of the department .
In line with the global best practices , the department plans to frame regulations on market abuse for the markets regulated by the Reserve Bank , as announced in the statement on developmental and regulatory policies of June 06 , 2018 .
V.16 FMOD is entrusted with the responsibility of conducting liquidity management operations for maintaining appropriate level of liquidity in the financial system for monetary transmission .
It also works towards ensuring that orderly conditions are maintained in the forex market through operations in the spot , forward and futures segments .
V.17 Surplus liquidity conditions in the banking system , which resulted from the withdrawal of Specified Banknotes ( SBNs ) in November 2016 , continued during the year .
The department pursued with its efforts to absorb the surplus liquidity with a view to aligning money market rates with the policy rate for more efficient transmission of monetary policy signals .
Various liquidity management tools were used such as fixed / variable rate reverse repos under the liquidity adjustment facility ( LAF ) and outright open market operations ( OMOs ) to mop up the surplus liquidity .
Further , T-Bills issued under the market stabilisation scheme ( MSS ) in April-May 2017 , which matured in March 2018 , served as an additional tool for managing the surfeit of liquidity .
V.18 The extent of surplus liquidity due to SBNs came down by March 2018 on account of the usual year-end fund requirement of banks , including tax payments .
This was managed by multi-tenor variable rate repo operations to the tune of ₹ 1.7 trillion in addition to the regular 14- day variable rate repo operations .
V.19 During the year , the department also adopted new tools to handle situations of excess liquidity .
A securities borrowing and lending arrangement ( SBLA ) scheme was put in place to be used in exceptional circumstances , in case the Bank runs short of securities ( to be used as collateral ) for absorbing excess system liquidity .
Under the SBLA scheme , the Reserve Bank can borrow securities from large institutions to conduct reverse repo operations .
With the recent amendment to the RBI Act , 1934 vide Finance Bill , 2018 , the standing deposit facility ( SDF ) has been made available for adoption .
The SDF would be an unlimited , uncollateralised deposit facility , which once operationalised , would enable the Reserve Bank to absorb unlimited liquidity without any constraint of securities .
V.20 The margin system for LAF / MSF ( i.e. , marginal standing facility ) did not differentiate between the securities on the basis of duration as similar margin requirement was prescribed for securities regardless of their residual maturities .
Therefore , it was decided to align margin requirements for LAF / MSF with residual maturities of the securities from August 01 , 2018 .
The initial margin requirement for central government securities ( including T-Bills ) would be in the range of 0.5 per cent to 4 per cent for five different buckets of residual maturity .
The initial margin requirement in case of SDLs would be in the range of 2.5 per cent to 6.0 per cent for the same maturity buckets .
Further , with a view to incentivising the state governments to obtain public rating for their issuances , it has also been decided that the margin requirement for rated SDLs shall be 1 per cent lower than that of unrated SDLs for the same maturity bucket .
V.21 Orderly conditions were maintained in the forex market during the year through operations in the OTC and ETCD segments .
The liquidity impact was also managed by appropriately timing the OMO operations .
V.22 A new FX Global Code has been formulated by the Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) to strengthen the standards and practices in the global foreign exchange ( FX ) market .
The code was launched on May globally by the Global FX Committee ( GFXC ) in co-ordination with the Local FX Committee ( LFXC ) in each jurisdiction .
The Reserve Bank is a founding member of the GFXC and in India , a LFXC has been set up in coordination with the Foreign Exchange Dealers ' Association of India ( FEDAI ) to take forward the implementation of and adherence to the FX Global Code .
V.23 As announced in the sixth bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2017-18 , the computation and dissemination of the daily reference rate for spot US $ / INR and other major Currencies against the INR , which was being done by the Reserve Bank , has been taken over by Financial Benchmarks India Private Limited .
V.24 The department has taken up a number of research studies on market movements / behaviour over the year , which have helped in shaping both policy and operational framework .
V.25 The department aims to carry out liquidity management operations effectively in line with the stance of monetary policy , by absorbing excess liquidity and supplying durable / temporary liquidity over the year .
The department will continue to closely monitor the evolving liquidity conditions and will modulate the operations to ensure alignment of the weighted average call rate with the policy rate .
It will continue to conduct foreign exchange operations , including interventions , in an effective manner to curb undue volatility in the exchange rate .
The department also proposes to continue policy- oriented research on financial markets .
V.26 FED strives to facilitate trade and payments while enhancing ease of doing business .
New processes and technologies are adopted while continuing with the basic principles for effective monitoring of all cross-border transactions .
In continuation of the mission to streamline the FEMA in alignment with current business and economic scenario , a few more regulations were rationalised during the year .
In the process , there has been greater clarity and consolidation of the regulations .
V.27 A notification ( No . FEMA 20 ( R ) ) dealing with Foreign Direct Investment ( FDI ) , viz . , Foreign Exchange Management ( Transfer or issue of security by a person resident outside India ) Regulations , 2017 was issued on November 7 , 2017 , subsuming 2 original and 91 amendment notifications while keeping the instructions as principle-based as possible .
The highlights of the notification ( including subsequent revisions ) are as follows : ( i ) While simplifying the instructions , the policy on foreign investment was oriented towards facilitating inflow of capital in a move to make the country a favoured destination for foreign investment .
Foreign investment limits for scheduled air transport service / domestic scheduled passenger airline and regional air transport service were increased from 49 per cent to 100 per cent with investment over 49 per cent requiring prior government approval .
In addition , foreign investment up to 49 per cent has been permitted in M / s Air India Ltd . , with the condition that substantial ownership and effective control of M / s Air India Ltd . , shall continue to be vested in Indian nationals .
Foreign investment limit in single brand product retail trading has been increased .
Conversion of a company with foreign investment into a limited liability partnership and vice versa was permitted under the automatic route subject to certain conditions .
FDI and FPI have been defined in line with the recommendations of the Committee on Rationalising the FDI / FIl Definition ( Chairman : Dr. Arvind Mayaram ) .
In addition , the time period for issue of capital instruments has been brought down from 180 days to 60 days to align the same with the Companies Act , 2013 .
A concept of late submission fee for reporting delays has been introduced .
Transfer of shares from non-resident Indians ( NRIs ) / overseas citizens of India ( OCIs ) to persons resident outside India was brought under the automatic route .
In order to enable listed Indian companies to ensure compliance with various foreign investment limits , the Reserve Bank , in consultation with Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) , has put in place a new system for monitoring foreign investment limits .
Necessary infrastructure and systems for operationalising the monitoring mechanism would be made operationalising available by depositories .
Further , following its implementation , all authorised dealer ( AD ) banks would be required to provide the details of investment made by their respective NRI clients to depositories .
Reporting to the Reserve Bank by FPls on stock exchange transactions in the existing system , would continue .
V.28 With a view to promoting ease of doing business , a need was felt to lay down a clear and transparent framework for cross-border mergers , covering merger , amalgamation and arrangement between Indian companies and foreign companies .
Accordingly , regulations have been laid down for granting in-principle approval to all cross-border merger proposals from the FEMA angle as well as other perspectives .
The regulations also prescribe the transactions under FEMA , 1999 , which need to be adhered to consequent to a cross-border merger .
V.29 The status of an NRI and an OCI has been redefined in the regulation on acquisition and transfer of immovable property .
Joint acquisition of immovable property by the spouse of an NRI or an OCI has been permitted .
A person being a citizen of Afghanistan , Bangladesh or Pakistan belonging to minority communities , viz . , Hindus , Sikhs , Jains , Buddhists , Parsis and Christians , who is residing in India and has been granted a long term visa ( LTV ) by the government has been permitted to purchase only one residential immovable property in India as dwelling unit for self-occupation and only one immovable property for self-employment , subject to certain conditions .
The other stipulations pertaining to acquisition , transfer of immovable properties , and repatriation of sales proceeds , have been modified appropriately .
V.30 Rupee denominated bonds ( RDBs ) issued overseas by Indian entities were excluded from the FPI investment limit in corporate bonds .
V.31 As per the statement on developmental and regulatory policies issued along with the fifth bi-monthly monetary policy for 2017-18 , overseas branches / subsidiaries of Indian banks were permitted to refinance ECBs of highly rated ( AAA ) corporates as well as Navratna and Maharatna public sector undertakings , while keeping all other aspects of the ECB policy unchanged : ( i ) outstanding maturity of the original borrowing is not reduced ; and ( ii ) all-in-cost of fresh ECB is lower than the existing ECB .
V.32 The practice of issuance of LoUs / LoCs for trade credits for imports into India by AD category-I banks in favour of overseas supplier , bank or financial institution up to US $ 20 million per import transaction for a maximum period up to one year in case of import of non-capital goods and a maximum period of three years for import of capital goods , was discontinued from March 13 , 2018 .
Towards further rationalisation and liberalisation of the ECB guidelines , a uniform all-in-cost ceiling of 450 basis points ( bps ) over the benchmark rate was stipulated .
The benchmark rate was defined as 6 month US $ LIBOR ( or applicable benchmark for respective currency ) for track I and track II , and prevailing yield of the Government of India securities of corresponding maturity for track III ( Rupee ECBs ) and RDBs .
The ECB liability to equity ratio for ECB raised from direct foreign equity holder under the automatic route was increased to 7 : 1 for the total of all ECBs raised by an entity for amounts exceeding US $ 5 million or equivalent .
The eligibility of raising ECBs was extended to housing finance companies , regulated by the National Housing Bank , port trusts constituted under the Major Port Trusts Act , 1963 or Indian Ports Act , 1908 and to companies engaged in the business of maintenance , repair and overhaul , and freight forwarding .
V.34 With a view to facilitating the customers , the system of outward remittance services was further liberalised by extending the operating framework to non-bank entities , provided the remittances were routed through AD-category I banks and such banks should ensure compliance to KYC / AML ( i.e. , Know your customer / Anti money laundering ) standards prescribed by the Reserve Bank .
V.35 As per the extant practice , transactions under LRS are permitted by AD banks , based on the declaration made by the remitter .
In order to improve monitoring as also to ensure compliance with the LRS limits , a system has been put in place for daily reporting by AD banks of transactions undertaken by individuals under the LRS , which would be accessible to all ADs to ensure verification .
V.36 With a view to having uniformity and consistency of data to enable seamless flow of data as also to reduce documentation , AD category-I banks have been directed to update the Export Data Processing and Monitoring System ( EDPMS ) with data of export proceeds on ' as and when realised basis ' and generate eBRC only from the data available in EDPMS .
Integration of EDPMS with eBRC would make export regularisation simpler and disbursement of duty drawback and incentive process online .
V.37 Following amendments to the Foreign Trade Policy 2015-20 by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade ( DGFT ) , the annual limit for grant of export declaration form ( EDF ) waiver to exporters for export items ( excluding gems and jewellery , articles of gold and precious metals ) on free of cost basis has been revised and reflected in the Master Direction .
Such free of cost supplies would not be entitled to duty drawback or any other export incentive under any export promotion scheme .
Further , export of goods not involving any foreign exchange transaction directly or indirectly will continue to require the waiver of EDF procedure from the Reserve Bank .
V.38 The operational powers delegated to AD banks for ratification of delayed reporting of certain routine overseas direct investment ( ODI ) transactions were extended during the year .
V.39 The department has so far rationalised and consolidated 18 original notifications and 193 amendments in consultation with the government .
The rationalisation of notifications pertaining to regulations on foreign investments in India , and acquisition and transfer of immovable property in India by person resident outside India was the highlight of the year 2017- 18 .
The remaining notifications pertaining to borrowing and lending between residents and non-residents as well as ODI are being finalised in consultation with the government .
V.40 During 2017-18 , the department has transited to a technology-based compilation with greater reliance on technology for collection of information .
The availability and accessibility of almost near time data will enhance operational efficiency and overall functioning of the department .
During 2017-18 , the banking sector continued to grapple with the problems of deteriorating asset quality and declining profitability .
In order to align the resolution process with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code ( IBC ) , 2016 , the framework for resolution of stressed assets was revised and the previous schemes were withdrawn .
Further , given the increasing popularity of digital payments medium , data protection and cyber security norms were strengthened .
Know Your Customer ( KYC ) norms were modulated further to make them more effective .
VI.2 Furthermore , for effective and timely redressal of grievances of customers of NBFCs , an Ombudsman Scheme for deposit taking NBFCs was initiated .
Though implementation of Indian Accounting Standards ( Ind AS ) in case of SCBs has been postponed for one year due to lack of necessary legislative amendments , NBFCs with net worth of ₹ 5 billion and above are required to implement Ind AS from April 1 , 2018 .
In order to bring about ownership-neutral regulations , government-owned NBFCs will now be required to adhere to the Bank ' s prudential regulations in a phased manner .
In order to further harmonise regulatory policies for cooperative banks , the regulatory process for opening current account with the Reserve Bank was simplified for these banks .
Fine-tuning of the regulatory and supervisory policies is expected to further strengthen the resilience and robustness of the banking system .
VI.3 The mandate of FSU is to monitor stability related matters with the objective of strengthening the financial system .
FSU implements this mandate by examining the risks to financial stability , undertaking macro-prudential surveillance through systemic stress tests and other tools as well as disseminating information on status of and challenges to financial stability through the Financial Stability Report ( FSR ) .
It also functions as a secretariat to the Sub-Committee of the Financial Stability and Development Council ( FSDC ) , a co-ordination council of regulators for maintaining financial stability and monitoring macro-prudential regulation in the country .
VI.4 As planned , FSR was published in June 2017 and December 2017 .
With a view to strengthening the stress testing framework , the methodology for estimating sectoral probability of defaults was reinforced further while the methodology for projecting capital to risk- weighted asset ratio ( CRAR ) was revised by estimating risk weighted assets dynamically using the internal ratings based formula .
The results based on these methodologies were published in FSR .
Further , contagion ( network ) analysis was expanded to urban cooperative banks as well .
VI.5 The FSDC Sub-Committee held two meetings in 2017-18 and reviewed various issues including the establishment of National Centre for Financial Education ( NCFE ) , operationalisation of information utilities registered by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India ( IBBI ) , sharing of data among regulators , implementation status of Legal Entity Identifier ( LEI ) , framework for systemically important financial institutions ( SIFls ) , implementation of common stewardship code for the Indian financial sector , single entity undertaking multiple activities and review of Central KYC Registry ( CKYCR ) .
The Sub- Committee also reviewed the status of corporate insolvency resolution process , activities of its various technical groups and the functioning of State Level Coordination Committees ( SLCCs ) in various states / UTs .
The recommendations of the Working Group on FinTech and Digital Banking , Shadow Banking Implementation Group , credit cycles and financial stability , Investor Education and Protection Fund ( IEPF ) , action taken on shell companies , legal framework for cross-border insolvency and issues regarding acceptance of deposits under the Companies Act were the other issues discussed .
VI.7 In the year ahead , FSU will continue to conduct macro-prudential surveillance , publish the FSR and conduct meetings of the FSDC Sub- Committee and IRTG .
In addition , the current stress testing framework / methodology will be strengthened so as to eventually migrate to the stressed scenario-based supervisory capital requirement for banks .
DBR is the nodal department for regulation of SCBs .
Apart from financial stability , it focuses on developing an inclusive and competitive banking structure through appropriate regulatory measures .
The regulatory framework is fine-tuned as per the requirements of the Indian economy while suitably adapting to the international best practices .
VI.9 Banks were directed to advise their existing large corporate borrowers ( i.e. , those having total exposure of ₹ 500 million and above ) to obtain LEI during March 31 , 2018 to December 31 , 2019 .
Banks should encourage large borrowers to obtain LEI for their parent as well as all subsidiaries and associates .
VI.10 The Reserve Bank had to introduce various schemes such as the Strategic Debt Restructuring ( SDR ) scheme , Scheme for Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets ( S4A ) , Corporate Debt Restructuring ( CDR ) scheme and Joint Lenders ' Forum ( JLF ) that aimed at structured resolution of stressed assets as there was no comprehensive insolvency and bankruptcy law in the country then .
In view of the enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code ( IBC ) , 2016 , the need for such specific schemes / guidelines was obviated and consequently , the previous schemes / guidelines such as SDR , S4A , CDR and JLF stood withdrawn from February 12 , 2018 .
On the other hand , when the problem is ignored , economic performance would suffer ; specifically , it has been estimated that the growth foregone due to an overhang of non-performing loans can be in excess of two percentage points annually till the problem is resolved ( Balova et al . , 2016 ) .
On the contrary , a quick and efficient resolution of banking crises prevents the possibility of strong negative economic effects , and the related structural policy reforms might even result in favourable economic effects , as was demonstrated in the Nordic experience ( Steigum 2010 ) .
These were interspersed with incentives for the lenders to adopt the schemes and effect an early resolution .
However , these schemes were generally applied by banks to avail of asset classification benefits , with very little efforts towards resolution of the underlying stress .
It has been argued in the context of the experience of Japan in the 1990s and the OECD countries ( McGowan et al . , 2017 ) in the 2000s that forbearance in lending props up inefficient firms and encourages them not to undertake corrective efforts , thus leading to sustenance of zombie firms in an economy .
The latter study has also documented the adverse effects that prevalence of zombie companies can have on the growth in investment and employment , and ease of entry to young firms and their ability to upscale .
Acharya et al . ( 2016 ) has documented the effects of zombie congestion emanating from the credit misallocation due to windfall gains enjoyed by weakly capitalized banks from the Outright Monetary Transactions ( OMT ) programme of the European Central Bank , on the investment and employment growth of non- zombie firms in the European context .
Breaking the vicious circle of forbearance in lending and perverse adoption of resolution schemes , which feed on each other , requires a strong presence of bankruptcy laws in a country .
The enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code , 2016 ( IBC ) and the amendment to the Banking Regulation Act , 1949 empowering the Reserve Bank to leverage the IBC mechanism for resolving specific stressed accounts , have provided a real opportunity to address the above challenges .
The Reserve Bank has taken certain steps over the last few months in this direction with a focus on certain large value stressed accounts .
The ' revised framework for resolution of stressed assets ' , issued by the Reserve Bank on February 12 , 2018 must be seen as a step towards laying down a steady-state approach for ensuring early resolution of stressed assets in a transparent and time-bound manner so that the maximum value could be realized by the lenders .
The revised framework , while leaving the definition of a non-performing asset unchanged , lays down broad principles that should be followed while undertaking the resolution of stressed assets , with bright line tests for ensuring credible outcomes .
The underlying theme of the revised framework is to provide as much flexibility as possible to the lenders and the stressed borrowers but , at the same time ensure that the resolution plan is implemented within a timeframe and that the resolution plan is credible .
If lenders and the large stressed borrowers are unable to put in place a credible resolution plan within the timelines , they would be required to go through the structured insolvency resolution process under the IBC .
The revised framework also attempts to instil the requisite discipline mechanism for a one-day default in the context of bank loans , akin to the market discipline to which the borrowers raising money through debt markets are subject .
With defaults being reported to a central database , which is accessible to all banks , the credit discipline is expected to improve significantly .
Nevertheless , default in payment is a lagging indicator of financial stress of a borrower and therefore , lenders need to be proactive in credit monitoring to identify financial stress at an early stage rather than wait for a borrower to default .
Early identification of stress would provide sufficient time for lenders to put in place the required resolution plan .
Another major change that has been introduced is that resolution plans can now be implemented individually or jointly by lenders .
Complete discretion and flexibility has been given to the banks to formulate their own ground rules in dealing with the borrowers who have exposures with multiple banks .
Under the revised framework , the lenders can implement differential resolution plans that are tailored to their internal policies and risk appetite .
To ensure that only credible resolution plans are implemented , a framework of independent affirmation has been introduced through the requirement of independent credit opinions on the proposed plan by empaneled credit rating agencies .
Taken as a whole , the revised framework attempts to improve the credit culture in the country and the trust between counterparties in a transaction .
This will be critical in ensuring sufficient incentives for the banks to effectively carry out their role as delegated monitors of loans .

Banks were advised in November 2017 to put in place appropriate mechanisms to extend banking facilities to senior citizens and differently abled persons .
VI.12 The Annual Conference of Banking Ombudsmen , 2014 had suggested that banks and Indian Bankers ' Association ( IBA ) should formulate a policy on zero liability of customers in electronic banking transactions , in cases where the bank was unable to establish customer level negligence .
VI.13 Following an amendment to the guidelines on Liquidity Coverage Ratio ( LCR ) , banks incorporated in India are now permitted to recognise cash reserves held with foreign central banks in excess of the reserve requirements as Level 1 High Quality Liquid Assets ( HQLA ) , in cases where a foreign sovereign has been assigned a zero per cent risk weight by an international rating agency .
In cases where a foreign sovereign has been assigned a non-zero per cent risk weight by an international rating agency , but a zero per cent risk weight has been assigned at national discretion under Basel II framework , reserves held with such foreign central banks in excess of the reserve requirement would be allowed to be treated as Level 1 HQLA , to the extent that these balances cover the bank ' s stressed net cash outflows in that specific currency .
Zero Liability : A customer need not bear any loss if the deficiency is on the part of the bank and in cases where the fault lies neither with the bank nor with the customer but lies elsewhere in the system and the customer notifies the bank within three working days of receiving the communication from the bank about the unauthorised transaction .
Limited Liability : Where the loss is due to customer ' s negligence , the customer has to bear the entire loss until the unauthorised transaction is reported to the bank .
In cases where the fault lies neither with the customer nor with the bank but lies elsewhere in the system and the customer reports the unauthorised transaction with a delay of four to seven working days after receiving the communication about the transaction , the maximum liability of the customer ranges from ₹ 5,000 to ₹ 25,000 , depending on the type of account / instrument .
Liability as per Board approved policy : If the unauthorised transaction is reported beyond seven working days , the customer liability shall be determined as per the bank ' s Board approved policy .
The bank is required to credit ( shadow reversal ) the amount involved in the unauthorised electronic transaction to the customer ' s account within 10 working days from the date of notification by the customer .
The bank has to resolve the complaint and establish the liability of the customer , if any , within 90 days of the receipt of the complaint .
Further , banks have been mandated to require the customers to register their mobile numbers for SMS alerts and for electronic transactions .
The assets allowed as Level 1 HQLA for the purpose of computing LCR of banks include , inter alia , government securities in excess of the minimum SLR requirement and , within the mandatory SLR requirement , government securities to the extent allowed by the Reserve Bank under the Marginal Standing Facility ( MSF ) [ presently 2 per cent of the bank ' s net demand and time liabilities ( NDTL ) ] and under the Facility to Avail Liquidity for Liquidity Coverage Ratio ( FALLCR ) ( this has been increased from 9 per cent to 11 per cent of the bank ' s NDTL ) .
Hence , the total carve-out from SLR available to banks is 13 per cent of their NDTL .
The other prescriptions in respect of LCR remain unchanged .
VI.14 Final guidelines on Net Stable Funding Ratio ( NSFR ) were issued in May 2018 .
VI.15 In February 2018 , exposure of banks and NBFCs to the GST-registered Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises ( MSMEs ) was permitted to be classified as a standard asset , as per a 180-day past due criterion , subject to certain conditions , including a cap of ₹ 250 million on the aggregate exposure .
On a review , the benefits have now been extended to all MSMEs with aggregate credit facilities up to the above limit , including those which are yet to register under the GST ( i.e. , goods and services tax ) .
In view of the benefits from increasing formalisation of the economy for financial stability , the dues payable from January 1 , 2019 onwards shall be aligned to the extant 90 days NPA norm in a phased manner in case of the GST-registered MSMEs .
The MSMEs that are not GST-registered as on December 31 , 2018 shall revert to 90 day NPA norm immediately from January 1 , 2019 .
VI.16 Some credit information companies ( CICs ) were following the practice of offering limited versions of credit information reports ( CIRs ) to credit institutions ( Cls ) based on credit information available in specific modules such as commercial data , consumer data or micro finance institution ( MFI ) data and , as a result , lenders remained unaware of the complete credit history of borrowers available across various modules that affected the quality of their credit decisions .
Further , ClCs were charging differential rates for such specific reports .
CICs were , therefore , directed to ensure that the CIR in respect of a borrower furnished to the Cl , incorporated all the credit information available in all modules in respect of the borrower .
VI.17 Based on the recommendations of the Inter-Departmental Task Force constituted in December 2014 , definitions of 189 data elements reported to the Reserve Bank across multiple banking and regulatory returns were harmonised .
Category II AIFs are mostly real estate funds and PE funds which invest in unlisted securities .
Category III AIFs ( mainly hedge funds ) employ leverage and diverse / risky trading strategies in listed / unlisted derivatives .
Further , with a view to restricting indirect exposure of banks , a ceiling has been prescribed on investment by banks ' subsidiaries in AIFs-III , i.e. , up to the regulatory minima prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) on sponsor / manager commitment ( 5 per cent of the corpus or ₹ 100 million , whichever is less ) .
VI.20 Banks have been advised in September 2017 to ascertain the reputational risk owing to association of name of the bank with AIFs / Infrastructure Debt Funds ( IDFs ) within the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ( ICAAP ) framework and determine the additional capital required , which will be subject to supervisory examination as part of the supervisory review and evaluation process .
VI.21 In September 2017 , the minimum capital requirement for banks ' to invest in financial services companies and other specified investments / activities was increased from CRAR of 10 per cent to the minimum CRAR plus the capital conservation buffer ( CCB ) , thus aligning the minimum CRAR requirement with the CCB requirement under the Basel lll framework .
However , they cannot take proprietary positions in commodity derivatives .
VI.23 As banks ' broking subsidiaries bring a lot of value by their operation in the stock market , especially in enabling retail participation in the capital markets , allowing banks ' broking subsidiaries in commodity derivatives segment would help them reach out to the retail participants and untapped customer segments .
Accordingly , banks ' subsidiaries have been allowed to offer broking services in the commodity derivatives segment of the exchanges subject to not undertaking proprietary positions in this segment .
VI.24 The Reserve Bank had set up an inter- regulatory Working Group on FinTech and Digital Banking to look into the granular aspects of FinTech and its implications so as to review and reorient appropriately the regulatory framework and respond to the dynamics of the rapidly evolving FinTech scenario .
The report of the Working Group was released on February 08 , 2018 for public comments .
A regulatory sandbox refers to live testing of new products or services in a controlled / test regulatory environment .
Regulatory and supervisory authorities may have an active role to play in sandbox arrangements as they may permit certain regulatory / supervisory relaxations to the entities testing their products in the sandbox .
The sandbox could lead to better outcomes for consumers through an increased range of products and services , reduced costs , and improved access to financial services .
The major challenges of the regulatory sandbox are the issues arising out of customer and data protection .
When considering establishing a sandbox , regulators may look into the following key design features : 1 .

In December 2017 , all financial creditors regulated by the Reserve Bank were advised to adhere to the relevant provisions of IBC , 2016 and IBBI ( lUs ) Regulations , 2017 and immediately put in place appropriate systems and procedures to ensure compliance with these provisions .
VI.26 The Reserve Bank , through its public notices , has repeatedly cautioned users , holders and traders of virtual currencies ( VCs ) , including bitcoins , regarding the risks associated with dealing with such currencies .
In view of the associated risks , the Reserve Bank mandated in April 2018 that the entities regulated by it should not deal in VCs or provide services for facilitating any person or entity in dealing with or settling VCs .
Further , regulated entities which already provide such services should exit the relationship within three months .
VI.27 To align with the amendments in the Prevention of Money Laundering ( PML ) Rules by the government , amendments to the Master Direction on KYC have been issued .
Aadhaar Number has been made mandatory ( for those individuals who are eligible to be enrolled for Aadhaar ) along with PAN / Form 60 for all account based relationships .
Enrolment number for Aadhaar is admissible if not older than 6 months ; however , the Aadhaar Number has to be provided within the next 6 months .
Definition of Officially Valid Documents ( OVDs ) has been amended .
With the designation of Aadhaar number and PAN number as mandatory documents , the OVDs are ( i ) passport , ( ii ) driving licence , ( iii ) voter ' s identity card , ( iv ) NREGA job card duly signed by an officer of the state government and ( v ) letter issued by the National Population Register containing details of name and address .
Aadhaar number will have to be authenticated by the reporting entities using e-KYC authentication [ biometric or One Time Password ( OTP ) based ] or yes / no authentication .
VI.28 Where current address is not available in Aadhaar card , an OVD has to be furnished giving the current address .
To address immediate concerns , a time window of 3 months has been provided within which alternate documents like utility bills not older than 2 months , can be temporarily used as a proof of current address .
Further , the process of certification has been codified , requiring comparing of the copy of OVD so produced by the client with the original and recording the same on the copy by the authorised officer of the reporting entity .
VI.29 The Reserve Bank will continue to focus on those action points pertaining to 2017-18 , which remain work-in-progress , viz . , Ind AS implementation , issuance of final guidelines on variation margin requirements , revised framework for securitization and guidelines on corporate governance in line with the evolving Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ( BCBS ) standards .
BCBS has deferred the implementation of the revised market framework to January 1 , 2022 .
Accordingly , the work on minimum capital requirements for market risk will not be pursued during 2018-19 .
VI.30 The Reserve Bank will issue revised prudential regulations , covering instructions on exposure norms , investment norms , risk management framework and select elements of Basel III capital framework to the All India Financial Institutions ( AIFls ) .
VI.31 There are significant differences in the corporate structure permissible to banks for setting up financial services entities , depending upon the timing of their licensing .
It is , therefore , proposed to harmonise these differences under a common set of guidelines .
VI.32 With a view to promoting innovation in financial services , it is proposed to enter into collaborative arrangements with other leading regulators in this area .
VI.33 For the purpose of fostering competition and re-orienting the banking structure in India , the policy on subsidiarisation of foreign banks and the Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate ( MCLR ) guidelines will be reviewed .
VI.34 The regulatory guidelines for regional rural banks ( RRBs ) vis-a-vis SCBs will be reviewed .
VI.35 As cooperative banks play an important role in the Indian financial system , the Reserve Bank has always endeavoured to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework so that they emerge financially strong and have sound governance .
In this context , DCBR , in charge of prudential regulations of cooperative banks , took the following initiatives in 2017-18 .
VI.36 The harmonisation of regulatory policies for all cooperative banks is an ongoing process .
As part of this , the regulatory process for opening of current account with the Reserve Bank has been simplified for all the cooperative banks [ urban cooperative banks ( UCBs ) , state cooperative banks ( StCBs ) and district central cooperative banks ( DCCBs ) ] .
The guidelines on limiting liability of customers on account of unauthorised electronic banking transactions have been extended to all cooperative banks .
The guidelines on lending to priority sector have been harmonised with those of SCBs .
VI.37 On the three unlicensed DCCBs in the state of Jammu & Kashmir , a Memorandum of Understanding ( MoU ) was signed by the state , the Government of India and NABARD .
Accordingly , the state government has released its share of ₹ 2.56 billion in March 2018 and the same is held with the cooperative department of Jammu and Kashmir government for onward transmission to the three DCCBs .
Issue of licences to these three DCCBs will be considered after the funds are transferred to them by the state government .
VI.38 The review of supervisory action framework for urban cooperative banks is under process .
The trigger points for initiating corrective action are being reviewed to help ensure that the weak UCBs are turned around well in time .
This agenda is carried forward to the year 2018-19 .
VI.39 A scheme of financial assistance to UCBs for implementing the core banking solution ( CBS ) was announced on April 13 , 2016 in consultation with the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology ( IDRBT ) and the Indian Financial Technology and Allied Services ( IFTAS ) ( a subsidiary of IDRBT ) .
Under the scheme , the initial set up-cost of ₹ 0.4 million has been paid by the Reserve Bank to IFTAS .
During the year , 3 more UCBs implemented CBS under the scheme , taking the number of CBS-compliant UCBs to 1,453 .
VI.40 A document on functional and technical requirements for CBS in UCBs prepared by IDRBT in consultation with the Reserve Bank was released in July 2017 .
Of these , five were granted permission , including two cases of merger of banks having negative net worth with stronger UCBs .
The remaining proposal , received in June 2018 , is presently under process .
Two mergers took place during the year .
Further , one UCB voluntarily converted itself into a ( non-banking ) cooperative credit society under Section 36A ( 2 ) of the Banking Regulation Act , 1949 .
VI.42 The agenda for 2018-19 includes issuing of licenses to the three unlicensed DCCBs in Jammu and Kashmir in pursuance of the objective that only licensed rural cooperative banks operate in the banking space .
DCBR will reinforce the agenda to ensure that rural cooperative banks are adequately capitalized to meet any challenges and mitigate risks arising due to changes in the banking scenario .
The supervisory action framework for UCBs , framed in 2014 , will be reviewed in order to engage with the concerned banks at an early stage for corrective action .
Implementation of CBS under the scheme of financial assistance to UCBs will continue during the year .
The implementation of some of the recommendations of the High Powered Committee on UCBs ( Chairman : Shri R Gandhi ) is planned during the year .
As recommended by the Committee , in order to improve governance in UCBs , it is proposed that UCBs shall constitute a Board of Management in addition to their elected Board .
Draft guidelines in this regard have been issued for comments / feedback .
A scheme on voluntary transition of eligible UCBs into Small Finance Banks ( SFBs ) as announced in the Second Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement for 2018-19 , will also be issued during the year .
VI.43 NBFCs have evolved as an important alternate source of credit in the Indian economy .
The Department of Non-Banking Regulation ( DNBR ) is entrusted with the responsibility of regulation of NBFCs .
While the online platform itself does not undertake any financial activity , it provides a platform for credit intermediation , bringing together borrowers and lenders .
Regulations have been framed to ensure customer protection , data security and orderly growth .
VI.45 With the objective of bringing the outsourced activities of NBFCs within the regulatory purview as well as ensuring sound and responsive risk management practices by NBFCs , the Reserve Bank issued directions to NBFCs on managing risks arising from outsourcing activities associated with financial services provided by them .
VI.46 ARCs complying with corporate governance practices , have been exempted from the shareholding limit of 26 per cent of post converted equity of the borrower company if the extent of shareholding after the conversion of debt to equity does not exceed the permissible foreign direct investment ( FDI ) limit for the specific sector .
To expand the investor base and to infuse greater depth in the Security Receipt ( SR ) market , the Reserve Bank has notified Alternative Investment Fund category II and III , registered with SEBI as non-institutional investors .
VI.47 Government-NBFCs cater to various social obligations and , in the process , their over- exposure to certain sectors may have adverse financial implications depending upon the scale of operations .
Further , as entities raising public funds , they have high level of interconnectedness with the formal financial sector .
Accordingly , deposit taking and systemically important government-owned NBFCs were advised in 2006 to submit a roadmap for complying with the prudential regulations applicable to other NBFCs .
Although all central government NBFCs and 12 state government NBFCs submitted their road map , their implementation has been disparate .
Hence , it was decided to require government-owned NBFCs vide notification dated May 31 , 2018 to adhere to the Bank ' s prudential regulations , and instructions on acceptance of public deposits , corporate governance , conduct of business regulations and statutory provisions , in a phased manner .
A phase-in period till 2022 has been prescribed to ensure that the withdrawal of exemptions takes place in a non-disruptive manner .
VI.53 The transition of government-NBFCs to the prudential regulations will be closely monitored .
The Reserve Bank has been aligning its policies to the changing dynamics in FinTech sector and has already issued guidelines for two new types of IT based NBFCs , viz . , NBFC- Account Aggregator ( NBFC-AA ) and NBFC-Peer to Peer ( NBFC-P2P ) .
During the year , the Bank will examine applications from companies which propose to conduct NBFC business through virtual modes , without a brick and mortar presence .
VI.55 India ' s bank dominated financial system , DBS , entrusted with the responsibility of supervising SCBs ( excluding RRBs ) , plays a central role in ensuring systemic stability .
DBS also supervises Local Area Banks ( LABs ) , Payments Banks ( PBs ) , Small Finance Banks ( SFBs ) , Credit Information Companies ( CICs ) and All India Financial Institutions ( AIFls ) within the existing statutory and regulatory framework .
VI.56 Risk-Based Supervision ( RBS ) under the Supervisory Programme for Assessment of Risk and Capital ( SPARC ) for banks operating in India has been successfully implemented over five supervisory cycles .
The development of supervisory framework for SFBs and PBs is currently underway .
During the year , the RBS model was subjected to an external validation .
As part of the process for sensitising the top management of banks about SPARC , interactive sessions were conducted for board members and top management of several public and private sector banks during the year .
Focused workshops were also convened for skill enhancement of operational as well as senior / middle level management of these banks .
VI.57 During 2017-18 , supervisory assessments of 76 SCBs , 1 LAB and 2 ClCs were placed before the Board of Financial Supervision ( BFS ) .
VI.58 Thirty five Information technology ( IT ) examinations covering broad spectrum of IT risk and thematic examinations of specific focus areas were carried out during the year to evaluate cyber security readiness of the banking sector .
Mock cyber-drills involving hypothetical scenarios were conducted to evaluate the cyber security incident response preparedness of banks .
The exercise helped banks identify and rectify deficiencies in their incident management capabilities .
The Reserve Bank , in pursuance of a fraud involving Letters of Undertaking ( LoU ) reported by banks , had assessed the operational controls around Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication ( SWIFT ) transactions and advised banks to strengthen the same .
It was observed that the action taken by banks in protecting the systems was not adequate and hence the Reserve Bank reiterated its instructions with clear timelines for implementation by banks .
VI.59 The number of cases on frauds reported by banks were generally hovering at around 4500 in the last 10 years before their increase to 5835 in 2017-18 ( Chart Vl.1a ) .
Similarly , the amount involved in frauds was increasing gradually , followed by a significant increase in 2017-18 to ₹ 410 billion ( Chart VI.1b ) .
Chart VI.1 : Number and Amount Involved in Fraud Cases ( of ₹ lakh and above ) reported by Banks during 2008-18
Within the loan category of frauds , PSBs accounted for a major share ( 87 per cent ) followed by the private sector banks ( 11 per cent ) .
The share of PSBs in frauds relating to ' off-balance sheet items ' such as Letter of Credit ( LCs ) , LoU , and Letter of Acceptance was even higher at 96 per cent .
New private sector banks accounted for more than 20 per cent of the frauds related to ' cash / cheques / clearing ' and ' foreign exchange transactions ' .
New private sector and foreign banks accounted for 36 per cent each of all cyber frauds reported in debit , credit and ATM cards , among others .
Out of the seven classifications of frauds in alignment with the Indian Penal Code , ' cheating and forgery ' was the major component followed by ' misappropriation and criminal breach of trust ' .
In ' cheating and forgery ' cases , the most common modus operandi was multiple mortgage and forged documents .
Mumbai ( Greater Mumbai ) , Kolkata and Delhi were the top three cities in reporting of bank frauds through ' cheating and forgery ' .
In respect of staff involvement in frauds , banks reported that it was prominent in the categories ' cash ' and ' deposits ' , which had a much smaller share in the overall number of fraud incidents and the amount involved .
In a view of large divergences observed in asset classification and provisioning in the credit portfolio of banks as well as the rising incidence of frauds in the Indian banking system , an Expert Committee under the chairmanship of Shri Y.H. malegam , a former member of the Central Board of the Reserve Bank , had been constituted to look into the reasons for high divergence observed in asset classification and provisioning by banks vis-a-vis the Reserve Banks supervisory assessment and the steps needed to prevent it ; factors leading to an increasing incidence of frauds in banks and the measures ( including IT interventions ) needed to curb and prevent it ; and role and effectiveness of various types of audits conducted in banks in mitigating the incidence of such divergence and frauds .
The recommendations of the committee will be carried forward for implementation .
It was proposed to initiate network analysis for the financial conglomerate ( FC ) groups to assess the systemic risks posed by them .
The analysis would cover the major entities of an FC group in each financial market segment and intra-group exposures would also be considered .
The findings would be shared with the regulators and significant trends and / or concerns would be discussed in the meetings of the Inter-Regulatory Forum ( IRF ) .
In the line the evolution of regulatory guidelines on the implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) / Ind AS , the impact on quantitative and qualitative reporting by banks would be reviewed , aligned and integrated with the supervisory framework .
In an endeavour to strengthen the cyber security posture of Indian banks , focused and theme-based IT examinations are planned during 2018-19 .
Targeted scrutiny , as and when required , would also be conducted for appropriate policy and supervisory intervention .
In order to secure consistency and improve the efficiency of the offsite monitoring mechanism , an Audit Management Application portal to facilitate various supervisory functions of the Cyber Security and Information Technology Examination ( CSITE ) Cell and to fully automate monitoring of returns has been envisaged , which will be operationalised by March 2019 .
Further , there is an urgent need to strengthen the existing audit systems of banks and align them with the prevailing global best practices ( Box VI.5 ) .
VI.66 The primary responsibility of DCBS is supervising primary ( urban ) cooperative banks ( UCBs ) while also ensuring the development of a safe and well-managed cooperative banking sector .
Towards this objective , DCBS undertakes supervision of UCBs through periodic on-site and continuous off-site monitoring .
As at end-June 2018 , 1,550 UCBs were operating in the country , out of which 39 UCBs had negative net worth and 20 UCBs were under directions of the Reserve Bank .
SCBs undertake various types of audit such as statutory audit , risk based internal audit ( RBIA ) , concurrent audit , information systems ( IS ) audit and special audits .
Major fraud incidents reported by banks in the recent past have highlighted the need for improvement in the audit function and its governance .
In addition , an increase in divergence in asset classification and provisioning as assessed by the Reserve Bank vis-a-vis the audited financial statements of SCBs has been seen as a concern .
Role of Audit Committee of Boards ( ACBs ) : ACBs are mandated to provide direction , as also oversee the operation of the total audit function in SCBs .
Apart from reviewing routine items of interest , ACBs are to oversee benchmarking of banks ' systems and processes on a continuous basis so as to ensure strict adherence to internal guidelines as well as various regulatory norms .
Concurrent Audit : Concurrent audit has to be carried out on a real time or near real time basis and is expected to set the tone for subsequent internal audit which happens with a time lag .
Exception reports , even of a routine nature , are to be seen in detail on an ongoing basis .
Audit trail should be checked for diversion of funds through round tripping and other means .
Further , the auditor needs to ensure that FEMA guidelines are complied with and KYC / AML directions are implemented properly .
Internal Audit : A strong internal control system , including an independent and effective internal audit function , is a part of sound corporate governance .
The quality of internal audit was adversely affected due to inadequate human resources , lack of desired skill-sets ( particularly for specialised branches ) , non-adherence to stipulated timelines for compliance with audit findings , non-inclusion of some critical areas , etc . , indicating inadequate attention to sustainable compliance with the findings of earlier reports .
VI.67 During the year , additional emphasis was laid on the training needs of the workforce in the UCBs including the employees , management and the auditors .
Further , internal audit could not detect many frauds , which came to light after accounts turned NPA .
Fraud detection and reporting , as well as preventive steps , need to be more risk-focused so as to identify red flags at an incipient stage .
Non-adherence to Income Recognition and Asset Classification ( IRAC ) norms by banks is a major concern .
In this respect , audit function still needs to provide desired level of assurance to all stakeholders , including the Reserve Bank .
While there may be instances of information asymmetry between the supervisor and other stakeholders , NPA divergence should not arise from lack of adherence to regulatory guidelines .
Statutory Audit : Statutory auditors need to undertake root cause analysis to identify deficiencies exposed by incidents of fraud , and divergences in asset classification and provisioning .
Statutory auditors could identify issues faced by banks in implementing system-based identification of NPAs as well as utilise more effectively the central database in banks for their assignments .
Further , inputs provided by statutory auditors through Long Form Audit Report need to be improved , since they provide useful inputs for risk based supervision of banks .
This would cover , inter alia , instances of divergence identified in asset classification and provisioning during the Reserve Bank ' s inspection vis-a-vis the audited financial statements of banks above the threshold specified by the Reserve Bank in the circular issued on April 18 , 2017 .
The regional offices developed training modules to cater exclusively to the staff of UCBs .
Also , in view of the importance of corporate governance and the role of efficient management , a separate training was conducted for the chief executive officers ( CEOs ) and the board members of the UCBs .
As the auditors are the extended arm of a supervisor , they were also periodically covered separately by means of dedicated training sessions .
Apart from this , weak banks were identified based on outcome of either on-site inspection or off-site monitoring and specific hand holding programmes were arranged to focus on those areas that required improvement in the concerned banks .
VI.68 TheXBRLplatform enables standardisation and rationalisation of elements of different returns sent by banks using the internationally recognised best practices available in electronic transmission .
On rationalising the returns submitted , UCBs now submit only 22 returns that comprise of statutory , regulatory and supervisory data and information .
A return on reporting the fraud data is in the final stage of submission on the XBRL platform .
In order to overcome this challenge , innovative methodologies were adopted to achieve a proper balance between resources used and supervisory outputs .
To further smoothen the process and ensure qualitative reports on an ongoing basis , the supervisory process would be further fine-tuned to enhance its efficacy and effectiveness .
VI.70 DNBS supervises 11,174 NBFCs of which 249 are NBFC-Non Deposit taking Systemically Important ones .
During the year , NBFC sector witnessed higher asset growth .
Two new types of NBFCs , viz . , Account Aggregators and P2P lending platforms have been allowed to operate , which added to the diversity of the sector .
Agenda for 2017-18 : Implementation Status
VI.74 During the year , an enforcement policy and framework was put in place for taking enforcement action in an objective , consistent and non-partisan manner .
EFD also devised a protocol for sharing information within the Bank and initiated enforcement action with regard to commercial banks .
VI.75 During July 2017 to June 2018 , EFD undertook enforcement action against 14 banks ( including a PB and an SFB , and imposed an aggregate penalty of ₹ 1,024 million , for non-compliance / contravention of regulatory restrictions on loans and advances , violation of licensing conditions and operating guidelines for SFBs and PBs , violations of KYC norms , violations of Income Recognition and Asset Classification ( IRAC ) norms , delay in reporting of information security incidents as also for non compliance with norms relating to extending bill discounting and non-fund based facilities , detection and impounding of counterfeit notes and issue of bonus shares by private sector banks and for not adhering to specific directions issued on direct sale of securities from held to maturity ( HTM ) portfolio , among others .
VI.76 Going forward , the enforcement work pertaining to UCBs and NBFCs is being brought under the EFD in a phased manner .
VI.77 The mandate of CEPD is to monitor and ensure protection of interests of consumers of the regulated entities and maintain oversight on the administration and functioning of the Banking Ombudsman ( BO ) scheme .
The offices of NBFC Ombudsman have started functioning from four metro centres - Chennai , Kolkata , Mumbai and New Delhi and each office handles the complaints of customers of NBFCs from the respective zone .
As a measure to enhance the accountability of banks , additional compensation up to ₹ 0.1 million for harassment / mental agony , earlier available only for credit / debit card related complaints , has been extended to all types of complaints covered under the scheme .
VI.80 In order to assess the nature of mis-selling and the charges levied by banks for basic banking services , a study was conducted .
In addition , a study on KYC compliance by banks was done with a view to enhancing the security of all genuine customers .
VI.81 Consumer education has been a continuous endeavour of the Reserve Bank and during 2017-18 , the SMS handle of the Reserve Bank , viz . , RBISAY was used for spreading awareness about fictitious offers and the caution with which electronic banking facilities should be used .
Further , during the year , all the offices of BOs conducted awareness programmes , mainly in Tier II cities .
VI.82 As part of the Reserve Bank ' s initiative to improve the efficacy of grievance redressal mechanism in view of the rising number of complaints , an online Complaint Management System ( CMS ) assumes importance .
Accordingly , the process for development of an online dispute resolution mechanism for customers of banks and eligible NBFCs has started and will be completed in 2018-19 .
The Reserve Bank will formulate an Ombudsman Scheme for digital transactions and will set up offices of Ombudsman for digital transactions at select centres .
Ombudsman schemes in the financial sector , particularly in banking , is seen as the mainstay of grievance redressal for customers .
The organisation and funding of this alternative forum of dispute resolution varies across jurisdictions .
The Financial Ombudsman Scheme of the UK as also of Australia , Banking Ombudsman scheme of New Zealand and Ombudsman for Banking Services and Investments of Canada are funded by the industry while the Financial Industry Disputes Redressal Centre of Singapore charges fee from both parties to the dispute , i.e. , the complainant as well as the financial institution concerned .
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau of the USA is supported by the Federal Reserve System .
In India , the Banking Ombudsman ( BO ) scheme is the flagship consumer protection initiative which functions under the aegis of the Reserve Bank and as such does not rely on customer or industry body for carrying out its operations .
With the involvement of the central bank , the BO scheme provides a cost free and expeditious grievance redressal mechanism to customers of banks .
The BO also plays an active role in spreading awareness and imparting education on financial transactions as well as on the avenue available for grievance redressal .
In order to keep pace with the changing landscape of financial transactions , the BO scheme has been revised five times since its launch in 1995 .
Keeping in view the experience of running this scheme for customers of banks , the Reserve Bank in 2018 also implemented the Ombudsman Scheme for NBFCs .
The grievances relating to digital mode of financial transactions accounted for 19 per cent of total complaints during 2016-17 .
This has gone up to 28 per cent till end- June 2018 , particularly with the inclusion of deficiencies in mobile banking service as a ground of complaint under the scheme with effect from July 1 , 2017 .
Although a separate Ombudsman Scheme for complaints relating to digital financial transactions is not existing in other major jurisdictions , the growing trend and increasing complexity of such complaints along with the emergence of non-bank service providers in the digital payment space underlines the need for designing a dedicated Ombudsman Scheme for redressal of such grievances .
VI.84 The deposit insurance system as one of the important pillars of financial safety net provides confidence to depositors and thereby promotes financial stability .
Deposit insurance extended by DICGC covers all commercial banks including LABs , PBs , SFBs , RRBs and cooperative banks .
The number of registered insured banks as on commercial banks ( including 56 RRBs , 3 LABs , 5 PBs and 10 SFBs ) and 1,949 cooperative banks ( 33 StCBs , 364 DCCBs and 1,552 UCBs ) .
With the present limit of deposit insurance in India at ₹ 0.1 million , the number of fully protected accounts ( 1,898 million ) as at end-March 2018 constituted 92 per cent of the total number of accounts ( 2,063 million ) as against the international benchmark of 80 per cent .
In terms of amount , the total insured deposits of ₹ 33,135 billion as at end-March 2018 constituted 28 per cent of assessable deposits amounting at ₹ 118,279 billion as against the international benchmark of 20 to 30 per cent .
At the current level , the insurance cover works out to 0.9 times per capita income for 2017-18 .
VI.85 DICGC builds up its Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) through transfer of its surplus , i.e. , excess of income ( mainly comprising premia received from insured banks , interest income from investments and cash recovery out of assets of failed banks ) over expenditure ( payment of claims of depositors and related expenses ) each year , net of taxes .
This fund is available for settlement of claims of depositors of banks taken into liquidation / amalgamation .
During 2017-18 , the Corporation sanctioned total claims of ₹ 0.4 billion as against claims aggregating ₹ 0.6 billion during the preceding year .
VI.86 The Key Attributes ( KAs ) of effective resolution regimes for financial institutions issued by the Financial Stability Board ( FSB ) postulate that the objective of an effective resolution regime is to make feasible the resolution of financial institutions without severe systemic disruption and without exposing taxpayers to loss .
The resolution regime should also protect vital economic functions through mechanisms which facilitates shareholders and unsecured and uninsured creditors to absorb losses in a manner that respects the hierarchy of claims in liquidation .
The bail-in is designed as one of the tools for resolution of financial entities ( Box VI.7 ) .
NHB was set up on July 9 , 1988 , under the National Housing Bank Act , 1987 , as an apex institution for housing finance .
The primary function of NHB is to register , regulate and supervise the housing finance companies ( HFCs ) .
The entire capital of ₹ 14.5 billion of NHB is subscribed by the Reserve Bank .
VI.88 NHB also provides refinance to HFCs , SCBs , RRBs and co-operative credit institutions for housing loans and also undertakes direct lending ( project finance ) to borrowers in the public and private sector .
International Association of Deposit Insurers ( 2013 ) , " " Enhanced Guidance for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems : Deposit Insurance Coverage " , " Guidance Paper , March , available at www.iadi.org.
In the aftermath of the global financial crisis , comprehensive measures relating to resolution of failing financial institutions were undertaken by the US and the European Union ( EU ) .
In 2010 , the US established a resolution framework for systemic financial institutions under the Dodd-Frank Act .
All member states in EU were required to transpose the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive ( BRRD ) into their national law from January 2015 .
The objective of bail-in , as a tool to resolve failing financial entities , is to ensure that the losses are absorbed by shareholders and creditors without having recourse to tax payers ' money or public funds .
As per FSB ' s KAs ( FSB 2014 , 2017 ) , bail-in refers to powers of Resolution Authorities ( i ) to write down in a manner that respects the hierarchy of claims in liquidation , equity or other instruments of ownership of the firm , unsecured and uninsured creditor claims to the extent necessary to absorb the losses ; ( ii ) to convert into equity or other instruments of ownership of the firm under resolution , all or parts of unsecured and uninsured creditor claims in a manner that respects the hierarchy of claims in liquidation ; ( iii ) Convert or write-down any contingent convertible or contractual bail-in instruments whose terms had not been triggered prior to entry into resolution and treat the resulting instruments in line with ( i ) or ( ii ) .
As per the European BRRD 2014 , the main aim of bail-in is to stabilise a failing bank so that its essential services can continue , without the need for bail-out by public funds .
The tool enables authorities to recapitalise a failing bank through the write-down of liabilities and / or their conversion into equity so that the bank can continue as a going concern .
This would avoid disruption to the financial system that would otherwise occur as a result of stopping or interrupting the bank ' s critical services and give the authorities time to reorganise the bank or wind down parts of its business in an orderly manner ; recognised as an ' open bank resolution ' .
In a ' closed bank resolution ' the bank would be split into two , a good bank or bridge bank and a bad bank .
The good bank or bridge bank is a newly created legal entity which continues to operate , while the bad bank is liquidated .
As per the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation ( SRMR ) and BRRD , the scope of bail-in tool can be applied to all liabilities that are not expressly excluded from the scope of bail-in .
The resolution authority ( RA ) may wholly or partially exclude certain liabilities from the bail-in in order to avoid widespread contagion that would disrupt the functioning of financial markets , in particular , deposits held by individuals and micro , small and medium enterprises .
As per the International Association of Deposit Insurers ( IADI ) ( 2016 ) , specialised tools like bail-in aimed at resolving systemic institutions should not be applied to small and medium sized institutions .
Since the adoption of KAs of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions in November 2011 , authorities in Crisis Management Groups constituted by FSB have been working to develop firm-specific resolution strategies and plans for global systemically important banks ( G-SIBs ) .
One of the challenges that emerged was the legal and operational complexity associated with the implementation of an effective bail-in transaction .
The FSB consultative document proposes a set of principles on the execution of bail-in to assist the work of authorities .
The principles cover , inter alia , the range of actions and processes required to identify the instruments and liabilities within the scope of bail-in .
Research underscores that the bail-in framework is still evolving and even with the limited experience so far , it is recognised that the bail-in tool poses some risks for Deposit Insurance Agencies ( DIAs ) ( IADI 2015 ) .
The risks related to the use of DIA funds for bail-in arise from a change in the ownership pattern of banks after bail-in , the inappropriate use of funds , a costly resolution strategy from the DIA ' s perspective , and threats to the credibility of the DIA if resolution funding and subsequent failure of the resolved institution deplete the deposit insurance fund .

Out of the total disbursement of ₹ 249.20 billion made under refinance in 2017-18 ( July 1 , 2017 to June 30 , 2018 ) , 8.08 per cent ( ₹ 18.28 billion ) was made under the Rural Housing Fund ( RHF ) .
As a nodal agency to implement the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme ( CLSS ) under the " " Housing for All by 2022 " " mission of the government , NHB released subsidy claims of ₹ 42.85 billion to 138 Primary Lending institutions ( PLIs ) till June 30 , 2018 ( since inception ) , benefitting 1,96,543 households .
VI.89 NHB is managing the Credit Risk Guarantee Fund Trust for Low Income Housing with the objective of providing guarantees in respect of low-income housing loans .
Till June 30 , 2018 , the trust issued guarantee cover for 1977 loan accounts of 14 Member Lending Institutions ( MLIs ) involving a total loan amount of ₹ 562.40 million for economically weaker section / low income group households .
The Reserve Bank successfully achieved the objectives of the debt management by ensuring that the government ' s financing needs and its payment obligations were met at the lowest possible cost .
Notwithstanding the multiple challenges emanating from the glide path for reduction in Held of Maturity ( HTM ) category of banks ' investment portfolio and Statutory Liquidity Ratio ( SLR ) , the Reserve Bank managed the borrowing requirements of the central and the state governments for 2017-18 within the overall contours of the debt management strategy of low cost , risk mitigation and market development while factoring in domestic and global economic and financial conditions .
On the macroeconomic front , the tilting risks to inflation , pressure emanating from the fiscal slippages , event-specific announcements , viz . , farm loan waivers coupled with global factors such as the increasing crude oil prices and the monetary policy normalisation in major economies were the pre-dominant factors that impacted the yields .
The combined gross market borrowings of central and state governments during 2017-18 increased by 4.5 per cent over the previous year to ₹ 10,071 billion .
Following the strategy of consolidation and increase in the issuance limit per security , during 2017-18 , 156 out of 159 issuances of the Government of India ( Gol ) securities were re-issuances , whereas during 2016-17 , 156 were reissued out of the total 164 issuances .
In continuation of the foregoing objective , the strategy of front-loading of issuances continued to be followed in 2017-18 to even out the borrowing pressures throughout the year .
Active consolidation of debt was undertaken in the form of buyback / switches ( ₹ 415.55 billion / ₹ 580.75 billion ) that spread across 2017-18 , totalling ₹ 996.30 billion as compared to ₹ 1,046.43 billion in the previous year .
Further , with a view to improving flexibility in borrowing , the Gol introduced the greenshoe option of up to ₹ 10 billion in September 2017 within each maturity bucket such that the aggregate amount accepted in the auction does not exceed the total notified amount .
The share of Floating Rate Bonds ( FRBs ) in total issuances during 2017-18 stood at 10.2 per cent .
Reflecting the strategy of maturity elongation , the weighted average maturity ( WAM ) of primary issuance of government securities ( G-sec ) was at 14.13 years during 2017-18 .
This was , however , lower than 14.76 years for the previous year , as the government decided to borrow more in the maturity buckets of under 15 years to contain cost of borrowings in the volatile market conditions .
The rollover risk for Gol dated securities continued to be low as the WAM of outstanding dated securities remained at 10.62 years in 2017-18 , marginally lower than 10.65 years recorded in the previous year , reflecting higher issuances in the lower maturity buckets especially in the last quarter of 2017-18 .
In order to assist the states in this regard , a study on best practices was presented in the 30th State Finance Secretaries ( SFS ) Conference .
The draft recommendations of the Working Group on Monitoring and Reporting of Contingent Liabilities ( CLs ) of State Governments were also deliberated in the SFS conference , covering aspects relating to better management , monitoring and reporting of CLs by state governments .
Further , efforts to sensitise the state governments on cash and debt management continued with capacity building programmes held for five state governments during 2017-18 .
The Union Budget 2017-18 had estimated gross market borrowing through dated G-sec at ₹ 5,800 billion .
The actual gross market borrowings through dated G-sec in 2017-18 amounted to ₹ 5,880 billion on account of additional market borrowings by the Gol in Q3 .
Net borrowings through dated securities amounted to ₹ 4,484 billion , financing 75.3 per cent of the gross fiscal deficit ( GFD ) as against 76.2 per cent in the previous year .
The gross market borrowing through the Gol dated securities during 2017-18 increased by 1.0 per cent while the net market borrowings increased by 9.8 per cent during the same period , on account of lesser repayments during the year ( ₹ 1,395.90 billion in 2017-18 against ₹ 1,738.02 billion in 2016-17 ) .
The net market borrowing of the central government through dated securities and T-Bills increased by ₹ 1,206 billion to ₹ 4,989 billion in 2017-18 ( Table VII.1 ) .
VII.6 Notwithstanding the volatility in the bond market conditions , the weighted average yield ( WAY ) for Gol dated securities issued during 2017-18 declined by 19 bps to 6.97 per cent from 7.16 per cent in 2016-17 ( Chart VII.1 ) .
This helped bring down the weighted average cost of borrowings on the outstanding debt stock by 23 bps to 7.76 per cent in 2017-18 .
Following the decision of Gol not to borrow in the tenors above 15 years in the last quarter of the year , the WAM of issuances during 2017-18 slid to 14.13 years ( 14.76 years in 2016-17 ) .
Consequently , WAM on the outstanding debt decreased marginally to 10.62 years in 2017-18 from 10.65 years in 2016-17 ( Table VII.2 ) .
VII.7 Among the factors driving the G-sec yields , the domestic factors outweighed the global factors in 2017-18 .
During most part of H1 , the G-sec yields reflected a softening trajectory mainly driven by lower inflation , sustained demand from Foreign Portfolio Investors ( FPIs ) and a 25 bps cut in the policy repo rate in August 2017 .
The G-sec yields , however , hardened in Q3 , mostly led by domestic factors , viz . , informal Communication by the government on higher GFD , increase in inflation forecast by the Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) and concerns over increase in supply of government paper in the form of bank recapitalisation bonds .
Among global factors , the rising crude oil prices and an increase in the US Fed fund rate further impacted the G-sec yields .
In Q4 , notwithstanding the announcement of reduction in additional borrowings by the Gol , the upward pressure on yields resumed on the back of elevated crude oil prices and spillovers from global bond sell-off , accentuated by fears of oversupply of domestic government of paper .
VII.8 During 2017-18 , about 53.6 per cent of the market borrowings were raised through issuance of dated securities with a residual maturity of over 10 years as compared with 58.8 per cent in the previous year , which led to an increase in the share of securities with maturity under 10 years .
To cater to the demand of long-term investors like insurance companies and pension funds , 29-year and 33-year tenor bonds were reissued during the year ( Table VII.3 ) .
VII.10 Commercial banks remained the largest holders of dated securities , accounting for 41.4 per cent as at end-June 2018 , followed by insurance companies and provident funds holding 24.2 per cent and 5.8 per cent , respectively .
The share of the Reserve Bank ' s holding stood at 11.6 per cent while FPls held 3.8 per cent .
The other holders included the co-operative banks , mutual funds , financial institutions and corporates .
VII.11 The share of primary dealers ( PDs ) in the subscription to primary auctions of central government securities stood at 53.7 per cent in 2017-18 as compared to 47.6 per cent in 2016-17 .
The underwriting commission paid to PDs during 2017-18 increased to ₹ 0.61 billion as compared to ₹ 0.36 billion during the previous year , mainly on account of volatile bond market conditions .
There were three instances of devolvement in four central government securities on PDs for an amount of ₹ 102.97 billion as compared to four instances for ₹ 53 billion in 2016-17 .
In order to facilitate the Standalone Primary Dealers ( SPDs ) in providing comprehensive services to their FPI clients , it has been decided in the second bi-monthly monetary policy for 2018-19 to provide the SPDs a limited foreign exchange license .
VII.12 The SGB scheme launched by the Gol in November 2015 was improved upon further in 2017-18 for ease of access of investment and to widen the investor base .
The Reserve Bank , in consultation with the GoI , issued 14 tranches of SGBs for an aggregate amount of ₹ 18.95 billion ( 6.52 ton ) during 2017-18 as compared to ₹ 34.69 billion ( 11.44 ton ) in 2016-17 , reflecting low investor appetite .
A total of ₹ 68.96 billion ( 23.53 ton ) has been raised through the scheme since its inception until June 30 , 2018 .
VII.13 The government ' s borrowing programmes are planned and executed in terms of the debt management strategy ( DMS ) .
The objective of DMS is to secure the government ' s funding at all times at low cost over the medium / long term while avoiding excessive risk .
The DMS has been articulated for the medium-term for a period of three years and is reviewed annually and rolled over for the next three years .
The government published its first DMS on December 31 , 2015 and thereafter in March 2018 .
The current scope of the Medium-Term Debt Strategy ( MTDS ) under DMS ( 2017-20 ) has been expanded to include other components such as external debt and small savings schemes in addition to internal marketable debt .
The present debt profile is analysed with regard to cost , maturity and potential risk factors .
The DMS revolves around three broad pillars , viz . , low cost , risk mitigation and market development .
The low-cost objective is attained by planned issuances and offer of appropriate instruments in the medium to long-run , taking into account market conditions and preferences of various investor segments .
Scenario analysis , under the MTDS has estimated the expected cost of debt based on the assumptions of future interest rates , exchange rates and future borrowing needs .
The debt sustainability analysis has looked at indicators , such as , debt to GDP , average time to maturity and interest expense to GDP .
Stress tests to ascertain debt sustainability by subjecting debt to economic and financial shocks have indicated a very low level of stress .
The analysis confirms that the debt is stable and sustainable over the medium to long run .
The net short- term market borrowing of the government through T-Bills increased to ₹ 504.81 billion in 2017-18 as against a net repayment of ₹ 298.92 billion in 2016-17 due to increased issuances during H1 of 2017-18 , reflecting the pressures Gol witnessed during the period .
The PDs individually achieved the stipulated minimum success ratio of 40 per cent in bidding for T-Bill .
The PDs share in the T-Bill auctions during the year declined to 66.5 per cent as compared to 74.4 per cent in 2016-17 , reflecting the increased demand for T-Bills from the other segments of the market .
VII.15 The government started the fiscal year 2017-18 with a cash balance of ₹ 1,303.50 billion .
The WMA limit for the first and second quarter and second half of 2017-18 was fixed at ₹ 600 billion , ₹ 700 billion and ₹ 250 billion , respectively .
The government ' s cash position remained under stress during the first half of 2017-18 mainly on account of the advancement of the presentation of the Union Budget and front-loading of expenditure .
Consequently , WMA increased to 106 days in 2017-18 as against 25 days during the previous year coupled with overdraft ( OD ) for 6 days in 2017-18 vis-a-vis 1 day during the previous year .
The highest WMA / OD recorded the continuous stress amidst lower and uncertain tax revenue stream on account of introduction of Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) during the first half , the government also issued Cash Management Bills ( CMBs ) for ₹ 1,500 billion of tenors between 15 to 80 days .
The cash position improved subsequently , as tax flows stabilised and disinvestment process accelerated .
The government ended the fiscal year 2017-18 with a cash balance of ₹ 1,675.55 billion ( Chart VII.2 ) .
The WMA limit for the first quarter of 2018-19 was fixed at ₹ 600 billion .
VII.16 States dependence on the market borrowing programme has increased significantly over the years .
As per the recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission ( FC ) , states opted out ( barring Delhi , Madhya Pradesh , Kerala and Arunachal Pradesh ) of the National Small Savings Fund ( NSSF ) financing facility from 2016-17 .
Consequently , market borrowings of states increased , also triggered by large redemption pressure from past borrowings , in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008 .
The share of market borrowings in financing GFD increased from 64.1 per cent in 2016-17 to 66.1 per cent in 2017-18 ( RE ) mainly due to the termination of NSSF financing facility .
This aggravated the impact on bond yields over market concerns on oversupply of sovereign paper .
VII.17 State governments raised market borrowings of ₹ 4,191 billion in gross and ₹ 3,403 billion in net during 2017-18 , as compared to ₹ 3,820 billion and ₹ 3,427 billion respectively , raised in the previous year .
The gross market borrowings of state governments in 2017-18 has increased by 9.7 per cent while the net borrowings declined by 0.7 per cent , due to higher repayments .
There were 411 successful issuances in 2017-18 , out of which 43 were re-issuances , reflecting the concerted efforts by the states towards consolidation of debt ( Table VII.4 ) .
VII.18 The weighted average yield ( WAY ) of State Development Loans ( SDLs ) issued during 2017-18 stood higher at 7.67 per cent compared to 7.48 per cent in the previous year .
Despite hardening of yields across securities , the weighted average spread of SDL issuances over comparable central government securities stood at 59 bps as compared to 60 bps in 2016-17 .
In 2017-18 , nine states and the Union Territory of Puducherry issued non-standard securities of tenors ranging from 3 to 25 years .
As a strategic response to higher spreads , ten states rejected all the bids received in some of the auctions conducted .
Following the policy of passive consolidation , states like Maharashtra , Odisha and Tamil Nadu undertook reissuances amounting to ₹ 472.62 billion during 2017-18 to improve the liquidity of their securities in the secondary market .
However , the inter-state spread at 6 bps in 2017-18 was marginally lower than 7 bps in 2016-17 , reflecting that the relationship between the spread on SDLs and fiscal situation of individual states remained weak during 2017-18 as well .
In this context , an inter-departmental group was set up to explore various options available to move towards appropriate pricing of SDLs .
Accordingly , the monetary policy statement issued in October 2017 announced the following measures for implementation , viz . : ( i ) consolidation of state government debt to improve liquidity in SDLs through reissuances and buybacks ; ( ii ) conducting of weekly auctions of SDLs ; and ( iii ) publishing of high frequency data relating to finances of state governments available with the Reserve Bank .
Consequently , with effect from October 2017 , the data on Consolidated Sinking Fund ( CSF ) , Guarantee Redemption Fund ( GRF ) , held by the states , investments in Intermediate Treasury Bills ( ITBs ) and Auction Treasury Bills ( ATBs ) as well as financial accommodation in the form of WMA / OD are being published in the RBI Bulletin .
In addition , weekly auctions of SDLs have commenced with effect from October 2017 .
VII.19 With a view to incentivising the state governments to get SDLs rated , it has been decided in the second bi-monthly monetary policy for 2018-19 to set the initial margin requirement for rated SDLs , submitted as collaterals in LAF Repo / MSF window , at 1.0 per cent lower than that of non-rated SDLs for the same maturity buckets , i.e. , in the range of 1.5 per cent to 5.0 per cent .
Further , to align the value of SDLs with the prevailing market price , the state government securities held by banks in their investment portfolio will , henceforth , be valued on observed prices , i.e. , the price at which the securities have been traded in the market .
In case of non-traded state government securities , valuation will be done based on the state-specific weighted average spread over the yield of the central government securities of equivalent maturity as observed at primary auctions .
VII.20 As envisaged by the Advisory Committee on Ways and Means Advances Scheme for the State Governments , 2016 ( Chairman : Shri Sumit Bose ) , a review of the current WMA limits was undertaken during 2017-18 .
Based on the trends in the utilisation of WMA facilities , it was decided to retain the existing limits ( ₹ 322.25 billion for all states together ) of WMA until reviewed by the next committee ( effective from 2020-21 ) .
In the year 2017-18 , thirteen states resorted to WMA while seven states availed overdraft facility .
VII.21 States have been accumulating sizeable cash surplus in recent years in the form of Intermediate Treasury Bills ( ITBs ) and Auction Treasury Bills ( ATBs ) .
As a result , liquidity pressures were confined only to a few states in 2017-18 .
Though positive cash balances indicate low intra-year fiscal pressures , it involves a negative carry of interest rates for the states , warranting improvement in cash management practices by states ( Box VII.1 ) .
The outstanding investments of states in ITBs as at end-March 2018 stood at ₹ 1,508.71 billion as against ₹ 1,560.58 billion in the previous year , while outstanding investments of states in ATBs stood at ₹ 621.08 billion as against ₹ 366.03 billion at end-March 2017 ( Table VII.5 ) .
The 69.7 per cent jump in investments in ATBs reflect the states efforts at reducing the negative carry .
Source : RBI .
With most states opting out of National Small Saving Fund ( NSSF ) and other sources being often project-linked , states , reliance on market borrowings to finance their rapidly increasing gross fiscal deficits has increased considerably .
Interestingly , the cash build up has also been rising with a sharp rise in gross borrowings , which has left them with large cash surplus as at end-March .
The surplus , however , is generally seen to be concentrated with few states .
The cash surplus would show up when states mobilise resources in excess of their fiscal deficit requirements .
Also , if expenditures ear-marked for the identified purpose or allocated to lower parastatals / agencies / schemes do not take place or are not utilised , unutilised funds would boost the surplus with the states .
While the central government issues both T-Bills and dated securities for its financing needs , state governments issue only dated securities , which makes them vulnerable at times of financial stress .
This threshold cash buffer , however , needs to be arrived at on the basis of some set criteria / historic trend , for instance , it could be a month ' s expenditure cover . Ending the years with large unutilised cash balances due to such factors as given above , for continuous long periods , puts unnecessary and avoidable interest burden that results from the negative carry if such surpluses have been built from borrowed sources and are invested in Intermediate Treasury Bills / Auction Treasury Bills at lower rates ( Chart 1 ) .
While market borrowings by the centre have largely stagnated in recent times , states increased reliance on market borrowings in the wake of a limited resource base and constrained internal fund mobilisation against rising fiscal gap , has led to an oversupply of government paper in the G-sec market pushing up the yield .
In particular , large market borrowings by the states , which they do not immediately need , increase the yield for the 10-year benchmark security , as most of the state borrowings till recently have been in the 10-year maturity bucket .
More importantly , higher supply of SDLs vis-a-vis central government dated bonds to finance the consolidated GFD would tend to increase consolidated government borrowing cost due to SDL illiquidity and premia over central G-sec .
In such a situation when states are using up the space vacated by centre , it is necessary to recalibrate the incentives in order to make states resort to need-based market borrowings .
Foremost , states need to make efforts towards better expenditure management and cash forecasting for effective cash management .
Effective expenditure management post allocation of budgetary funds is central to the government ' s ability to control spending to deal with rising deficits and costs .
This would obviate the need to keep more than prudent cash surplus which involves negative carry .
Secondly , states ' reliance on market borrowings may also lessen if states find more ways to mobilise resources internally , for instance , by levying appropriate user charges for services provided by them / their undertakings .
A shift from fortnightly issuances to weekly SDLs auctions , in addition to Gol providing sanction under article 293 ( 3 ) of the Constitution for 9 months at a stretch at the beginning of the year , has given states the flexibility to enter the market at appropriate time and as required .
In this regard , the 13th Finance Commission ( FC ) had recommended that ' there should be a directed effort by states with large balances towards utilising their existing cash balances before resorting to fresh borrowings ' .
The 15th FC can also deliberate on the allocated but unutilised funds , perhaps due to capacity constraints that end-up as surplus for long periods of time in the hands of states , and how these can be gainfully utilised elsewhere and thereby , reduce the extent of fresh borrowings .
Though most of the states are investing in long-term instruments by maintaining CSF / GRF , the liquidation is only for specific purposes .
Other than non-marketable 14-days T-Bills that offer low returns , and Auction T-Bills that lock the funds for a longer tenor , states ' avenues for investment of their surplus in short maturities are limited .
The 15th FC can explore the alternate short-term investment avenues for states to park funds till their utilisation at better returns and thereby , help reduce negative carry .
The Reserve Bank is also taking steps towards consolidation of state debt through reissuances .
Improving the availability of high-frequency data on state finances is a step forward towards improving market discipline which may restrain states from excessive borrowings at higher costs .
In order to further incentivise maintenance of adequate funds by state governments in CSF and GRF , and to encourage them to increase the corpus of these funds , the rate of interest on SDF against CSF / GRF has been lowered to 200 bps ( as against 100 bps earlier ) below the repo rate vide the second bi-monthly monetary policy statement of 2018-19 .
Outstanding investment by states in the CSF and GRF as at end-March 2018 stood at ₹ 992.71 billion and ₹ 54.38 billion , respectively .
Total investment in CSF / GRF was ₹ 194.42 billion in 2017-18 and total disinvestment from the funds stood at ₹ 4.27 billion .
VII.23 The Union Budget 2018-19 estimated the gross market borrowing through dated securities at ₹ 6,055 billion , higher by about 3 per cent as compared with ₹ 5,880 billion in 2017-18 .
Net market borrowing at ₹ 4,621 billion is envisaged to increase by 3 per cent during the same period .
The Union Budget 2018-19 has also provided for net short-term borrowings of ₹ 170 billion .
VII.24 The market borrowing programme of the central and state governments would continue to be guided by the following strategic measures within the overall objective of developing a deep and liquid market for G-sec as well as SDLs :
Elongation of maturity profile of the government debt will be undertaken under conducive market conditions .
The features of CPI linked Inflation Indexed Bonds ( IIBs ) will be examined to cater to diverse investor base .
Investor base will be broadened by working with state governments to manage their State Disaster Response Funds ( SDRFs ) through investment in G-sec and T-Bills and also by greater participation of foreign central banks in the G-sec market .
A dashboard will be created to present information on the G-sec market covering important variables including gross and net borrowings of central and state governments .
Currency management during 2017-18 was geared towards managing the process of remonetisation and processing and reconciliation of specified banknotes ( SBNs ) .
The year was marked by issuance of banknotes of ₹ 10 and ₹ 50 under the new series and introduction of ₹ 200 , a new denomination .
New banknotes under the Mahatma Gandhi ( New ) Series highlighting the cultural heritage and scientific achievements of the country were issued .
Sustained efforts were made towards indigenisation of banknotes production with sophisticated security features .
VIII.1 The focus of currency management during 2017-18 broadly remained on remonetisation , processing and reconciliation of SBNs received at the Reserve Bank from circulation .
This humungous task of processing and verification of SBNs was successfully achieved with the co-ordinated efforts put in by the work force of the Issue Department of the Reserve Bank .
Ceaseless efforts towards remonetisation continued during the year which saw issuance of banknotes of ₹ 10 and ₹ 50 under the new series and introduction of ₹ 200 , a new denomination .
VIII.2 The value of banknotes in circulation increased by 37.7 per cent over the year to ₹ 18,037 billion as at end-March 2018 .
The share of newly introduced ₹ 200 banknotes in the total value of banknotes in circulation was 2.1 per cent as at end-March 2018 .
In volume terms , ₹ 10 and ₹ 100 banknotes constituted 51.6 per cent of total banknotes in circulation as at end- March 2018 as compared to 62.0 per cent at end-March 2017 ( Table VIII.1 ) .
Source : RBI .
VIII.3 Coins in circulation witnessed a small increase during the year compared to the position as at end-March 2017 .
The total value of coins in circulation increased by 2.4 per cent in 2017-18 as against 14.7 per cent last year , while the total volume of coins in circulation increased by 2.4 per cent as compared to 8.5 per cent in of ₹ 1 , ₹ 2 and ₹ 5 together constituted 83.3 per cent of the total volume of coins in circulation , while in value terms , these accounted for 77.7 per cent ( Table VIII.2 ) .
VIII.4 The currency management infrastructure consists of a network of 19 issue offices of the Reserve Bank , 3,975 currency chests ( including sub-treasury offices and a currency chest of the Reserve Bank at Kochi ) and 3,654 small coin depots of commercial , co-operative and regional rural banks spread across the country ( Table VIII.3 ) .
VIII.5 On account of demonetisation , 2016-17 was an exceptional year and the after-effects continued in 2017-18 as well .
Accordingly , the indent for 2017-18 was higher by 9.1 per cent as compared to last year .
VIII.7 Banknotes under the Mahatma Gandhi ( New ) Series were launched from November 2016 , highlighting the cultural heritage and scientific achievements of the country .
During the year , in continuation of the earlier release of banknotes in the denominations of ₹ 2000 and ₹ 500 , banknotes of ₹ 200 , ₹ 50 and ₹ 10 denominations of the same series were also introduced ( Table VIII.6 ) .
@ : Total excludes ₹ 1 .
Note : BRBNMPL : Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Private Limited .
SPMCIL : Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Limited .
VIII.8 During the year , 27.7 billion pieces of banknotes were disposed as against 12.5 billion pieces last year , mainly on account of accelerated processing of SBNs of ₹ 500 and ₹ 1000 denominations ( Table VIII.7 ) .
VIII.9 During 2017-18 , 522,783 pieces of counterfeit notes were detected in the banking system , of which 63.9 per cent were detected by banks other than the Reserve Bank ( Table VIII.8 ) .
Table VIII.5 : Indent and Supply of Coins by Mints ( April-March )
Detection of counterfeit notes was 31.4 per cent lower than the previous year .
Counterfeit notes detected in SBNs decreased by 59.7 and 59.6 per cent in the denominations of ₹ 500 and ₹ 1000 , respectively , as the same comprised only the residual part of SBN deposits processed during the year 2017-18 .
Compared to the previous year , there was an increase of 35 per cent in counterfeit notes detected in the denomination of ₹ 100 , while there was a noticeable increase of 154.3 per cent in counterfeit notes detected in the denomination of ₹ 50 .
In the Mahatma Gandhi ( New ) Series of banknotes in the denominations of ₹ 500 and ₹ 2000 , counterfeit notes detected during 2017-18 were 9,892 and 17,929 as against 199 and 638 , respectively during the previous year ( Table VIII.9 ) .
Table VIII.8 : Number of Counterfeit Notes Detected ( April-March )
Does not include counterfeit notes seized by the police and other enforcement agencies .
Out of the total Fake Indian Currency Notes ( FICNs ) detected , the share of FICNs detected at the Reserve Bank was higher at 36.1 per cent as compared to 4.3 per cent during the previous year .
This was because of processing of large volume of SBNs withdrawn from circulation .
Table VIII.9 : Denomination-wise Counterfeit Notes Detected in the Banking System ( April-March )
VIII.10 The total expenditure incurred on security printing during the year ( July 2017 - June 2018 ) stood at ₹ 49.12 billion as against ₹ 79.65 billion in 2016-17 .
The security features notified for procurement included security threads with colour shift and moving images , colour shifting inks , foil patch , security fibres , ink and paper based taggants , advanced watermark and micro-perforation .
VIII.12 The Reserve Bank has introduced incentives for installation of various machines in addition to performance based incentives in order to encourage banks to use technology in currency operations for providing better customer service .
The incentives for installation of machines were rationalised in May 2016 and installation of only Cash Recyclers and ATMs dispensing lower denomination notes , was incentivised .
As the purpose of installing these machines was largely met , it was decided to withdraw the incentives with effect from March 02 , 2018 .
VIII.13 To augment its banknote processing capacity , the Reserve Bank initiated the tendering process for replacement of 50 CVPS machines with new ones during the year .
VIII.4 The introduction of a new series of banknotes with different dimensions as compared to the earlier series notes and the introduction of new denominations of banknotes of ₹ 2000 and ₹ 200 necessitated an amendment to the Reserve Bank of India ( Note Refund ) Rules , 2009 .
The required changes are expected to be notified through a Gazette Notification shortly .
International experience suggests that varnishing of banknotes is expected to increase their life and durability , reduce the banknote replacement requirements and thereby lower the overall security printing expenditure .
It is proposed to introduce varnished banknotes on a field trial basis .
VIII.16 As announced in the fourth bi-monthly monetary policy statement on October 4 , 2016 , the entire gamut of security of treasure in transit was reviewed through two committees , viz . , the High Level Committee on Currency Storage and Movement ( HLCCSM ) ( Chairman : Shri N. S. Vishwanathan , Deputy Governor ) and the Committee on Currency Movement ( CCM ) ( Chairman : Shri Deepak Mohantly , Executive Director ) .
The recommendations of the CCM and Expert Group are in various stages of implementation .
VIII.17 In terms of the Specified Banknotes ( Cessation of Liabilities ) Act 2017 , a grace period was provided to Indian citizens who were outside India between November 9 and December 30 , 2016 to deposit SBNs held by them at any of the five Reserve Bank Offices ( Mumbai , New Delhi , Chennai , Kolkata , and Nagpur ) , subject to certain conditions .
In terms of the Government of India notification , the grace period for a resident of India was available till March 31 , 2017 and that for non-resident Indian citizens till June 30 , 2017 .
Under this scheme , around 77,000 tenders were received , of which around 68 per cent were found to be eligible for payment .
VIII.18 During the year , the Government of India notified on May 12 , 2017 the Specified Bank Notes ( Deposit of Confiscated Notes ) Rules , 2017 under which SBNs confiscated or seized by law enforcement agencies or produced before a court on or before December 30 , 2016 may be tendered at any office of the Bank for deposit in a bank account or exchange of the value thereof with legal tender , subject to conditions stipulated in the said Rules .
Pursuant to the fourth bi-monthly monetary policy statement for the year 2016-17 issued on October 04 , 2016 , the Reserve Bank had constituted two committees , viz . , the High Level Committee on Currency Storage and Movement ( HLCCSM ) and the Committee on Currency Movement ( CCM ) to review the movement of notes up to currency chest level and further downstream , respectively .
The HLCCSM has submitted an interim report .
Meanwhile an international expert has been appointed to assist the committee .
The CCM has since submitted its report , suggesting measures to make the retail currency circulation system in India , more efficient and secure .
The recommendations of the committee are in various stages of implementation .
Currency management is one of the core central banking functions of the Reserve Bank .
The responsibility of maintaining integrity and quality of banknotes and ensuring public confidence rests with the Bank .
With a view to examining the systems , processes and quality control mechanisms in place at the note printing presses and paper mills , an Expert Group ( Chairman : Shri C. Krishnan , former Executive Director ) was constituted to conduct and audit of the entire gamut of note printing and all its attendant processes .
The Expert Group has submitted its report and has made recommendations for standardisation of raw material procurement , quality assurance , note printing processes , security features , etc . , across all the presses and the paper mills .
VIII.19 The Government of India has also notified on June 20 , 2017 the Specified Banknotes ( Deposit by Banks , Post Offices and District Central Co-operative Banks ) Rules , 2017 , allowing the Bank to accept within a period of 30 days from the date of notification and subject to certain conditions specified in the said Rules , SBNs from ( i ) any bank or Post Office that had received SBNs from its customers on or before December 30 , 2016 , and ( ii ) DCCBs that had received SBNs from their customers between November 10-14 , 2016 .
The facility to accept eligible SBNs in terms of these Rules was made available at 19 Regional Offices of the Bank till July 19 , 2017 .
VIII.20 The SBNs received were verified , counted and processed in the sophisticated high speed CVPS for accuracy and genuineness and shredded and briquetted in the Shredding and Briquetting system .
The processing capacity was augmented by resorting to night shifts ( along with day shifts ) , working for 6 days a week , using 8 additional machines available with commercial banks and taking 7 machines on lease from vendors .
Diversion of SBNs from Issue Circles having surplus SBNs to Issue Circles having surplus processing capacity was also effected for ensuring near simultaneous completion of processing at all the Issue Offices of the Bank .
The processing of SBNs has since been completed at all centres of the Reserve Bank .
The total SBNs returned from circulation is ₹ 15,310.73 billion .
VIII.21 In order to create awareness , remove misconceptions and allay fears in the mind of the pubic regarding coins , the Reserve Bank undertook an SMS awareness campaign during the year .
The legal tender character of ₹ 10 coins of different designs was also reiterated vide a press release on the Reserve Bank ' s website .
VIII.22 At present , management of inventory relating to currency operations , reporting of currency chest transactions and accounting thereof , generation of MIS reports , etc . , are being carried out through an Integrated Computerised Currency Operations & Management System ( ICCOMS ) at the Reserve Bank and currency chests .
ICCOMS is going to be replaced with a currency management module in the Bank ' s Core Banking Solution ( e-Kuber ) which will improve inventory management , facilitate near real time accounting of currency chest transactions , enable better tracking of currency in circulation and cover all related activities of currency chests , link offices and Regional Offices of the Reserve Bank .
VIII.23 Based on the recommendation of the Group of Experts for Review of Systems and Processes relating to banknote production ( Chairman : Shri C. Krishnan ) , the Department of Currency Management has initiated the process of setting up a laboratory at Mumbai for banknote quality assurance .
VIII.24 Considering the huge volume of banknotes that is being handled / likely to be handled in future , there is an emergent need for upgrading the infrastructure and processes for currency management in the country by inducting modern technology and automation .
The Reserve Bank will explore the possibility of mechanising the processes by adopting suitable technology .
VIII.25 Established in 1995 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank to augment the country ' s banknote production capacity , BRBNMPL has contributed immensely to achieving strategic objectives in the field of currency management .
The achievements of the company during the year included supplying around two-thirds of the total banknotes received by the Reserve Bank , indigenously designing the Mahatma Gandhi ( New ) Series banknotes and continuing with extensive automation and Enterprise Resource Planning .
Along with SPMCIL , BRBNMPL has set up Bank Note Paper Mill India Private Limited ( BNPMIPL ) , an entity producing Cylinder Watermarked Bank Note ( CWBN ) paper required for banknote production .
BRBNMPL has set up an ink factory at Mysuru , which will shortly go into mass production .
The Reserve Bank ' s endeavour to build a less-cash society continued with the large scale adoption of digital modes of payments in the country .
Accordingly , the Bank worked towards building up a robust and resilient technology infrastructure which ensured smooth functioning of the critical and systemically important payment and settlement systems in the country .
The Department of payment and Settlement Systems ( DPSS ) continued to work on the strategic initiatives set in the ' Payment and Settlement Systems in India : Vision 2018 ' document .
This resulted in achievement of the expected outcomes laid out in the vision through : ( i ) decrease in the share of paper-based clearing instruments ; ( ii ) consistent growth in individual segments of retail electronic payment systems , viz . , National Electronic Funds Transfer ( NEFT ) , Immediate Payment Service ( IMPS ) , card transactions and mobile banking ; ( iii ) increase in registered customer base for mobile banking ; and ( iv ) upscaling of the acceptance infrastructure for digital payments .
Further , with the rapid adoption of digital payments across the country , aided by the introduction of innovative products in the payment space , the Bank focused on strengthening infrastructure and ensuring safety and security of digital transactions .
The payment and settlement systems recorded robust growth in 2017-18 , with volume and value growing at 44.6 per cent and 11.9 per cent , respectively , on top of an increase of 56.0 per cent and 24.8 per cent , respectively , in 2016-17 .
The share of electronic transactions in the total volume of retail payments increased to 92.6 per cent in 2017-18 , up from 88.9 per cent in the previous year with a corresponding reduction in the share of paper based clearing instruments from 11.1 per cent in 2016-17 to 7.4 per cent in 2017-18 ( Table IX.1 ) .
At the end of March 2018 , the RTGS facility was available through 1,37,924 branches of 194 banks .
The NEFT system handled 1.9 billion transactions valued at around ₹ 172 trillion in 2017-18 , up from 1.6 billion transactions valued at ₹ 120 trillion in the previous year , registering a growth of 20 per cent in terms of volume and 43.5 per cent in terms of value .
At the end of March 2018 , the NEFT facility was available through 1,40,339 branches of 192 banks , in addition to a large number of business correspondent ( BC ) outlets .
Settlement of Collateralised Borrowing and Lending Obligation ( CBLO ) , government securities clearing and forex transactions are through the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd . ( CCIL ) .
Government Securities include outright trades and both legs of repo transactions .
The figures for cards are for transactions at point of sale ( POS ) terminals only , which include online transactions .
Figures in the columns might not add up to the total due to rounding off of numbers .
ECS DR : Electronic Clearing System Debit , ECS CR : Electronic Clearing System Credit .
Prepaid payment instruments ( PPIs ) recorded a volume of about 3.5 billion transactions , valued at ₹ 1,416 billion .
Mobile banking services witnessed a growth of 92 per cent and 13 per cent in volume and value terms , respectively , while the number of registered customers rose by 54 per cent to 251 million at end-March 2018 from 163 million at end-March 2017 .
The acceptance infrastructure also witnessed substantial growth with the number of Point of Sale ( POS ) terminals deployed increasing by 24 per cent from 2.53 million in 2016-17 to 3.14 million in 2017-18 .
Digital mode of payments was facilitated through 84 authorised payment system operators ( PSOs ) as against 87 in June 2017 , comprising PPI issuers , cross-border money transfer service providers-in bound , White Label ATM Operators ( WLAOs ) , Trade Receivables Discounting System ( TReDS ) operators , ATM networks , instant money transfer service providers , card payment networks and Bharat Bill Payment Operating Units ( BBPOUs ) , besides the Clearing Corporation of India Limited ( CCIL ) and the National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) .
The number of non-bank entities authorised for operating PPls decreased to 49 from 55 in the previous year due to the merger / conversion of some entities into payment banks and voluntary surrender of license by the entities .
While 58 banks were granted approval to issue PPls , 430 banks were permitted to provide mobile banking services up to end-June 2018 .
In the ' Payment and Settlement Systems in India : Vision 2018 ' , the Department had identified four strategic pillars for achieving its vision .
The developments in each of the areas are detailed below .
By providing guaranteed settlement services in the markets , the CCPs protect the participants from losses due to counterparty defaults , replacement-cost risk , and principal risk .
Guidelines for setting up and operating white label ATMs ( WLA ) in India were first issued in June 2012 .
Based on experience and industry representations , the guidelines have been amended from time to time .
To further facilitate the utilisation of WLAs , WLAOs have been permitted to source cash from retail outlets .
Notwithstanding this , the WLAOs have not been able to meet the targets prescribed under the respective schemes .
In view of this , a complete review of WLA guidelines would be undertaken in 2018-19 from the perspective of entry point norms of WLA , deployment targets / entry of new players , etc .
The Reserve Bank released the ' Master Direction on Issuance and Operation of Prepaid Payment Instruments ( PPls ) ' on October 11 , 2017 .
The major modifications made in the Master Direction relate to changes in entry point norms , KYC requirements , consolidation of various categories of PPls , safety and security of transactions as well as systems , customer protection and grievance redressal mechanism , fraud prevention and risk management framework .
In addition , the Master Direction prescribes a path for implementation of interoperability amongst PPIs issued by banks and authorised non-banks .
In order to achieve the twin objectives of promoting debit card acceptance by a wider set of merchants ( especially the small merchants ) and ensuring sustainability of the business for the entities involved , the Merchant Discount Rate ( MDR ) framework was rationalised effective January 1 , 2018 .
Banks are required to withdraw non- Cheque Truncation System ( CTS ) - 2010 Standard cheques in circulation by creating awareness among customers .
The share of non-CTS-2010 cheques in total cheque volume has been brought down from 4 per cent in 2014 to below 0.25 per cent in 2018 .
In view of the declining trend in the volume of such instruments presented in clearing , the frequency of separate sessions for clearing of non-CTS-2010 cheques in the three CTS grid centres has been reduced to once a fortnight from July 1 , 2018 ( every alternate Wednesday beginning July 4 , 2018 ) .
Banks have been advised to convert the existing post-dated cheques ( debit mandates ) to National Automated Clearing House ( NACH ) and not to accept additional post-dated cheques .
To realise the stated goals in the ' Payment and Settlement Systems in India : Vision 2018 ' document under the changing payments ecosystem in the country , a review of the policy framework for oversight of payment systems was undertaken .
The draft oversight framework for existing and new payment systems prescribing the intensity of oversight proportionate to systemic risks or system-wide risks posed by the participants of the payment system is being finalised .
As part of the off-site surveillance process , the PSOs periodically submit returns on the issuance and usage of payment instruments issued by them .
The periodic returns are being migrated to the eXtensible Business Reporting Language ( XBRL ) system to facilitate automated reporting from entities and provide better quality of information for decision-making .
During 2017-18 , onsite inspection of 21 entities , viz . , CCIL , NPCI , 18 PPI issuers and 1 WLA operator was carried out by the Bank .
In the NPCI inspection , special emphasis was laid on assessing the various risks ( i.e. , legal , operational , settlement and reputation ) and steps / measures are being put in place by NPCI for mitigating the same .
Issues related to governance and human resources were also covered during the inspection .
IX.16 Inspection of CCIL was undertaken in September 2017 .
As a measure of enhanced transparency , CCIL continued to disclose its self-assessment in compliance with the PFMIs on an annual basis , as per the ' Disclosure Framework and Assessment Methodology ' , prescribed in the PFMIs .
CCIL also published its quantitative disclosures on a quarterly basis as per the public disclosure standards for CCPs .
IX.17 In view of the increased threat of wholesale payments fraud , the CPMI established a task force to look into the security of wholesale payments and develop a strategy with the aim to encourage and help focus industry efforts to reduce the risk of wholesale payments fraud and support financial stability .
A gist of the elements of the strategy to reduce risks in wholesale payments relating to endpoint security is provided in ( Box IX.1 ) .
An endpoint in the wholesale payment ecosystem is defined to be a point in place and time at which payment instruction information is exchanged between two parties in the ecosystem .
Endpoint security aims to adequately secure every endpoint connecting to a network to block access attempts and other risky activity at these points of entry .
The CPMI has released a report titled , ' Reducing the Risk of Wholesale Payments Fraud Related to Endpoint Security ' in which it has stressed the need for a holistic approach to counter the risk of frauds .
The report highlighted the requirement for a coordinated effort to ensure the safety of wholesale payments that was essential due to the interconnectedness of the financial networks .
IX.18 The Bank held discussions with various stakeholders in the payments ecosphere to harmonise the CGRM across various products .
The proposed harmonisation will bring uniformity in various aspects , viz . , dispute redressal mechanism , cost structure , turn-around time for redressal of customer grievances and refund process for failed / rejected transactions .
The inputs so received are being examined and consolidated .
Meanwhile , a robust CGRM has been put in place for PPI issuers .
Element 3 : Promote adherence to the respective endpoint security requirements .
Element 4 : Provide and use information and tools to improve fraud prevention and detection .
Element 5 : Procedures and practices should be in place to respond to actual or suspected fraud in a timely manner .
Element 6 : Support ongoing education , awareness and information-sharing .
Element 7 : Monitor evolving endpoint security risks and risk controls , review and update the endpoint security requirements , procedures , practices and resources .
IX.20 The feature of sending positive confirmation to remitters regarding the completion of funds transfer is already live in the NEFT system and almost all banks are now sending the positive confirmation message to the remitter .
As envisaged in the ' Payment and Settlement Systems in India : System Vision 2018 ' document , the feature is being further strengthened by continuously monitoring the bank-wise percentage of positive confirmation messages sent .
The issue is also being taken up with banks having low percentage .
However , the data pertaining to the foreign leg of the payment transaction can be stored abroad as well .
IX.22 The second comprehensive Financial Sector Assessment Program ( FSAP ) , a joint programme of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the World Bank , was conducted for India in 2017 .
The assessment against the PFMIs concluded that CCIL systems observe or broadly observe 21 out of the 24 principles , with the remaining three principles being not applicable .
The report has been made public .
IX.23 To further widen the scope and to increase digital payments , various new features have been approved in UPI .
The major additional features include increasing the per transaction limit of an UPI transaction to ₹ 2.0 lakh from the existing limit of ₹ 1.0 lakh , allowing mandate with blocking of funds , overdraft account as an underlying account , processing of domestic leg of foreign inward remittance , and inclusion of State Cooperative Banks ( StCBs ) and District Central Cooperative Banks ( DCCBs ) as issuers , through sub-membership route .
Given the increasing role of payment gateways , the guidelines will be reviewed for the payment related activities of these entities .
IX.25 The Bank will examine the feasibility and timeline for implementation of the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) standard for messaging in NEFT .
IX.26 With the introduction of alternate modes of electronic payments for financial markets as also for businesses and individuals , the resiliency of the payment systems has gained importance .
Here , resiliency refers to the ability to continue to operate even if a system has failed completely by switching activity to a separate system or process or a combination of both .
A framework to test the resilience of both retail and large value systems in the country would be formulated .
IX.27 The Bank currently collects data on frauds from the PSOs .
In order to further strengthen the confidence in the payment systems and minimise instances of frauds , there is a need to monitor the types of frauds that may be taking place in various payment systems .
Accordingly , a comprehensive framework for collection of data on frauds in the payment systems would be drawn up in consultation with the industry .
IX.28 The Bank will engage with the stakeholders to conduct customer surveys on specific aspects of the payments systems to ascertain customer habits with respect to payment choices .
The same would help in framing regulatory framework and policies apart from empowering users through awareness intervention .
IX.29 The framework for limiting liability of customers in unauthorised electronic payment transactions in PPIs issued by banks is already in place .
The guidelines for enabling the same for PPIs issued by non-banks will be put in place during the year .
IX.30 The main focus of the Department of Information Technology ( DIT ) continued to be working towards ' service with security ' through the provision of robust technology infrastructure to ensure smooth functioning of the critical and systemically important payment and settlement systems in the country .
With the emerging threat landscape , where organised cyber-crime and cyber warfare are gaining prominence , the Department is working towards ensuring continuous protection against the changing contours of cyber security threat .
IX.31 The Reserve Bank ' s e-Kuber system has been assigned the responsibility of functioning as an ' aggregator ' for all-India collections under the Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) regime .
To develop it into a one-stop source of data reporting , server- to-server integration was established with central government , all the 36 state governments and union territories , 25 agency banks and GST Network ( GSTN ) ( Box IX.2 ) .
The standardised e-payment model , based on ISO 20022 messaging formats , envisages straight- through-processing ( STP ) of electronic payment instructions , sent by state governments through the interface with e-Kuber .
By end-March 2018 , 11 state governments , viz . , Andhra Pradesh , Assam , Bihar , Karnataka , Kerala , Odisha , Telangana , Tripura , Uttarakhand , Uttar Pradesh , and West Bengal have adopted this model to disburse payments electronically using e-Kuber .
During 2017-18 , an aggregate of ₹ 3.9 trillion was disbursed to 88.6 million beneficiaries by the state governments through e-Kuber as against ₹ 3.2 trillion to 74.3 million beneficiaries during 2016-17 .
By end-March 2018 , a total of 14 state governments , viz . , Andhra Pradesh , Bihar , Chhattisgarh , Gujarat , Karnataka , Kerala , Madhya Pradesh , Maharashtra , Odisha , Rajasthan , Tamil Nadu , Telangana , Uttarakhand and West Bengal , have adopted the e-receipt model .
The Sub-Committee on GST Payment Process , set up by the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers had recommended in April 2015 that the Reserve Bank ' s e-Kuber system could be designated as an all-India aggregator for GST collections .
The e-Kuber infrastructure has also been enhanced considerably for handling GST transactions .
As a result , the GST payers may now remit the tax directly to the government account / s maintained with the Reserve Bank , through their banks using NEFT and RTGS .
Under NEFT / RTGS mode , credit of tax to the government account happens directly on the same day , whereas in other modes of GST payments , the government account is credited on T + 1 basis .
Further , under the earlier tax collection system , only agency banks were authorised to collect taxes on behalf of governments , whereas under the new system , GST payers can remit the tax directly to the government account / s from their account in any bank ( including other than authorised agency banks ) .
IX.34 order to improve customers ' convenience and enhance the efficiency of the NEFT system , additional settlements at half-hour intervals were introduced , which took the total number of half hourly settlement batches to 23 .
The half hourly settlements had accelerated the funds transfer process and provided faster credit to the destination accounts .
On an average , about 18-19 percent of the GST collections , both in terms of value and volume , are received directly in government account through NEFT / RTGS payment modes , facilitating better cash management for the governments ( Chart 1 ) .
An online reconciliation mechanism for GST transactions , called Memorandum of Errors ( MoE ) , has been designed in coordination with the CBEC , Government of India .
This process is undergoing testing among all the stakeholders including the Reserve Bank , the GSTN , agency banks and CBEC .
The MoE process would facilitate paperless processing and resolution of reconciliation issues among the stakeholders with the Reserve Bank ' s e-Kuber system as the fulcrum .
The change in the NEFT application software for accommodating additional settlements was carried out in all the banks simultaneously without disrupting operations .
The RTGS recorded an all-time high of 0.91 million transactions on March 31 , 2018 as against 0.74 million in the previous year .
The NEFT registered 15.4 million transactions on March 31 , 2018 as against 12.5 million transactions last year , followed by the highest volume of 18.8 million so far on April 3 , 2018 .
IX.36 In order to ensure security of the Bank ' s IT infrastructure against rising cyber threats , an Information Security Operation Centre ( iSOC ) was made operational to monitor , detect , prevent and mitigate various types of information and cyber security risks .
The establishment of iSOC and its 24x7 vigil and monitoring resulted in the detection of attempts of cyber-attacks like unauthorised login , distributed denial of service ( DDoS ) , and traffic to / fro malicious command and control sites .
Vulnerability alerts received from various agencies were appropriately dealt with .
IX.37 IT infrastructure at the Bank ' s Data Centres was augmented to handle the increasing volumes of e-Kuber , NEFT and government transactions in a safe and secure environment .
Both hardware and software systems were upgraded to provide additional layers of security for IT operations .
IX.38 The department has been conducting awareness programmes across offices through awareness sessions , circulars / advisories and cyber security drills .
IX.39 The Integrated Computerised Currency Operations Management System ( ICCOMS ) , currently in use for currency management , will be migrated to the currency module of e-Kuber .
Presently , the pilot run of the currency module at the Bank ' s offices is underway .
The enhancement to e-Kuber would enable the Bank to have a near real-time view of the balances in the currency chests and facilitate efficient management of currency with the automation of processes .
The system would also have linkage with note printing presses and provision to track currency in transit .
IX.40 The next-generation currency management portal version 2.0 is under development and is expected to be launched with the currency management functionalities during 2018-19 .
The Memorandum of Errors ( MoE ) process is currently under test phase before deployment .
IX.42 A new enhanced ACMS including visitor and vendor management will be implemented at all offices of the Bank by integrating the Active Directory and SAMADHAN for attendance .
IX.43 The Bank will proactively initiate the process of developing a cyber-security culture , endeavour to make cyber security a responsibility and ensure confidentiality , integrity and availability of information system and resources .
The Reserve Bank , adopting various measures , strengthened its communication efforts further during the year which was also marked by the successful completion of the Financial Sector Assessment Programme ( FSAP ) .
Efforts were sustained towards improving research and statistics - both inside and outside the Reserve Bank - as also for providing better banking services to governments .
Foreign exchange reserves were managed and guided by the consideration of safety , liquidity and returns .
In order to ensure a robust legal framework for the banking and financial sector , a number of financial laws / bills were introduced / amended during the year .
X.1 This chapter discusses the developments and implementation status of the annual agenda in This chapter discusses the developments the areas of communication , international relations , research , statistics , forex reserves management , banking services to banks and governments , and financial laws during 2017-18 as also the respective agenda set for 2018-19 .
The channels of communication were strengthened during the year by the launch of ' Mint Street Memos ' , ( MSM ) , i.e. , researched-based online releases on contemporary economic and financial issues and research-based online releases on a public awareness programme through Short Message Service ( SMS ) followed by a 360 degree campaign .
During the year , research activities were sustained by undertaking studies in the area of monetary policy transmission , nowcasting , credit and efficiency in agriculture , rural wage dynamics , macroeconomic impacts of different types of public expenditure besides releasing various statutory and flagship publications .
As far as statistics and information management is concerned , the development of an employment index based on Tax Deducted at Source ( TDS ) data as well as salary account data and improvements in conduct of the surveys relating to monetary policy are underway apart from collection , processing and dissemination of national-level macroeconomic and financial statistics through various publications .
The year also witnessed a number of amendments / introduction of several legislations / bills pertaining to the RBI Act , the Banking Regulation Act and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code .
The Department of Communication ( DoC ) is the nodal department for the Bank ' s two-way communication with the public , which is performed mostly through announcements over the Reserve Bank ' s website as also by way of emails , speeches , public awareness messages , and tweets of important press releases and circulars .
It not only disseminates policy developments and their rationale to various stakeholders in a transparent , timely and credible manner but also strives to obtain continuous feedback on the policies .
The app has since been modified and more functionalities have been added like ' notifications ' , selective alerts and public awareness messages .
The app available for Android as well as iOS platforms from the Play Store / App Store witnessed 1,54,423 downloads on the Play Store and 13,135 downloads on the App Store till June 2018 .
The Reserve Bank ' s Twitter account has the 5th highest number of followers among central banks across the world ( over 3,47,000 followers ) and its YouTube channel has 18,409 subscribers , as on June 30 , 2018 .
The Governor ' s post-policy conference on the bi-monthly statements on monetary policy is disseminated through YouTube along with live streaming on the Reserve Bank ' s website and business television channels .
Apart from press conference , teleconferences with researchers and analysts are also conducted .
Each issue of MSM is published as a stand-alone release along with a press release .
These workshops were structured in the form of interactive sessions on central banking functions of relevance to the media with the aim that they would be better equipped in terms of understanding the functional areas and data reference points while reporting on these topics in future .
The Reserve Bank has a new communication window called to ' Mint Street Memos ' ( MSM ) since August 11 , 2017 .
MSM generally covers a brief write-up on a researched , contemporary topic contributed by the Reserve Bank and CAFRAL staff .
Relevant citations are given in the MSM , bringing out the significance of the study , along with salient facts , tables and figures germane to the issue at hand .
Although a one-way communication , MSM write-ups present a more structured and substantive expression of staff views on the topic at hand and its relevant takeaways .
The MSM have been well received by various strata of visitors to the Reserve Bank website as well as the media .
MSM No.2 : Financialisation of Savings into Non-Banking Financial Intermediaries .
The sessions were handled by senior officials / subject experts from the Reserve Bank .
The campaign started in November 2017 by way of an SMS cautioning public about fictitious offers purportedly sent out in the name of the Reserve Bank .
The SMS campaign also has a missed call element resulting in the service provider calling back to provide more information on the subject of SMS through a pre-recorded Interactive Voice Response System ( IVRS ) .
The television commercial spoke about opening of the Basic Savings Bank Deposit Accounts ( BSBDA ) which obviates the requirement of minimum balance in the bank account provided certain limitations on the account operation are acceptable to customers .
The television commercial , which featured the Reserve Bank ' s six cricketer employees became quite noticeable .
The message on BSBDA was also released in other media , viz . , print , other television channels , radio , digital and hoardings during May-June 2018 .
The first SMS regarding fictitious offers was broadcast to approximately 550 million mobile phone subscribers over a period of 12 days ( Table 1 ) .
The SMS campaign also has a missed call element where the subscriber can give a missed call on the Reserve Bank ' s short code number 14440 to receive a call back to get more information on the subject of the SMS .
After the SMS about registering complaints against fraudsters was sent , hits on the Reserve Bank ' s Sachet website peaked to 4,31,508 on a single day ( November 26 , 2017 ) as against a monthly average of approximately 1,000 hits on a regular day before the campaign ( Chart 1 ) .
The next three messages were broadcast to dispel rumours regarding ₹ 10 coins .
SMS 1 : Don ' t pay fees or charges to get large sums in return .
RBI Governor / RBI / Government never sends such email / SMS / call .
For more , give missed call to 8691960000 .
SMS 2 : If you receive offer of lottery winnings or cheap funds from RBl / Government body , complain on https : / / sachet.rbi.org.in / Complaints / Add .
Accept them without fear .
Give missed call to 14440 for more information .
To know more , give missed call to RBI at 14440 .
The advertisements were released in print media and are also being released in other media , viz ; other television channels , radio , digital and hoardings .
A separate link titled RBI Kehta Hai has been enabled on the RBI website for people who want to know more about the messages being broadcast on various media .
In the ensuing year , such media workshops will be conducted in a few other regional centres which have not been covered in the current year .
Certain features of the Reserve Bank website would be remodelled / modified and some new ones would be added on during the year , to make the website more robust and easy to navigate .
X.12 The RBI Museum is coming up at 8 , Council House Street , Kolkata , the building from where the Reserve Bank started its journey on April 01 , 1935 .
It is expected to complete the first phase of the Museum comprising ground and mezzanine floors during 2018-19 .
The Museum will offer visitors an opportunity to learn the fascinating story of money , gold , the Indian financial system and its genesis , and the role and functions of the Reserve Bank , narrated through artefacts and interactive exhibits .
As part of the public awareness campaign , a separate weblink is planned , which will have basic information on the Reserve Bank regulations useful to the common man .
Broadly , in terms of deliverables , the Unit ' s work involves short-term policy and operations , relevant research , and medium to long-term cutting-edge research projects with an aim to publish in top journals .
SRU closely monitors different sectors of the economy - both real and financial .
In this regard , it has initiated several studies in varied areas including the real sector , financial markets , capital formation , fiscal position and the external sector , which have been regularly presented in the MPC meetings .
Besides the regular surveillance and market intelligence related work , SRU also conducted a number of research studies that looked into issues relating to the Union Budget , spending quality of central and state governments , statutory liquidity ratio ( SLR ) requirements , limiting the exposure of foreign investment in Indian G-Secs , impact of goods and services tax ( GST ) on working capital constraints of firms , external vulnerability , investment in gold , the impact of minimum support prices on inflation , and impact of demonetisation on automated teller machine ( ATM ) and point of sale ( POS ) transactions .
These research studies were presented to the top management .
X.17 In addition , SRU is involved in long- term research relating to the heterogeneous effects of demonetisation on households , skill development and employment , fiscal austerity , bank recapitalisation in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium ( DSGE ) framework , trade and networks , and inflation dynamics .
Some of these studies have been presented in research conferences organised by both national and international institutions and published in academic journals .
SRU is also currently collaborating with CAFRAL and some external academic experts to build a customised DSGE model for India .
X.18 In the vein of future capacity building , SRU collaborates with other departments and CAFRAL for several research projects , inter-departmental research groups , some of which are also presented in the MPC meetings .
The unit also organises seminars regularly , jointly with CAFRAL , where eminent economists , professors , and experts in the fields of finance and economics are invited to present their research .
In addition , SRU and CAFRAL also organise brown-bag seminars , and lecture series , to encourage research projects .
X.19 With increasing emphasis on research , the Unit is expanding its domain of work with specialised economics and finance professionals and aims to create a cohort of well-trained employees with PhDs .
This will facilitate and encourage research in areas which are now defining the frontiers in economics and finance , with a broad objective of bridging the gap between core academic and policy research .
The Unit will broadly continue with the existing structure with an emphasis on research and knowledge dissemination .
It was also engaged in several bilateral and multilateral dialogues , focusing on central bank to central bank cooperation .
The International Department of the Bank played a key role in these activities including the coordination and completion of the Financial Sector Assessment Programme ( FSAP ) , undertaken once in five years .
X.21 The department coordinated with the government and participated in the meetings of various working groups of the G20 , such as the International Financial Architecture ( IFA ) , the Framework Working Group ( FWG ) and the Infrastructure Working Group ( IWG ) .
It also provided inputs for taking positions on the agenda before the G20 Deputies and the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors ( FMCBG ) meetings .
These meetings culminated in the G20 Hamburg Action Plan ( HAP ) under the German Presidency with a focus on using all policy tools - monetary , fiscal and structural - to achieve the goal of strong , sustainable , balanced and inclusive growth .
India ' s overall growth strategy , finalised by the government in collaboration with the Reserve Bank , was broadly endorsed in the G20-led International Monetary Fund ' s ( IMF ' s ) first pilot report on Strong , Sustainable , and Balanced Growth ( SSBG ) in October 2017 .
Also , a fruitful reference was made to the IMF ' s ' institutional view ' that allows flexibility in capital account management by the EMEs .
It also contributed to the survey-based G20 process reform initiative taken by the Argentina Presidency .
The G20 IFA is currently working on issues such as capital flows , debt sustainability of low-income countries ( LICs ) , balance sheet optimisation of Multilateral Development Banks ( MDBs ) and Global Financial Safety Net ( GFSN ) .
India through its interventions , also kept the 15th General Review of Quotas ( GRQ ) of the IMF on the IFA agenda .
Notably , India along with some other emerging markets , advocated for greater flexibility in the OECD Code currently under revision at the OECD Advisory Task Force ( ATFC ) and the IFA meetings .
The G20 FWG , for which India is a Co-Chair , focused on ' Future of Work ' as a new initiative and developed a menu of policy options to reap opportunities from new technologies and address challenges therefrom .
The G20 IWG is working on a multi- year roadmap towards developing infrastructure as an asset class by improving cross-country information availability and assessments of project rationale , appraisals , commercial viability , affordability , and deliverability .
X.23 The Reserve Bank also participated in Sustainable Finance Study Group as well as in two sub-groups dealing with Regulation and Standard Setting Body , and Financial Consumer Protection and Financial Literacy , under the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion .
In the recent period , adequate progress has not been made on the Quota Formula Review for the 15th GRQ of the IMF .
India , however , continued to pitch for progress on the 15th GRQ and its completion within the agreed timeline , including a new quota formula by the spring meetings of 2019 and no later than the annual meetings of 2019 .
This was strongly articulated in the Governor ' s statement at the International meeting in April 2018 .
In order to shoulder its responsibility towards adequate availability of Monetary and Financial Committee GFSN , the Reserve Bank signed a Note Purchase Agreement ( NPA ) with the IMF for US $ 10 billion as part of the 2016 borrowing agreements amounting to about SDR 316 billion ( US $ 450 billion ) from 40 IMF members .
This arrangement effectively extends IMF ' s access to bilateral borrowed resources until the end of 2019-20 .
X.25 The FSAP for India , conducted jointly by the IMF and the World Bank , was started with a scoping Mission in December 2016 and included two Mission visits - in March 2017 and in June-July 2017 .
Subsequently , the department coordinated the authorities responses to the draft and the final reports .
The affirmative nature of the report for India under the FSAP was the highlight of the year ( Box X.3 ) .
FSAP is a mandatory exercise conducted every five years for 29 jurisdictions , including India , which are identified to have systematically important financial sectors based on two parameters : ( i ) size of the financial sector and ( ii ) interconnectedness of the financial sector with the rest of the world .
The 2017 FSAP , the second such assessment conducted for India , observed that India has implemented almost all the recommendations of the FSAP 2011 , including the oversight of overseas operations of Indian banks and large exposure limits .
However , more work needs to be done on the resolution tools and arrangements to deal with a crisis .
The 2017 FSAP placed greater emphasis on interconnectedness ; expanded the range of coverage ; and took into account the potential for price contagion across financial sectors .
The assessment of the Basel Core Principles ( BCP ) was done in terms of the revised BCP that raised the bar for compliance in many ways .
The 2017 FSAP , nevertheless , reaffirmed India ' s high compliance with the international standards , testifying to a sound and vibrant financial system in India .
India was judged as fully or largely compliant with all the BCP principles , except two .
The material non-compliance was judged in the area of independence , accountability , resourcing and legal protection for supervisors , and on corporate governance in banks .
The former was mainly on account that the regulator does not have full discretion to take supervisory actions against the public sector banks ( PSBs ) , while the latter was due to very limited authority of the Reserve Bank to hold the PSB boards accountable and to replace weak and non-performing senior management and government- appointed board members .
The FSSA Report recognised the Reserve Bank ' s intensified efforts to strengthen bank balance sheets , enhance provisioning coverage , address current fragilities and ultimately improve banking soundness ; including ( i ) setting up of the Central Repository of Information on Large Credits ( CRILC ) that helps in tracking not just the NPAs , but incipient stress and inadequate recognition of bad loans ; ( ii ) the framework for revitalising distressed assets in the economy with a special focus on addressing coordination problems in large consortium accounts under the Joint Lenders Forums ( JLFs ) ; and ( iii ) using the revised prompt corrective framework to work towards needed improvements in weak banks .
The government took several legislative measures to facilitate faster recovery and resolution of stressed assets including the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code , 2016 ; amendments to the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest ( SARFAESI ) Act , 2002 and the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act , among others .
The Report recommended the recapitalisation and restructuring , consolidation , divestment and privatisation of the PSBs , and the need to improve their governance and financial operations .
The FSAP ' s stress tests suggested that capital needs of the PSBs were manageable aggregating between 0.75 per cent of GDP in the baseline and 1.5 per cent in the severe adverse scenario .
The authorities have not only been frequently assessing the capital needs but have clearly laid out plans for recapitalisation that are incentive compatible for reforms .
The government on October 24 , 2017 announced a PSB recapitalisation plan of ₹ 2.11 trillion ( about US $ 32 billion ) to be implemented over the next two years that include budgetary provisions of ₹ 181.39 billion , recapitalisation bonds of ₹ 1,350 billion and the balance through raising of capital by banks from the market while diluting government equity .
This effectively will address the capital gap assessed in the FSAP exercise .
Already , recapitalisation bonds of ₹ 800 billion have been issued .
However , there is pressing need to link the recapitalisation to first putting in place governance reforms , especially for the banks under the prompt corrective action ( PCA ) .
The financial sector oversight framework was assessed in terms of system-wide oversight and macro-prudential policies ; supervision and regulation of banking sector , insurance sector and security markets ; financial markets infrastructure oversight ; crisis management framework ; and market integrity .
As observed by the FSSA , inter-agency cooperation and information sharing on financial stability matters have improved markedly , since the establishment of the Financial Stability and Development Council ( FSDC ) in 2010 and the adoption of an inter-agency Memorandum of Understanding among the regulatory authorities in 2013 .
The Reserve Bank made substantial progress in strengthening banking supervision , especially with the introduction in 2013 of a risk-based supervision through a comprehensive and forward-looking Supervisory Programme for Assessment of Risk and Capital ( SPARC ) .
In April 2017 , the Reserve Bank established a new Enforcement Department with a view to speeding up regulatory compliance and revised its prompt corrective action framework to incorporate more prudent risk-tolerance thresholds .
On the banking sector , the FSAP recommended a review of loan classification and provisioning rules in the context of the International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) , and with respect to special loan categories .
The Reserve Bank is in the process of such a review in conjunction with the IFRS-9 , wherein expected loss framework forms the basis for provisions and all loans are covered by provisioning .
This framework will capture past loss data and recovery of non-performing loans .
At the same time , it needs to be recognised that in the Indian context , special category loans , which comprise loans primarily to agriculture , do not necessarily violate the prudence principles and , instead , reflect the inclusion criteria .
Moreover , the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ( BCBS ) guidelines issued in 2016 on prudential treatment of problem assets , provide for supervisory deviation from the 90-day norm and prescribe up to a 180-day norm in case of retail and public sector entities exposure if this is considered appropriate for local conditions .
To enable the Reserve Bank to be fully effective in exercising its supervisory mandate , the FSAP suggested that the legal framework should be amended to strengthen the Reserve Bank ' s powers over PSBs and its de jure independence .
The legal provisions to terminate tenures of the top functionaries or to supersede decisions of the Bank are just enabling provisions for extra-ordinary situations .
Regarding the recommendation on avoiding duplication of supervisory powers between the Reserve Bank and the Resolution Corporation ( RC ) , the matter is being looked at so that adequacy of inspection / supervisory powers with the RC is appropriately balanced with supervisory powers of the regulator without affecting the ability of RC to adequately prepare to resolve the financial service provider efficiently while at the same time ensuring that the regulator has adequate supervisory powers for the concern , enabling it to turn it around , inter-alia , through prompt corrective action .
The FSAP has called for improvement in the frameworks for emergency liquidity assistance ( ELA ) , deposit insurance , and crisis preparedness .
While there is no technical obstacle to extending ELA , the Reserve Bank has in place a carefully drafted Board-approved policy on ELA that incorporates constructive ambiguity and flexibility , and as such does not prefer more clarity than is necessary as it could engender moral hazard .
The Reserve Bank ' s regulation and oversight of the securities and derivatives clearing and settlement systems are broadly effective , according to the FSAP , with the Clearing Corporation of India Limited ( CCIL ) playing a critical role in all money market segments and acting as a Central Counterparty ( CCP ) for government securities , repo and secondary markets .
As for the Trade Repository ( TR ) , the operating regulations for TR services have since received the Bank ' s regulatory approval and the CCIL has notified the regulations , complying with the principle .
As for the FSAP view on transfer of ownership of the National Housing Bank to the government and regulation of housing finance companies to the Reserve Bank , it is already under consideration of the government .
The FSSA Report has called for progressively reducing the statutory liquidity ratio ( SLR ) to help deepen markets and encourage lending .
Accordingly , the SLR has been brought down in a consistent but gradual manner , and now stands at 19.5 per cent down from 23 per cent in January 2014 .
Furthermore , a total carve-out from SLR of 13 per cent of their NDTL is available to banks .
However , the authorities view is that a pre-announced calendar of reduction would preclude a consideration for market conditions , as is being currently undertaken .
On the Priority Sector Lending ( PSL ) norms , the FSAP has recommended a cost-benefit and gap diagnostic including a plan to reduce its scope and ensure its targets for underserved segments .
It is reiterated that the PSL programme plays an important role in providing credit to sectors which do not get easy access to formal finance and so facilitates inclusion , employment and growth .
IMF ( 2017 ) , " " India ' s 2017 Financial System Stability Assessment " , " IMF Country Report No.17 / 390 , December .
Two Detailed Assessments Reports ( DARs ) relating to ( i ) the Basel Core Principals ( BCP ) for Effective Banking Supervision and ( ii ) the CPMI-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures were also released in January 2018 by the IMF and the World Bank , respectively .
The latter provides an assessment of the Clearing Corporation of India Limited ( CCIL ) as a Central Counterparty ( CCP ) and Trade Repository ( TR ) .
In this regard , the department followed up and coordinated the work related to the implementation and impact of reforms in the OTC derivatives market in India .
X.27 The department prepared inputs for formulating India ' s stance on the issues deliberated in FSB meetings and conference calls which included assessment of macro-financial vulnerabilities , particularly emanating from weak domestic investment demand , shadow banking , cyber-risks and FinTech .
The department also contributed to the BCBS task force on financial technology innovations from the perspective of banks business models and the role of supervisors .
It provided inputs to several FSB surveys that included those on crypto assets and their financial stability implications , cyber security , regulatory and supervisory practices and the ongoing FSB work on reducing misconduct risks in the financial sector .
Further , in the context of correspondent banking relationships ( CBRs ) being under pressure globally , it was conveyed that in India , de-risking issues , leading to a decline in CBR services , were not observed significantly .
The exercise showed that the Monitoring Universe of Non- Bank Financial Intermediation ( MUNFI ) grew in 2016 at a marginally faster rate than in 2015 to an aggregate US $ 160 trillion ( i.e. , for 21 jurisdictions and the euro area as a whole ) .
MUNFI ' s share within the global financial assets increased for the fifth consecutive year to 48 per cent .
The reserve bank continued its engagement with the various Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) working groups during the year and deliberations were held on a multitude of topical issues such as globalisation , Big Data , central bank digital currency , snapbacks from the unwinding of the Fed balance sheet and risk weight on sovereign assets .
The Reserve Bank is also represented on the Committee on the Global Financial System ( CGFS ) , which has set up various working groups on issues such as structural changes in the banking sector post the global financial crisis , implications of a prolonged period of low interest rates and establishing viable capital markets .
The Reserve Bank is represented on these working groups as well .
The department is overseeing the initial preparations for setting up of the BBF .
Furthermore , it has been working to keep the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement ( CRA ) in operational readiness and building upon a system of macroeconomic exchange of information amongst CRA members covering 60 economic and financial indicators that was developed by the Reserve Bank as part of surveillance under the BRICS CRA .
The fourth seminar on SAARCFINANCE database and the second meeting of the working group on SAARCFINANCE database were organised during March 22-23 , 2018 at the Jaipur Office of the Reserve Bank , with a view to standardising and enhancing the coverage of data in the SAARCFINANCE database , maintained by the Reserve Bank .
Under the SAARCFINANCE roadmap of cooperation , technical support and exposure were provided to member central banks on areas of supervision , monetary policy , currency management , banking regulation , financial markets , financial inclusion and library management .
These apart , liquidity support was provided to some central banks under the SAARC swap arrangement .
The extension framework of the swap arrangement for the SAARC countries was also finalised during the year with some modifications in order to avoid repeated recourse to swaps in keeping with the spirit of a backstop liquidity to meet temporary balance of payment needs .
The scheme is now extended for a period of two years till March 16 , 2019 .
During the year , a major achievement due to the Reserve Bank ' s intervention was the decision to remit pension to Nepalese pensioners , residing in Nepal , following the Employees Provident Fund Organisation ' s ( EPFO ) concurrence in consultation with select PSBs that have subsidiaries in Nepal .
These groups worked on issues such as : ( i ) Basel III implementation in India and finalisation of remaining elements thereof ; ( ii ) FinTech and digital innovation and their financial stability implications ( including virtual currencies ) with special reference to India ; ( iii ) resolution and deposit insurance framework for financial firms in India ( as envisaged in terms of the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill ) with the objective of benchmarking against the FSB ' s key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes ; ( iv ) effects of the post-crisis global financial regulatory reforms ( as implemented by the FSB for more resilient financial system ) and their intended and unintended consequences in India ; ( v ) elements of Global OTC Derivative Reforms since the global financial crisis , regulatory compliance and their broader effects on OTC derivative market in India in terms of parameters like legal barriers to reporting and accessing trade data , margining requirements , etc. and ( vi ) institutionalising macro-prudential framework in India for securing financial stability .
The groups have worked on the positions that India may take on these issues with respect to the agenda of the international organisations .
In addition , during 2017-18 , the department organised 41 exposure visits including attachments for capacity building for foreign central banks / regulatory authorities / ministries and foreign universities of repute .
Talks by national and international experts were also organised under Mimamsa - the department ' s discussion forum .
The Reserve Bank continued its support towards South Asia Regional Training and Technical Assistance Center ( SARTTAC ) and international groupings such as G24 and G30 .
It will continue to pitch for completion of the 15th GRQ in a timely manner with realignment of quota shares of the emerging market and developing economies whose under-representation has been increasing .
It will also work towards successful completion of the IMF ' s Article IV 2018 Mission that visited India during May 2018 .
Stabilising and further expansion of the SAARCFINANCE database initiative will be undertaken through the next seminar and meeting of the working group on the SAARCFINANCE database .
The agenda under the SAARCFINANCE roadmap will be furthered with capacity building , technical support , collaborative studies and database initiatives .
It will also be working towards strengthening the macroeconomic exchange of information to enhance the surveillance capacity of BRICS CRA .
Also , BRICS CRA test runs will be conducted during the year to check the operational readiness of the CRA arrangements .
The department will continue to provide reliable , thorough and research-based policy briefs , notes and interventions on issues being discussed at various international fora .
X.40 The Department of Government and Bank Accounts ( DGBA ) oversees the functions of the Reserve Bank as banker to banks and banker to government , besides formulating internal accounting policies of the Bank .
The department monitored the implementation of the GST framework , which was successfully stabilised during the year .
Mumbai Regional Office was designated as the nodal office to attend to GST related issues .
On the issue of integration of state governments with the Reserve Bank ' s e-Kuber , 14 state governments for e-receipts and 11 state governments for e-payments have been integrated so far with e-Kuber .
Further , government banking divisions have been opened in seven Regional Offices which will help integrate the state government treasury systems with the Reserve Bank ' s e-Kuber for e-receipts and e-payments besides addressing specific needs of the state governments ( Box X.4 ) .
At the same time , various other state governments are in different levels of technological preparedness .
With the introduction of Cheque Truncation System ( CTS ) , the need for physical movement of cheques from the presenting bank to the paying bank has been eliminated , as cheques are paid on the basis of cheque images .
The process put in place for such exchange of physical cheques is called P2F ( Paper to Follow ) .
In case of central government cheques , the P2F process has been discontinued , effective February 2016 .
As all state governments are yet to give their consent for discontinuation of P2F arrangement in cheque clearing , efforts are underway to identify technical solution for discontinuation of P2F for specific state governments .
Discontinuation of P2F arrangements for cheque clearing , in phases for state governments , will be taken up through technological solutions .
The department would examine the feasibility of the implementation of the recommendations of the Committee on Cost of Government Banking ( Chairman : Shri S. Ganesh Kumar ) , 2018 and the Working Group on Business Process Re- engineering of Government Banking ( Chairman : Shri G. Sreekumar ) , 2017 .
The Reserve Bank is acting as the principal banker to various state governments as per the provisions of Section 21A of the RBI Act , 1934 .
Accordingly , Government Banking Divisions ( GBDs ) at 18 Reserve Bank Offices had been rendering the function as banker to the state governments .
In furtherance of this objective and also for providing better service to the needs of state governments at the local level , it was decided to open GBDs at the Reserve Bank Offices in state capitals not having GBDs .
These GBDs also facilitate meeting the specific needs of state governments due to proximity by being in the state capitals .
Further , these GBDs also play a crucial role in integrating the state government treasury systems with the Reserve Bank ' s e-Kuber for e-receipts and e-payments .
During the year under review , FER increased by 5.0 per cent by June 2018 over June 2017 , as compared to 6.3 per cent witnessed in the corresponding period of the previous year .
Diversification of India ' s Foreign Currency Assets ( FCA ) continued during the year with attention being ascribed to risk management , including cyber security risk .
A comprehensive review of the credit risk policy was carried out during the year and the credit risk monitoring mechanism was strengthened .
A number of proactive and preventive measures were taken to ensure the efficacy of the extant IT security system .
The agenda for 2018-19 includes taking effective steps to further enhance the levels of protection against cyber risks , system development for undertaking interest rate futures transactions and entering into repo transactions to enhance returns .
A knowledge centre for macroeconomic policy oriented research , the Department of Economic and Policy Research ( DEPR ) of the Reserve Bank is entrusted with the task of providing research inputs and management information system services for policy-related decision making .
The department ' s contributions are multi-dimensional .
Apart from being a source of important primary national level data , DEPR is also responsible for the Reserve Bank ' s statutory reports and frontline research publications , as also the Bank ' s collaboration with external experts on policy-oriented research .
During the year , the department brought out the flagship publications of the Reserve Bank , viz . , the Annual Report , Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India , Reserve Bank of India Bulletin , and the third edition of the Handbook of Statistics on Indian States .

The third edition of the Handbook of Statistics on Indian States , that provides a wealth of data on the regional economy was also released at the conference .
Going forward , apart from the usual statutory and non-statutory publications , and compilation and dissemination of data , some policy-oriented macroeconomic and monetary policy issues have been identified for focused analysis and research during 2018-19 .
They include : transmission of monetary policy , credit growth and banking sector health , impact of loan loss provisions on bank credit , non-banking financial institution ' s financial performance , changing dynamics in monetary aggregates , fiscal policy and financial markets , relationship between implied volatility indices ( VIX ) and stock price indices , global liquidity and FII flows , impact of farm credit on investment and performance of priority sector lending , big-data study based on night-time luminosity as a supplementary measure of economic activities in India , effectiveness of trade policy measures in managing food inflation in India , minimum support prices and food inflation , impact of demographic changes on the macroeconomic outlook of India , and crypto currency and its challenges for central banks .

The department will continue to organise a number of seminars and lectures during 2018-19 .
In pursuit of these objectives , DSIM maintains a centralised database for the Reserve Bank , manages the centralised submission of returns through the eXtensible Business Reporting Language ( XBRL ) system and provides a range of information management related support services .
During the year , the department brought out its regular publications , viz . , Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy , 2016-17 ; Statistical Tables Relating to Banks in India 2016- 17 ; Basic Statistical Returns of SCBs in India : March 2017 ; Composition and Ownership Pattern of Deposits : March 2017 ; Quarterly BSR-1 : Outstanding Credit of SCBs upto December 2017 and Quarterly Statistics on Deposits and Credit of SCBs ( BSR-7 ) upto March 2018 .
The Weekly Statistical Supplement ( WSS ) and the ' Current Statistics ' portion of the RBI Bulletin were generated from the Database on Indian Economy ( DBIE ) , as per the prescribed frequency .
Under the guidance of the Technical Advisory Committee on Surveys ( TACS ) , several improvements were considered in the conduct of surveys relating to monetary policy .
Important among them were extending the coverage of the Consumer Confidence Survey ( CCS ) to seven more cities , finalising probability based sampling design for the Inflation Expectation Survey of Households ( IESH ) and revising the method for estimation of Capacity Utilisation ( CU ) for the manufacturing sector based on the Order Books , Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey ( OBICUS ) data .
Unit level data of the IESH and CCS were released in the public domain to promote research .
Besides the payment systems data , data on Tax Deducted at Source ( TDS ) , based on returns filed by the employers to income tax authorities , and salary account data of banks are also being explored for development of an employment index .
During the year , the risk profile of the listed non-government non-financial companies was analysed based on suitably chosen stress scenarios .
The Group has provided a blue print for the proposed Centralised Information Management System ( CIMS ) .
Based on the same , a Technical Advisory Group ( TAG ) with three sub groups , viz . , i ) Data Governance Sub-Group ( DGS ) ; ii ) Subject Matter Expert ( SME ) Sub-Group ; and iii ) Data Analytics Sub-Group ( DAS ) have been formed for preparation of the project .
The CIMS will include Big Data platform , centralised analytics with metadata repository and state of the art data visualisation tools .
The Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing ( VA-PT ) of the Hadoop system for analysing transaction-level payment system data from National Electronic Funds Transfer ( NEFT ) and National Automated Clearing House ( NACH ) was carried out during the year .

The HTF engaged actively with all major stakeholders to understand the state of the credit information reporting system in India and identify the gaps in the same .
The report presents an outline of the proposed PCR in terms of structure , governance and technological framework .
The Reserve Bank considered the recommendations of the HTF and decided that a PCR would be set up by the Bank in a modular and phased manner .
The report of the HTF was made available for public on the Bank ' s website on June 06 , 2018 .
The Committee in its report submitted in May 2018 made wide ranging recommendations for improving the system of FoF compilation in India in line with the prescriptions of the G20 Data Gap Initiatives .

Keeping in mind the increasingly important role being played by social media , a suitable policy regarding the use of social media by staff members has been put in place .
Introducing a mid-career mandatory training programme for officers in select grades is envisaged .
A well-defined policy on succession planning is also being formulated .
With a view to developing an integrated assessment and management of the risks faced by the Reserve Bank in accordance with its articulated risk policies , an enterprise-wide risk management ( ERM ) framework was adopted in February 2012 , marking a move from a ' silo based ' approach to a ' whole-of-business ' perspective to risk management in the Reserve Bank .
A historical analysis of the Reserve Bank ' s economic capital ( EC ) levels suggested a discernible cyclical trend in the Bank ' s EC on account of volatility in market forces .
The volatility in the valuation buffers is on account of not only market dynamics but also the Bank ' s public policy objectives , which necessitate maintaining , inter alia , a very large open forex position .
With a view , therefore , towards reducing the impact of cyclicality , while putting in place a rule-based methodology for determining the provisioning requirements and consequently , the available transferable surplus to the Government of India , an alternative rule based approach , viz . , the Staggered Surplus Distribution Policy ( SSDP ) has been put in place ( Box XI.1 ) .
It is in the public interest that a central bank should continue to perform its public policy functions effectively even during times of extreme stress .
A central bank , therefore , requires a minimum level of confidence regarding its financial strength and the resources at its disposal which will allow it to effectively discharge its functions even during crises .
The surplus distribution policy adopted by a central bank is one of the key elements that can determine its financial strength .
The same approach for surplus distribution cannot be applied across central banks considering the varied political and economic environment under which they operate .
Other considerations which necessitate different distribution policies are the varying levels of risk exposures of the central banks as well as the availability of risk transfer mechanisms between the central banks and their stakeholders .
The risk transfer mechanism may also not be effective if a particular stakeholder ' s finances are also under stress during a crisis .
The preparation of RRs for each BA of the Reserve Bank is almost over , and upon finalisation of all of them , a composite view of the risk profile of the entire Bank would be available .
A few central banks also follow accelerated surplus retention based on a target level of provisions in case where the target is not met .
Surplus smoothening wherein it is ensured that regular surplus may be transferred to the government and that the surplus transfer is not affected by the cyclicality of the provisions of the central bank .
The provisioning requirements of a central bank should be linked to a target level of financial resilience to be achieved / maintained .
In the case of central banks where the distribution arrangements result in continuous substantial transfers without considering the overall level of provisions and risk transfer mechanisms , the financial strength of the central bank may progressively weaken .
Further , if a central bank maintains unrealised valuation gains on its balance sheet , these are predominantly taken as non-distributable .
The distribution policy should also bring about smoothening of surplus transfer to the government .
The four major components of the Risk Tolerance Framework ( RTF ) are : a ) articulation of risk tolerance statement , b ) review of risk tolerance limits , c ) implementation of integrated risk reporting framework , and d ) reviewing roles and responsibilities under the RTF .
The other three components are being implemented for creating a consistent , comprehensive and integrated risk framework .
The development of a computerised web-based risk monitoring software which is being taken up during the year will greatly strengthen this process .
Internal audit / inspection exercises undertaken by the Inspection Department of the Reserve Bank provide risk assurance to the top management and the Central Board .
The inspections are conducted under the Risk Based Internal Audit ( RBIA ) framework in which internal control and governance processes are examined .
The Inspection Department is also the Secretariat to the Audit and Risk Management Sub-Committee ( ARMS ) of the Central Board as also to the Executive Directors ' Committee ( EDC ) overseeing the internal audit function .
The automation of the audit process commenced with the roll out of the RBIA module in AMRMS in July 2017 , which is running successfully across all offices of the Bank .
The RBIA compliance module for all the auditee offices was also successfully implemented and went live in August 2017 .
The automation of the RBIA process has facilitated convergence of risk rating as per the Risk Assessment Methodology - Operational Risk ( RAM-OR ) and the Inspection Department ' s methodology to a greater extent .
During the year , the user training of all auditee offices in North , South , East and Western Zone was successfully completed .
The audit report of the Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing ( VA-PT ) / Technology Audit of Data Centres and CBS Application ( including e-Treasury module ) which was conducted in 2016 was closed and the Compliance Audit of the same was carried out to examine the sustenance of the action taken by the Business Owner Department with regard to the audit observations ( Box XI.2 ) .
VA-PT / Technology Audit of select critical IT applications would also be carried out , as required .
Thereupon , completion status of action points is assessed as at the end of each quarter to ensure that the action is completed in a time-bound manner .
The Department also formulates the annual budget of the Reserve Bank by adopting activity based budgeting , taking into account the annual action plans of the business units in the context of priorities and timelines .
The expenditure by the business units is also reviewed every quarter to ensure budget discipline .
The department has devised and set up robust BCPs with a view to creating a resilient framework for managing disruptions efficiently .
The Inspection Department carries two types of audits in the information systems area in the Bank to provide IT risk assurance .
First , the Information Systems ( IS ) audit is carried out by internal resources as part of the RBIA framework to evaluate risk control measures in Information Systems as per the IS Policy of the Bank .
The scope of the IS audit is limited mostly to audit observations around the IT systems and does not cover in detail the various vulnerabilities in terms of network , operating systems ( OS ) , database or application functionalities .
Secondly , to address the latter issues the department also carries out Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing ( VA-PT ) and Technology Audit of IT applications , operating systems , database , network resources , etc. to achieve a complete vulnerability analysis of these systems running in the bank .
VA-PT identifies the vulnerabilities which are present that can be exploited by the external or internal hackers to cause damage to the Bank ' s IT assets .
Penetration tests attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities in a system to determine whether unauthorised access or other malicious activity is possible and identify flaws that pose a threat to the application .
Penetration tests find exploitable flaws and measure the severity of such flaws / breaches .
The department had prepared Business Continuity Management ( BCM ) policy of the Bank , which was approved by the Central Board .
The Bank generally outsources the conduct of VA-PT to an external audit firm from the Bank empanelled ( CERT- In enlisted ) list of audit firms to identify and classify vulnerabilities , which enables the IT security team of the Bank to focus on mitigating critical vulnerabilities .
The VA-PT of network resources , OS and databases at data centres were earlier carried out .
The exercise assessed the overall health of the IS security at RBI in terms of network security , physical and logical access control , servers , OS and database security .
Identifying and addressing the vulnerabilities of the critical applications provides IT risk assurance to the Bank .
During 2016-17 , VA-PT of Video Conferencing System and NG-RTGS System were also carried out to identify and address the vulnerabilities , if any , associated with both the systems .
After the closure of the Audit Report of VA-PT / Technology Audit of Data Centres , Compliance Audit of the same was carried out during May 2018 to evaluate and get an assurance about the quality , adequacy and sustenance of the compliance .
During 2018-19 , the department would continue to carry out VA-PT of important IT assets covering critical IT applications , OS , databases , network resources , etc. of the Bank .
The department , besides organising the meetings of the governing boards of the external funded institutions ( EFls ) , viz . , IGIDR , CAFRAL , NIBM and IIBM and their sub-committees , had also actively participated in the reconstitution of the Governing Board of the NIBM .

The Reserve Bank was constituted as a private shareholders bank in 1935 with an initial paid-up capital of ₹ 0.05 billion .
The original Reserve Fund of ₹ 0.05 billion was created in terms of section 46 of the RBI Act , 1934 as contribution from the Central Government for the currency liability of the then sovereign government taken over by the Reserve Bank .
Thereafter , an amount of ₹ 64.95 billion was credited to this fund from out of gains on periodic revaluation of gold up to October 1990 , taking it to ₹ 65 billion .
The fund has been static since then as the unrealised gain / loss on account of valuation of gold and foreign currency is since being booked in the Currency and Gold Revaluation Account ( CGRA ) which appears under ' Other Liabilities and Provisions ' .
This includes National Industrial Credit ( Long Term Operations ) Fund and National Housing Credit ( Long Term Operations ) Fund .
This fund was created in July 1964 , under section 46C of the RBI Act , 1934 with an initial corpus of ₹ 100 million .
The fund witnessed annual contributions from the Reserve Bank for financial assistance to eligible financial institutions .
Since 1992-93 , a token amount of ₹ 10 million is being contributed each year to the Fund from the Bank ' s income .
This fund was set up in January 1989 under section 46D of the RBI Act , 1934 for extending financial accommodation to the National Housing Bank .
The initial corpus of ₹ 500 million has been enhanced by annual contributions from the Reserve Bank thereafter .
From 1992-93 , only a token amount of ₹ 10 million is being contributed each year from the Bank ' s income .
The balance in the fund stood at ₹ 2.01 billion as on June 30 , 2018 .
There are two other Funds constituted under section 46A of the RBI Act , 1934 viz . , National Rural Credit ( Long Term Operations ) Fund and National Rural Credit ( Stabilisation ) Fund which are maintained by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development ( NABARD ) for which a token amount of ₹ 10 million each is set aside and transferred to NABARD every year .
These represent the balances maintained with the Reserve Bank , by banks , the Central and State Governments , All India Financial Institutions , such as , Export Import Bank ( EXIM Bank ) , NABARD etc . , Foreign Central Banks , International Financial Institutions , balances in Employees Provident Fund , Depositor Education and Awareness Fund ( DEA Fund ) , amount outstanding against Reverse Repo , Medical Assistance Fund ( MAF ) etc .
Total deposits decreased by 27.19 per cent from ₹ 8,963.48 billion as on June 30 , 2017 to ₹ 6,525.97 billion as on June 30 , 2018 .
The Reserve Bank acts as banker to the Central Government in terms of sections 20 and 21 and as banker to the State Governments by mutual agreement in terms of section 21A of the RBI Act , 1934 .
Accordingly , the Central and the State Governments maintain deposits with the Reserve Bank .
The balances held by the Central and State Governments was ₹ 1.01 billion and ₹ 0.42 billion respectively as as compared to ₹ 947.74 billion and ₹ 0.43 billion respectively and totalling to ₹ 948.17 billion as on June 30 , 2017 .
The decrease in Central Government deposit is on account of redemption of Market Stabilisation Scheme ( MSS ) securities .
Banks maintain balances in their current accounts with the Reserve Bank to provide for the Cash Reserve Ratio ( CRR ) requirements and for working funds to meet payment and settlement obligations .
The deposits held by banks was ₹ 5,070.95 billion as on June 30 , 2018 as compared to ₹ 5,041.50 billion as on June 30 , 2017 .

The major components of ' Other Liabilities and Provisions ' are provisions and valuation heads .
While Contingency Fund ( CF ) and Asset Development Fund ( ADF ) represent provisions made for unforeseen contingencies and amount set aside for investment in subsidiaries and internal capital expenditure respectively , the remaining components of ' Other Liabilities and Provisions ' , such as , Currency and Gold Revaluation Account ( CGRA ) , Investment Revaluation Account ( IRA ) and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts Valuation Account ( FCVA ) , represent unrealised marked to market gains / losses .
This is specific provision meant for meeting unexpected and unforeseen contingencies , including depreciation in the value of securities , risks arising out of monetary / exchange rate policy operations , systemic risks and any risk arising on account of the special responsibilities enjoined upon the Bank .
It represents provision specifically made to make investments in subsidiaries and associate institutions and meet internal capital expenditure .
No provision was made for transferring to ADF in the year 2017-18 .
The balance in ADF remains as ₹ 228.11 billion as on June 30 , 2018 .
The major sources of market risk faced by the Reserve Bank are currency risk , interest rate risk and movement in gold prices .
Unrealised gains / losses on valuation of Foreign Currency Assets ( FCA ) and Gold are not taken to the Income Account but instead recorded in the CGRA .
Net balance in CGRA , therefore , varies with the size of the asset base , its valuation , and movement in the exchange rate and price of gold .
CGRA provides a buffer against exchange rate / gold price fluctuations .
It can come under pressure if there is an appreciation of the rupee vis-a-vis major currencies or a fall in the price of gold .
When CGRA is not sufficient to fully meet exchange losses , it is replenished from the contingency fund .
During 2017-18 , the balance in CGRA increased by 30.51 per cent from ₹ 5,299.45 billion as on June 30 , 2017 to ₹ 6,916.41 billon as on June 30 , 2018 mainly due to depreciation of rupee against US dollar and rise in the international price of Gold .
The foreign dated securities are marked to market on the last business day of each month and the unrealised gains / losses arising therefrom are transferred to the IRA-FS .
Accordingly , the balance in IRA-FS is NIL as on June 30 , 2018 .
Rupee securities and oil bonds ( with exception as mentioned under Significant Accounting Policy ) held as assets of the Banking Department are marked to market as on the last business day of each month and the unrealised gains / losses arising therefrom are booked in the Investment Revaluation Account- Rupee Securities ( IRA-RS ) .
Marking to market of outstanding forward contracts as on June 30 , 2018 resulted in a net gain of ₹ 32.62 billion , which was credited to the FCVA with contra debit to the Revaluation of Forward Contracts Account ( RFCA ) .
As per the extant policy , the amounts recorded in these accounts will be reversed on the maturity of the contracts .
Provision for payables decreased by 28.82 per cent from ₹ 39.17 billion in 2016-17 to ₹ 27.88 billion in 2017-18 .
Under Section 47 of the Reserve Bank of India Act , 1934 after making provisions for bad and doubtful debts , depreciation in assets , contribution to staff and superannuation funds and for all matters for which provisions are to be made by or under the Act or that are usually provided by bankers , the balance of the profits of the Bank is required to be paid to the Central Government .
Under Section 48 of the RBI Act , 1934 , the Bank is not liable to pay income tax or super tax on any of its income , profits or gains .
Accordingly , after adjusting the expenditure , provision for CF and contribution of ₹ 0.04 billion to the statutory funds , the surplus transferable to the Government of India for the year 2017-18 amounted to ₹ 500 billion ( including ₹ 8.49 billion as against ₹ 9.93 billion in the previous year payable towards the difference in interest expenditure borne by the Government , consequent on conversion of special securities into marketable securities ) .

The balance under this head increased by 587.89 per cent from ₹ 18.74 billion as on June 30 , 2017 to ₹ 128.91 billion as on June 30 , 2018 .
The increase was mainly on account of transfer of ₹ 107.20 billion to ' Other Liabilities and Provisions ' representing the value of Specified Bank Notes ( SBNs ) which have not been paid and were part of liability head ' Notes issued ' .
Section 34 ( 1 ) of the RBI Act , 1934 requires that all bank notes issued by the Reserve Bank since April 1 , 1935 and the currency notes issued by the Government of India before the commencement of operations of the Reserve Bank , be part of the liabilities of the Issue Department .
SBNs were received by the Reserve Bank either directly or from bank branches / post offices through the currency chest mechanism .
Verification and processing of the SBNs has been completed .
The total value of SBNs returned from circulation is ₹ 15,310.73 billion .

The income from foreign sources , increased by 47.43 per cent from ₹ 185.86 billion in 2016-17 to ₹ 274.01 billion in 2017-18 mainly on account of the general rise in yield / interest rates across all currencies .
The income from domestic sources increased by 17.69 per cent from ₹ 432.32 billion in 2016-17 to ₹ 508.80 billion in 2017-18 mainly on account of lower net interest outgo under LAF / MSF operations consequent to lower surplus liquidity in the banking system as compared to 2016-17 ( Table XII.9 ) .
The coupon income decreased on account of decrease in the RBI ' s holding of Government securities as a result of net OMO sale of ₹ 681.05 billion in 2017-18 .
The increase in net interest income from LAF / MSF operations was due to lower interest outgo under reverse repo in 2017-18 consequent to lower surplus liquidity in the banking system .

The decrease was mainly due to net impact of decrease in Bank ' s contribution towards various superannuation funds and marginal increase in pay revision .
Till 2016-17 , the item ' Turnover commission paid to banks on relief bonds / savings bond ' was included in sub head ' Agency commission on Government transactions ' .
The Reserve Bank pays commission to these agency banks at prescribed rates which were last revised with effects from July 01 , 2012 .
The decrease may be attributed to migration of government transactions to electronic mode , especially in the light of implementation of GST framework with effect from July 1,2017 and integration of Goverment systems with RBI ' s e-Kuber for direct processing of government payments and receipts .
The Reserve Bank paid total underwriting commission of ₹ 1.13 billion during 2017-18 as compared to ₹ 0.53 billion during 2016-17 .

The decrease was mainly on account of reduced supply of notes during the year 2017-18 at 25,003 million pieces which was 14 per cent lower than that of the previous year ' s supply of 29,043 million pieces .
This is primarily because of increase in depreciation on fixed assets during 2017-18 .
The balances are callable at three months notice by a decision of the BIS Board of Directors .
The prior period transactions under expenditure and income amounted to ₹ 0.90 billion and ₹ 0.15 billion respectively .

Vijayaraghavan & Co . , Chennai and M / s Mehra Goel & Co . , New Delhi as Statutory Branch Auditors .
The decline in exports of readymade garments was conditioned by issues related to delays in reversal of input tax credit , particularly on man-made fabrics , and the imposition of a value added tax ( VAT ) by the UAE , which is the second largest export destination for Indian readymade garments .
Despite a moderation in export growth , India was able to maintain its share in global exports at 1.7 per cent in 2018 and the exports at US $ 330.1 billion reached their highest ever level ( the previous high of US $ 314.4 billion in 2013-14 ) .
The sectors which witnessed robust export growth in 2018- 19 included organic chemicals and electronic goods .
Merchandise imports which had been growing in double digits during H1 : 2018-19 slowed down during H2 and grew at 10.6 per cent for the year as a whole during 2018-19 , a marked deceleration from 20.9 per cent growth in the previous year ( Table II.6.1 ) .
The moderation in imports occurred despite petroleum imports rising by 29.7 per cent on the back of a 23.5 per cent ( y-o-y ) increase in international crude oil prices and a modest increase in import volume .
With major oil producers ( OPEC and major non-OPEC ) recommitting to production cuts of about 1.8 million barrels per day through 2017 and 2018 and with improved compliance , crude oil prices rose sharply from US $ 54.5 per barrel in September 2017 to US $ 80.1 per barrel in October 2018 .
Effective exchange rates ( EER ) , both nominal and real , are widely used indicators of international price and cost competitiveness .
Double weights schemes are employed to take into account both direct and third-market export competition ( Turner and Van ' t dack , 1993 ) .
For India , the largest third-market competitor is China ( apparel , textile fabrics , footwear and musical instruments ) , followed by the euro area which is the largest export competitor of India in manufactured goods ( Chart 1 ) .
Nevertheless , EERs based on double-weighting are more representative of international competitiveness than single-weighting schemes .
Merchandise import growth was also pulled down by a decline in gold imports brought about by a fall in international gold prices in spite of somewhat higher volume of imports than a year ago .
Growth in non-oil non-gold imports slowed considerably during 2018-19 , indicative of a weakening domestic demand ( Chart II.6.4 ) .
Within non-oil non-gold imports , contraction in imports of vegetable oils , pulses , and pearls and precious stones and pronounced Chart II.6.4 : Merchandise Import Growth : - - Merchandise Imports ( per cent ) Source : DGCI & S.
Tariff escalations and stricter rules of origin policies triggered a decline of 15.0 per cent in vegetable oil imports during 2018-19 .
Telecom instruments , comprising mobile phones and parts of mobile phones among other components , recorded a decline during 2018-19 ( Chart II.6.5 ) .
This coincided with an increase in the domestic production of mobile phones , the impetus to which was provided by the government ' s Phased Manufacturing Programme , announced in the Union Budget 2015-16 ( Box II.6.2 ) .
These developments resulted in a widening of the trade deficit to US $ 184.0 billion in 2018-19 ( 6.8 per cent of GDP ) from US $ 161.3 billion ( 6.1 per cent of GDP ) in the previous year .
Terms of trade losses augmented the trade deficit by US $ 7.1 billion .
On a bilateral basis , a notable development is the reduction in India ' s trade deficit with China and Indonesia , even as India ' s trade surplus with the US shrank as India ' s imports from the US grew much faster than India ' s exports to the US ( Chart 11.6.6 ) .
Petroleum products and diamonds accounted for most of the increase in India ' s imports from the US during 2018-19 .
Net receipts from invisibles , comprising services , income and transfers , recorded double digit growth during 2018-19 .
Concomitantly , it has emerged as a significant engine of cross-border trade .
The Union Budget 2015-16 introduced the Phased Manufacturing Programme ( PMP ) for mobile handsets and related sub-assemblies / components manufacturing , involving a countervailing duty on mobile phone imports , a differential excise duty structure for domestic mobile phone manufacturing and exemption of parts / components / accessories of mobile phones from basic customs duty to encourage domestic manufacturing of mobile phones ( assembly , programming , testing and packaging ) .
In addition , the Electronic Development Fund was created in February 2016 to provide risk capital to firms developing new technologies in the sphere of electronics and information technology ( MeitY , 2018 ) .
With Make in India , mobile phone handsets and components manufacturing have emerged as a flagship sector .
Among the major categories of services , export of travel services declined significantly , owing to moderate growth in foreign tourist arrivals during 2018-19 , especially from higher per capita income countries such as _ the US ( accounting for 14 per cent of the total ) and the UK ( accounting for 9 per cent of the total ) .
By contrast , travel payments by outbound Indian tourists increased significantly , resulting in a decline in net travel receipts by 24 per cent .
India ' s software exports demonstrated resilience , surviving difficult global market conditions during the year .
India remained the top exporter of telecommunications , computer and information services in the world with share of around 10 per cent .
During 2018-19 , Indian software exports grew by around 7.6 per cent on a y-o-y basis on the back of strong performance of banking , financial services and insurance ( BFSI ) verticals .
Inbound remittances by Indians employed overseas rebounded during 2018-19 .
In 2018 , India retained its top position followed by China , Mexico , the Philippines and Egypt .
The net outgo in the form of payments of interest and dividend for servicing the stock of foreign liabilities increased marginally to US $ 28.9 billion in 2018-19 from US $ 28.7 billion a year ago .
Debt liabilities in the form of interest payments , which includes payment of interest by foreign direct investment ( FDI ) enterprises to their parent companies abroad , foreign portfolio investment ( FPI ) debt holdings , external commercial borrowings ( ECBs ) , trade credits , bank overseas borrowings , non-resident deposits , coupled with non-debt liabilities in the form of dividend pay-outs on investment in equity and investment fund shares accounted for around 70 per cent of total investment income outgoes in 2018-19 .
A predominant part of dividend payments is , however , deployed back by domestic FDI companies .
The CAD widened to 2.1 per cent of GDP from 1.8 per cent a year ago , primarily on the back of the higher trade deficit ( Chart II.6.7 ) .
While the erosion in net terms of trade ( ToT ) caused by higher commodity prices ( e.g. , crude oil , coal and fertilisers ) added 0.5 percentage points of GDP to the incremental CAD during 2018-19 , higher import volumes contributed another 0.1 percentage points ( Chart II.6.8 ) .
Net capital flows were not sufficient to finance the higher CAD , given net outflow of FPI ( Chart 11.6.9 ) .
This led to a depletion of foreign exchange reserves after six consecutive years of accretion on a BoP basis .
Within capital flows , FDI remained predominant as in the preceding year ( Table II.6.2 ) , Chart though it could finance only 53.6 per cent of the CAD in 2018-19 as compared with 62.2 per cent a year ago .
In response to the improvement in the domestic business environment , resilient growth prospects and low inflation , India has attracted a considerable amount of FDI in recent years .
With further rationalisation of domestic business procedures ( e.g. , introduction of the GST ) and focus on automatic route with minimal intervention , India gained 23 notches in terms of the World Bank ' s ease of doing business index ( 2019 ) and was ranked 77 among 190 countries .
Higher FDI flows went to sectors such as manufacturing , financial services , retail and wholesale trade and computer services .
Despite similar changes in the DTAA treaty , Singapore remained the most preferred route for foreign companies to invest in India ( Chart II.6.10 and Appendix Table 9 ) .
India ' s FDI performance is also noteworthy in the context of global FDI which fell by 13 per cent in 2018 to an estimated US $ 1.3 trillion from US $ 1.5 trillion in 2017 ( UNCTAD , 2019 ) .
This was mainly due to large repatriations of retained earnings by the US-based multinational enterprises in the aftermath of corporate tax reforms in the preceding year .
India was among the few major EMEs that received higher inward FDI during the period .
Domestic firms continued to expand their overseas business operations by enhancing direct investment stakes abroad .
Outward FDI was mainly in the form of equity and loans to subsidiaries / affiliated enterprises by resident firms , 66 per cent went to financial , insurance and business services , and manufacturing .
As regards FPI flows , there was net sale of US $ 2.2 billion in 2018-19 as against a net purchase of US $ 22.2 billion in 2017-18 .
This essentially reflected global portfolio rebalancing as investors turned away from EMEs and shifted to safe haven assets during April-December 2018 .
In Q4 : 2018-19 , however , FPls responded to the ebbing of global risks and made net purchases of about US $ 11.5 billion in the domestic capital market , partly recouping the net sales of US $ 13.7 billion in the preceding three quarters ( Chart II.6.11 ) .
Although investment limits for FPls in both government securities and corporate bonds were enhanced during the year , the utilisation of these limits fell in both segments .
Various - policy measures were undertaken to expand investment opportunities for FPls , which , inter alia , included ( i ) relaxing the minimum residual maturity requirement in government securities ( including in Treasury Bills ) , subject to certain conditions ; and ( ii ) permitting FPIs to invest in corporate bonds with minimum residual maturity of above one year instead of three years .
Furthermore , in order to boost long-term FPI investment , the Reserve Bank introduced a ' Voluntary Retention Route ' scheme under which investments by FPIs in the debt market are not subject to macro- prudential and other regulatory norms , provided they voluntarily commit to retain a required minimum percentage of their investments in India for a minimum period of three years .
Among other forms of financial flows , ECBs to India recorded net inflows of US $ 9.8 billion in 2018-19 as against an outflow of US $ 0.8 billion a year ago .
Various measures were undertaken to rationalise the extant ECB policy framework which included ( i ) merging of Tracks | and Il into foreign currency denominated ECBs and rupee denominated ECBs ; ( ii ) allowing a borrowing limit of US $ 750 million a year under the automatic route ; ( iii ) expansion of the list of eligible borrowers to include all entities eligible to receive FDI , registered entities engaged in micro- finance activities , registered societies / trusts / cooperatives and non-government organisations ; ( iv ) reduction of tenure for exemption of mandatory hedging for eligible borrowers from 10 years to 5 years ; ( v ) easing of end-use restrictions ; ( vi ) reduction in the minimum average maturity requirement for borrowings in the infrastructure sector to three years ; and ( vii ) permitting public sector oil marketing companies to raise ECBs for working capital purposes .
In the aftermath of the discontinuation of Letters of Undertaking ( LoUs ) / Letters of Comfort ( LoCs ) in March 2018 , importers ' recourse to buyers ' credit declined sharply , partly substituted by an increase in suppliers ' credit .
Non-resident deposit flows recorded an increase of 7.4 per cent in 2018-19 on the back of increased inflows under Non-Resident ( External ) Rupee accounts ( NRE ) and Non-Resident Ordinary ( NRO ) accounts .
Deposits under the NRE scheme contributed 70 per cent of net flows during the year .
The rupee ' s depreciation and improved income conditions in home countries of non-residents boosted these flows ( Table II.6.3 ) .
At end-March 2019 , India ' s external debt increased by US $ 13.7 billion ( .e. , 2.6 per cent ) from its level at end-March 2018 , primarily on account of an increase in short-term debt , commercial borrowings and _ non-resident deposits .
Commercial borrowings remained the largest component of external debt with a share of 38.0 per cent , followed by non- resident deposits ( 24.0 per cent ) and short-term trade credit ( 18.9 per cent ) .
As a ratio to GDP , external debt declined from 20.1 per cent at end- March 2018 to 19.7 per cent at end-March 2019 .
Notwithstanding this favourable development , some external vulnerability indicators worsened during the year .
The share of short-term debt ( on both original and residual maturity basis ) in total external debt increased , while the reserves cover of imports and short-term debt ( on both original and residual maturity basis ) declined partly reflecting depletion of reserves during the year .
Consequently , India ' s net international investment position ( NIIP ) deteriorated by US $ 17.9 billion .
The resumption of capital inflows in Q4 : 2018-19 along with the Reserve Bank ' s buy / sell swap auctions of US $ 5 billion , for a tenor of 3 years in March 2019 , to inject rupee liquidity enabled an accretion to the foreign exchange reserves during the quarter .
A similar swap auction in April 2019 led to further increase in forex reserves in 2019-20 so far .
India ' s foreign exchange reserves were at US $ 430.5 billion on August 16 , 2019 - an increase of US $ 17.6 billion over end-March 2019 .
To sum up , India ' s external sector came under pressure during 2018-19 as the CAD widened , external financing conditions tightened , and the foreign exchange reserves were depleted .
External demand conditions have been impacted by the slowdown in global trade , investment , and output even as trade tensions have heightened .
Forex operations by the Reserve Bank and large currency expansion exacerbated the pressure on system level liquidity during 2018-19 , warranting active liquidity management through a variety of instruments : regular repos and reverse repos under the liquidity adjustment facility ( LAF ) ; fine-tuning variable rate auctions of both repos and reverse repos ; outright open market operations ( OMOs ) ; and foreign exchange swaps .
Against the above backdrop , section 2 presents implementation status of the agenda set for 2018-19 while priorities of the Monetary Policy Department in 2019-20 have been discussed in section 3 .
In the run-up to the third bi-monthly statement in August 2018 , actual inflation outcomes in May and June 2018 turned out to be a little below the trajectory projected earlier , as the seasonal summer surge in vegetables prices remained muted and fruits prices declined .
The inflation projection for Q2 : 2018-19 was revised marginally downwards to 4.6 per cent , marginally upwards to 4.8 per cent for H2 : 2018-19 ; and at 5.0 per cent in Q1 : 2019-20 .
Volatile crude oil and financial asset prices and hardening of input price pressure in the manufacturing sector were seen as risks to the baseline inflation path besides those cited in June .
Against this backdrop , the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 25 bps with five members voting in favour of the resolution and one member voting for a pause .
By the time of the fourth bi-monthly policy for 2018-19 in October 2018 , CPI headline inflation fell from 4.9 per cent in June to 3.7 per cent in August , dragged down by a sharp decline in food inflation .
In the run-up to the fifth bi-monthly monetary policy statement of December 2018 , inflation eased more than anticipated in September-October 2018 , primarily due to the unexpected slipping of food prices into deflation in October , even as inflation in non-food prices registered a broad-based increase .
By the time the MPC met for the sixth bi-monthly policy in February 2019 , food prices sank further into deflation for the third consecutive month in December 2018 , inflation in the fuel group moderated considerably and inflation excluding food and fuel eased .
The first bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2019-20 in April 2019 took place in an environment of a slowing down of the growth momentum across advanced economies ( AEs ) and emerging market economies ( EMEs ) .
On the domestic front , food inflation remained in deflation for the fifth consecutive month in February 2019 and the fall in fuel inflation deepened .
Taking these developments , and assuming a normal monsoon in 2019 , the path of inflation was revised downwards to 2.4 per cent in Q4 : 2018-19 , 2.9-3.0 per cent in H1 : 2019-20 and 3.5-3.8 per cent in H2 : 2019-20 , with risks broadly balanced .
In the second bi-monthly monetary policy meeting of June 2019 , the MPC unanimously decided to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 bps to 5.75 per cent and change the stance of monetary policy from neutral to accommodative .
This decision was based on an assessment of a weakening of growth impulses since the April 2019 policy , driven by a sharp slowdown in investment activity along with continuing moderation in private consumption growth , and a widening of the output gap .
The output gap - the deviation of the actual output level from its potential level - is a proxy for demand-supply mismatches and plays an important role in medium-term inflation dynamics .
Recent research has _ highlighted that a macro-financial model allowing for inter- linkages between economic and financial cycles could provide a more comprehensive view of demand conditions , potential output and natural rate of interest ( Box Ill.1 ) .
There is a growing body of literature which suggests that the estimation of economic cycle / output gap can be substantially improved by including information on the financial cycle , especially during boom / bust phases .
A macro-financial model estimated by augmenting the Monetary Policy Model ( MPMOD ) ( Alichi et al . , 2018 ) , with a financial block ( Juselius et al . , 2017 ) , helps to understand the interlinkage between financial and economic cycles in India ( Chart 1 ) .
The interest rate feeds into the leverage gap - firming up of the real interest rate gap brings down asset prices .
The debt service gap depends on the long-term interest rate - an increase in the nominal lending rate increases the interest payment burden and , in turn , the debt service gap .
The debt service gap feeds negatively into asset price growth and , hence , boosts the leverage gap .
Apart from cyclical variables , long-term trend variables are also interlinked in the model .
The natural rate of interest ( r * ) is related positively to the growth rate of potential output .
Quarterly data from Q2 : 2008-09 to Q2 : 2018-19 are used for the exercise , and the system of equations is estimated in a Bayesian framework .
The empirical estimates suggest that ( i ) an increase in the debt burden has a negative impact on asset price growth , pushing up the leverage gap , tightening financial conditions and the output gap ( Chart 2a ) , which leads to reduction in interest rates and brings the debt burden back to steady state ; ( ii ) an increase in leverage leads to decline in credit expansion and a fall in the credit-GDP ratio , which tightens financial conditions and leads to a fall in the output gap ( Chart 2b ) ; and ( iii ) an increase in the policy interest rate increases long-term interest rates with some negative impact on asset prices ; the resulting tightening of financial conditions lead to the widening of a negative output gap ( Chart 2c ) .
The characterisation of the financial cycle is based on two long run relationships that together determine the long run sustainability of the credit-GDP ratio .
The deviation of this relationship from its long-term trend is defined as debt service gap ( Juselius et al . , 2017 ) .
Subsequently , as the impact of this configuration diminished over time , it spurred some recovery in credit markets and a revival in asset markets , leading to a faster closing of the output gap from 2017 .
During 2012 to 2017 , the output gap estimates obtained by incorporating the financial cycle were lower than estimates without it .
The operating framework of monetary policy aims at aligning the operating target - - the weighted average call rate ( WACR ) - with the policy repo rate through proactive liquidity management , consistent with the stance of monetary policy .
Consequently , the estimates of the natural rate of interest were also higher during that period .
On the other hand , the output gap estimates were found to be higher since 2017 ; the potential output and natural rate of interest were lower in comparison with the estimates without including the financial cycles .
Furthermore , the Reserve Bank decided to augment its liquidity management toolkit and injected rupee liquidity for longer duration through long-term foreign exchange buy / sell swaps .
Accordingly , it conducted USD / INR buy / sell swap auction of US $ 5 billion for durable liquidity of ₹ 345.6 billion .
After remaining in deficit during April and most of May , systemic liquidity turned into surplus in June driven by large government spending after the general elections .
The Reserve Bank absorbed liquidity of ₹ 517 billion in June , as against an injection of ₹ 700 billion in April and ₹ 334 billion in May on a daily net average basis under the LAF .
During Q1 : 2019-20 , the Reserve Bank conducted four OMO purchase auctions - two each in May and June amounting to ₹ 250 billion and ₹ 275 billion , respectively .
It also conducted a US $ 5 billion buy / sell swap auction amounting to ₹ 348.7 billion for a tenor of 3 years on April 23 to inject durable liquidity into the system .
As alluded to earlier , the objective of liquidity management is to align the WACR - the operating target - with the policy repo rate .
During 2018-19 , the WACR generally traded below the policy repo rate till January 2019 , but hardened intermittently thereafter and spiked at the year-end ( Chart IlII.5 ) .
During Q1 : 2019-20 , the WACR showed two-way movements around the policy repo rate .
The negative spread of the WACR over the repo rate moderated from 11 bps in April to 5 bps in October 2018 but increased thereafter to 12 bps in January ( Chart III.6 ) .
Overall , the WACR remained 8 bps below the policy rate in 2018-19 ( 10 bps in H1 and 6 bps in H2 ) .
During Q1 : 2019-20 , the WACR averaged close to the repo rate .
Following the 50 bps increase in the policy repo rate during June-August 2018 ( 25 bps each in June and August 2018 ) , banks raised their deposit and lending interest rates ( Table III.2 ) .
Banks had started raising their term deposit rates even earlier - from December 2017 - as surplus liquidity in the system waned .
The rise in term deposit rates exerted upward pressure on the cost of funding of banks , which fed into their marginal cost of funds-based lending rates ( MCLRs ) .
First , lending interest rates are typically linked to 1-year MCLR ; consequently , interest rates on such loans are reset annually on the due dates .
Second , a portion of the loans contracted during July 2010 - March 2016 and still outstanding continues to be linked to the base rate , which remained practically unchanged during both the tightening and easing phases .
Monetary transmission remained uneven across sectors , reflecting varied credit demand and credit risk .
During the tightening phase ( June 2018-January 2019 ) , interest rates on outstanding loans increased in respect of sectors such as agriculture , housing and education , while they declined in the case of industry , trade and professional services sectors ( Table III.3 ) .
During the easing phase beginning from February 2019 , lending rates declined for most sectors .
The Reserve Bank had proposed in December 2018 that all new floating rate personal / retail loans ( housing , auto , etc . ) and floating rate loans to micro and small enterprises extended by banks beginning April 1 , 2019 would be benchmarked to external benchmarks , viz . , ( i ) the policy repo rate ; or ( ii ) any benchmark market interest rate produced by the Financial Benchmarks India Private Ltd . ( FBIL ) , including Treasury bill rates .
During 2018-19 , studies were undertaken on a range of issues to improve the analytical inputs for the conduct of monetary policy : an examination of drivers of the investment cycle to understand the duration of investment cycles and inflexion points / structural breaks ; determinants of economic activity , and the role of monetary and fiscal policies ; the incorporation of a fiscal block in the quarterly projection model for an enhanced understanding of monetary-fiscal interface ; estimates of the finance-neutral output gap which incorporates the role of financial factors ( bank credit , equity prices and policy repo rate ) in assessing demand conditions ; an assessment of the impact of minimum support prices and house rent allowances on inflation ; macroeconomics of crude oil prices ; and , forex market operations and liquidity management .
Research studies were also undertaken on measurement issues relating to housing services in CPI and the role of monetary policy in movement of bond yields .
During 2019-20 , the focus will be on refining the liquidity forecasting framework , sharpening the estimation of currency in circulation at various frequencies ( such as yearly , quarterly , monthly , fortnightly and weekly ) and an overall reviewing of operational aspects of the liquidity management framework , including aspects relating to structural liquidity balance and distributional asymmetry in liquidity .
An analysis of recent food _ inflation dynamics will be carried out to understand the sources of volatility and to examine the relative role of cyclical and structural factors at play .
Furthermore , the nature of spatial dimensions of inflation will be studied to better understand the divergences in inflation rates across major groups / sub-groups and changes in them over time .
In order to enhance the understanding of monetary transmission , an analysis of sectoral credit flows would be undertaken .
The implications of the asset quality / health of the banking sector and NBFCs on credit flows to the commercial sector would also be examined .
The Reserve Bank has made sustained efforts during the year to increase the penetration of formal financial services in unbanked areas , while continuing with its policy of ensuring adequate flow of credit to all productive sectors of the economy .
Some of the new initiatives during the year include setting up of an expert committee / working group to examine the issues relating to credit flow to MSMEs and agriculture sectors , and allowing SCBs to co-originate loans with non-deposit taking systemically important NBFCs for credit delivery to the priority sector .
The Reserve Bank continued its focus on strengthening the credit delivery mechanisms to ensure adequate and timely flow of credit to all productive sectors of the economy , especially agriculture and micro , small and medium enterprises ( MSMEs ) , and also ensuring the availability of banking services to all sections of people in the country .
In order to review the credit flow to these sectors , an Expert Committee on MSMEs as well as an Internal Working Group to review agricultural credit were constituted .
Further , the Reserve Bank has prepared the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion ( NSFI ) 2019-24 under the aegis of the Financial Inclusion Advisory Committee ( FIAC ) , to ensure access to financial services to all the citizens in a safe and transparent manner .
The primary objective is to enable the financially excluded to have an access to financial services from the financial institutions .
Several innovative measures were undertaken to facilitate the creation of a conducive environment and increase the level of penetration of the banking system to serve the unserved and underserved population for achieving the objective of sustainable and inclusive economic growth .
The co-origination model was rolled out which enables the scheduled commercial banks ( SCBs ) to co-originate loans with non-deposit taking systemically important NBFCs ( NBFCs- ND-Sl ) for credit delivery to the priority sector .
As financial literacy precedes financial inclusion , a two-tier ' Train the Trainers ' programme was designed to build the capacity and skills of business correspondents ( BCs ) for effectively delivering financial services at the grass-root level .
Similarly , to build capacity and skills , and sensitise the Counsellors of Financial Literacy Centres ( FLCs ) and rural banks ' branch managers for delivering basic financial literacy at the ground level , a two-tier programme on financial literacy was designed .
Further , the National Centre for Financial Education ( NCFE ) has been set up under Section 8 of the Companies Act 2013 to focus on promoting financial education across the country for all sections of the population as per the National Strategy for Financial Education ( NSFE ) .
In this context , the Financial Inclusion and Development Department ( FIDD ) of the Reserve Bank is the nodal department for formulating and implementing policies for promoting financial inclusion in the country .
Against the above backdrop , implementation status of agenda for 2018-19 is presented in section 2 , covering performance of credit flow to priority sectors and developments with respect to financial inclusion and financial literacy .
The agenda for 2019-20 is provided in section 3 .
In order to strengthen the BC model , " Train the Trainers " programme for the capacity building of BCs was rolled out in March 2019 in co-ordination with College of Agricultural Banking ( CAB ) , Pune .
These branch managers , in turn , are expected to sensitise and handhold the BCs attached to their branches .
The baseline survey forming part of the impact assessment of the pilot Centres for Financial Literacy ( CFL ) project has been completed .
Similarly , the desired process to get the Financial Inclusion Plans ( FIPs ) integrated with Automated Data Extraction Project ( ADEPT ) has been initiated .
The preparation of the framework for credit delivery to tenant farmers has been subsumed in the Internal Working Group set up to review agricultural credit .
The overarching principle of priority sector lending ( PSL ) is to enhance credit flow to those vulnerable sections of the society which despite being credit worthy may not get timely and adequate credit in the absence of a special dispensation .
Priority sector loans include small value loans to farmers for agriculture and allied activities , MSMEs , housing , education , and other low-income groups and weaker sections .
Social infrastructure and renewable energy have also been brought under the ambit of PSL .
The Priority Sector Lending Certificates ( PSLCs ) scheme was introduced in April 2016 as The Priority Sector Lending Certificates a mechanism to incentivise banks which surpass their targets in lending to different categories under the priority sector .
PSLCs allow market mechanism to drive priority sector lending by leveraging the comparative strength of different banks .
A platform to enable trading in the certificates has been provided by the Reserve Bank through its Core Banking Solution ( CBS ) portal ( e-Kuber ) .
The PSLC platform saw active participation from all the eligible entities including Urban Co-operative Banks ( UCBs ) and Small Finance Banks ( SFBs ) during 2018-19 .
Among the four PSLC categories , highest trading was recorded in the case of PSLC- General and PSLC-small and marginal farmer , with the transaction volumes at ₹ 1,324.8 billion and ₹ 1,125.0 billion , respectively .
Since 2015-16 , SCBs _ have been directed to ensure that the overall lending to non-corporate farmers does not fall below the system-wide average of the last three years .
SCBs were also directed to reach the level of 13.50 per cent direct lending to beneficiaries that constituted the erstwhile direct lending to agriculture .
For 2018-19 , the applicable system- wide average target was 11.99 per cent .
The arrangement entails joint contribution of credit by both lenders at the facility level and sharing of risks and rewards within an appropriate alignment of respective business objectives as per mutually decided agreement between the bank and the NBFC .
In this regard , guidelines were issued to banks and NBFCs in September 2018 .
The Government of India has been fixing the target for agricultural credit every year .
During 2018-19 , the Government of India set the target of ₹ 11,000 billion for agricultural credit .
As on March 31 , 2019 , commercial banks achieved 19.9 per cent of their target whereas co- operative banks and regional rural banks ( RRBs ) achieved 93.26 per cent and 105.78 per cent , respectively ( Table IV.2 ) .
The target for 2019-20 is ₹ 13,500 billion .
The Kisan Credit Card ( KCC ) has emerged as an innovative credit delivery mechanism to provide adequate and timely bank credit to farmers under a single window for their cultivation and other needs , including consumption , investment and insurance .
The KCC Scheme has now been extended to farmers involved in animal husbandry and fishery to enable them to meet their working capital requirements .
Currently , the National Disaster Management Framework of the Government of India covers 12 types of natural calamities under its ambit , viz . , cyclone , drought , earthquake , fire , flood , tsunami , hailstorm , landslide , avalanche , cloud burst , pest attack and cold wave / frost .
During 2018-19 , natural calamity was declared by seven states , viz . , Rajasthan , Andhra Pradesh , Kerala , Maharashtra , Karnataka , Tamil Nadu and Gujarat .
The extent of relief measures provided by banks at the time of natural calamities during 2018-19 is given in Table IV.4.
The measures taken by the Reserve Bank for facilitating flow of credit to MSMEs and other steps taken by the government over the last few years have resulted in an increase in credit flow to MSEs ( Table IV.5 ) .
The MSME sector plays a crucial role in the economy both in terms of its employment generation and _ reducing regional social economic imbalances ( Box IV.1 ) .
The government and the Reserve Bank have , from time to time , taken several steps to support the sector .
However , MSMEs continue to face challenges of formalisation , technology adoption , capacity building , backward and forward linkages , lack of access to credit , risk capital and access to latest technology and marketing .
Hence , during the Fifth Bi-Monthly Monetary Policy Statement for 2018-19 ( December 5 , 2018 ) , it was announced that the Reserve Bank will constitute an ' Expert Committee on Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises ' to identify causes and propose long-term solutions , for the economic and financial sustainability of the MSME sector .
Accordingly , the Committee was constituted ( Chairman : Shri U. K. Sinha ) .
The Committee held consultations with the Central Ministries , state governments , multilateral organisations , industry associations , MSME entrepreneurs and various other stakeholders , and looked into areas of capacity building , policy changes and financing needs to unlock the potential of this sector .
The Committee has made various recommendations in areas such as legislative and institutional framework , access to finance , capacity building and new technological interventions for lending to MSME sector .
The recommendations are being examined for implementation .
The Report is available on the RBI ' s website for wider dissemination .
However , access to finance and cost of credit have been a concern for the sector .
To address this issue , the Government of India , on November 2 , 2018 , announced 2 per cent interest subvention for the MSME sector , applicable for 2018-19 and 2019-20 .
All fresh or incremental amount of working capital or new term loan to the extent of only 210 million in the sector would be eligible for interest subvention during the period of the scheme .
All MSMEs which have a valid Udyog Aadhaar Number ( UAN ) and GSTN Number are eligible under the scheme .
Further , the loan accounts of the eligible beneficiaries under the scheme , on the date of filing claim , should not have been declared as NPA as per the extant guidelines in this regard .
No interest subvention shall be admissible to the eligible beneficiaries for any period during which their loan accounts remain under NPA category .
Small Industries Development Bank of India ( SIDBI ) is the nodal national level implementing agency for the scheme .
Regarding implementation of the scheme , the Reserve Bank has issued the operational guidelines to SCBs in February 2019 .
The Reserve Bank continued its efforts towards fulfilling the financial inclusion agenda during the year to help realise the intended economic and social objectives .
In this direction , several new initiatives were undertaken during 2018-19 .
A Committee of Executive Directors of the Reserve Bank was constituted to study the efficacy of the Lead Bank Scheme ( LBS ) and suggest measures for its improvement .
Based on the Committee ' s recommendations , on April 6 , 2018 , guidelines on the revamping of LBS were issued to all State Level Bankers Committee ( SLBC ) Convenor Banks / Lead Banks , as also separately to all Lead Banks on enhancing the effectiveness of Lead District Managers ( LDMs ) along with certain action points .
As per the action points suggested in the guidelines , a Steering Sub-committee of SLBC / UT Level Bankers Committee ( UTLBC ) has been constituted in all the states / UTs and a revised agenda has also been adopted for all SLBC / UTLBC meetings .
Action points pertaining to alignment of corporate business targets for branches , blocks , districts and states with an Annual Credit Plan ( ACP ) , standardisation of information / data , and management of data flow under the LBS are under various stages of implementation .
Under the LBS , one bank in each district is assigned the leadership role and acts as a consortium leader to co-ordinate the efforts of the banks in that district , particularly in matters such as branch expansion and credit planning to meet the credit needs of the district .
The assignment of lead bank responsibility to a designated bank in every district is done by the banks and one private sector bank have been assigned lead bank responsibility in 717 districts across the country .
In order to have a planned and structured approach to financial inclusion , banks have been advised to prepare Board-approved Financial Inclusion Plans ( FIPs ) .
These FIPs capture banks ' achievements on various parameters such as the number of outlets ( branches and BCs ) , Basic Savings Bank Deposit Accounts ( BSBDAs ) , overdraft facilities , KCCs and General Credit Card ( GCC ) accounts and transactions in ICT-BC accounts .
The progress made by banks on such parameters under FIPs is given in Table IV.6.
The Reserve Bank has taken several steps to provide banking facilities in the unbanked villages in the country .
The use of information technology ( IT ) and intermediaries has made it possible to increase outreach , scale and depth of banking services at an affordable cost .
SLBC convenor banks were advised that while opening new banking outlets in Unbanked Rural Centres ( URCs ) in tier 5 and 6 centres , banks should give priority to URCs having population above 5,000 ( .e. , tier-5 centres ) .
Further , SLBC convenor banks were advised to consider opening of a CBS enabled banking outlet or a part time banking outlet in the villages with population less than 2,000 that still remain unbanked .
To facilitate banks ( including SFBs ) in opening their outlets , SLBCs were also advised to compile and maintain an updated list of all URCs in the state and review the progress in SLBC meetings .
Access to formal finance can boost job creation , reduce vulnerability to economic shocks and increase investments in human capital .
At a macro level , greater financial inclusion can support sustainable and inclusive socio-economic growth for all .
To achieve the above objectives in a co-ordinated and time-bound manner , formulation of a National Strategy for Financial Inclusion ( NSFI ) is essential .
As of mid-2018 , more than 35 countries , including Brazil , China , Indonesia , Peru and Nigeria have launched an NFIS and another 25 countries are in the process of formulating a strategy .
Further , several countries have also updated their original NFIS ( World Bank , 2018 ) .
Also , 481,303 ( 97.85 per cent ) out of 491,879 identified villages across the country having a population of less than 2,000 have been provided with banking services ( September 30 , 2018 ) .
The document includes an analysis of the status and constraints in financial inclusion in India , specific financial inclusion goals , action plan to reach the goals and the mechanism to measure progress .
The strategy envisages to make formal financial services available , accessible , and affordable to all the citizens in a safe and transparent manner to support inclusive and resilient multi-stakeholder led growth . It proposes forward looking recommendations to help achieve universal access to financial services through a bouquet of basic financial services leveraging on the BC Model , access to livelihood and skills development , financial literacy and education , customer protection and grievance redressal with effective co-ordination .
While the various initiatives have helped in extending financial services to the hitherto excluded sections of society , the strategy aims to focus on deepening the reach , usage and sustainability of financial inclusion .
The document was approved by the Financial Stability and Development Council Sub-Committee on March 14 , 2019 .
During the first tier of the programme , Members of Faculty from the banks ' training establishments and officers from the Regional Offices of the Reserve Bank are sensitised at the CAB , Pune .
The second tier of the programme involves a one-day sensitisation workshop for bank branch managers ( with special focus on rural bank branches ) to be driven by the beneficiaries of the first-tier programme .
Finally , the bank managers being trained under this programme are expected to sensitise and handhold the BCs attached to their branches .
The NCFE has been set up under Section 8 of the Companies Act , 2013 as per the directions of the Financial Stability and Development Council - - Sub Committee ( FSDC-SC ) with a share capital of ₹ 1,000 million ( Shared among RBI , SEBI , IRDAI and PFRDA in the ratio of 30 per cent , 30 per cent , 30 per cent and 10 per cent , respectively ) .
The NCFE continued its focus on promoting financial education across India for all sections of the population under the aegis of the National Strategy for Financial Education for creating financial awareness and empowerment through financial education campaigns across the country in the form of seminars , workshops , conclaves , trainings , programmes , campaigns , etc .
Financial literacy is crucial for imparting efficacy to the financial inclusion initiatives of the Reserve Bank .
In this direction , a number of new initiatives were undertaken during 2018-19 .
The baseline survey forming part of the impact assessment of the pilot project on CFL has been completed during the year .
Many socially and economically relatively lower exposure to financial literacy initiatives thereby requiring more focused approach to these communities .
Out of the various financial education initiatives , one-to-one discussion and group training or awareness generation programme was found to be effective .
With regard to the effectiveness of media / channel used for dissemination of messages , television has the highest reach among the _ targeted rural population owing to its ability to transmit both audio and visual contents and thereby disseminating messages with higher visibility and recall for longer periods .
The survey has also suggested that adequate efforts on practical exposure to use of digital financial services and awareness on the grievance redressal mechanism are essential in helping people onboard to use digital financial services .
Further , there is a need to periodically review the existing training content and align them with the needs of the community in order to enable better adoption of desirable behaviour .
The Financial Literacy Week is an initiative of the Reserve Bank to promote awareness on key topics every year through a focussed campaign .
This year , Financial Literacy Week was observed during June 3-7 , 2019 on the theme of ' Farmers ' and how they benefit by being a part of the formal banking system .
To build awareness and disseminate financial literacy messages to the farming community , content in the form of posters / leaflets and Audio Visuals on Responsible Borrowing & Agricultural Finance were prepared .
Banks were advised to display the posters and content in their rural bank branches , FLCs , ATMs and websites .
Further , the Reserve Bank also undertook a centralised mass media campaign during the month of June 2019 on Doordarshan and All India Radio to disseminate essential financial awareness messages to farmers .
To build capacity and skills and sensitise the Counsellors of FLCs and rural bank branch managers for delivering basic financial literacy at the ground level , a two-tier programme on financial literacy was designed .
During the first tier of the program , the Chief Literacy Officers ( CLO ) and Lead Literacy Officers ( LLO ) of the banks are sensitised every year at CAB , Pune .
The second tier of the programme involves training of FLC Counsellors , rural branch managers of the bank and the sponsored RRBs by the LLOs of the banks .
The LLOs have been advised to conduct the Tier II program in co- ordination with the regional / staff training centres of banks .
During 2018-19 , 145,427 financial literacy related activities were conducted by the FLCs as compared to 129,280 activities during the preceding year .
Going forward , the Reserve Bank would undertake the following measures towards enhancing credit delivery and financial inclusion : ( a ) the CFL project has been extended to 20 tribal blocks of Rajasthan , Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh , and will run for a period of two years ; ( b ) the various recommendations made by the Expert Committee on MSME ( Chairman : Shri U. K. Sinha ) will be examined for implementation ; and ( c ) the Reserve Bank has constituted an Internal Working Group in January 2019 to review agricultural credit ( Chairman : Shri M. K. Jain , Deputy Governor ) .
The Working Group is likely to examine the issues of regional disparity in agricultural credit disbursement and arrive at workable solutions and policy initiatives for addressing skewed distribution of credit for agriculture including allied activities and augmentation of capital formation .
During 2018-19 , the Reserve Bank undertook several measures , to broaden participation in financial markets , ease access and transaction norms for participants , widen the range of financial products , improve financial market infrastructure and pursue rigorous surveillance to maintain market integrity .
The Reserve Bank conducted liquidity management operations ( including EX swap auctions ) for maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity in the financial system and intervention operations in the foreign exchange market to contain volatility .
In the endeavour to facilitate trade and payments along with orderly development of the foreign exchange market , efforts were made to streamline regulations and align them with the current business and economic environment .
The external commercial borrowings regime was also rationalised during the year .
The Reserve Bank remains engaged in developing financial markets to intermediate the requirements of resources of a fast-growing economy .
Efforts were also made to streamline regulations and to align them with the current business and economic conditions and reducing regulatory costs .
A notable development during the year in this direction was the introduction of the Single Master Form ( SMF ) under Foreign Investment Reporting and Management System ( FIRMS ) for reporting of foreign investments .
The external commercial borrowings ( ECBs ) regime was also rationalised during the year .
Against the above backdrop , section 2 covers several measures undertaken by the Financial Markets Regulation Department ( FMRD ) during the year to broaden participation in financial markets , widen the range of financial products and also improve financial market infrastructure .
Section 3 presents liquidity management and foreign exchange market operations of the Financial Markets Operations Department ( FMOD ) .
Section 4 covers various initiatives undertaken by the Foreign Exchange Department ( FED ) during the year to facilitate trade and payments while promoting orderly development of the foreign exchange market .
These departments also set out their agenda for 2019-20 in the respective sections .
FMRD is entrusted with the development , regulation and surveillance of money , government securities ( G-secs ) , foreign exchange and derivatives markets .
During 2018-19 , the Department undertook several measures to broaden participation in financial markets , both domestic and foreign - ease access and transaction norms for participants , widen the range of financial products , improve financial market infrastructure and pursue _ rigorous surveillance to maintain market integrity .
With the objective to further deepen the G-sec market , the ' When Issued ' directions were revised in July 2018 to liberalise eligible participants ' base and to relax entity-wise limits for taking positions .
Short sale in G-secs was introduced in February 2006 to provide participants with a tool to express two-way views on interest rates and thereby enhance price discovery .
In July 2018 , the participants ' base was liberalised and entity- wise and security category-wise limits for short selling in G-secs were relaxed in order to further develop and deepen the G-sec and repo market .
In July 2018 , comprehensive directions for repo in G-sec and corporate debt were issued to simplify and harmonise the regulations across different types of collateral and also to encourage wider participation , especially for corporate debt repos .
Payments Banks and Small Finance Banks were permitted to participate in the call money market both as borrowers and lenders , which would expand the participation base in the call money market and provide an avenue for liquidity management for these entities .
Non-residents have been permitted to access the onshore Over-the-counter ( OTC ) rupee interest rate derivatives market for hedging and other purposes in order to develop a deep and liquid interest rate derivatives market by broadening the participation base .
Non-residents can also trade in any product for hedging and can transact in the Overnight Index Swaps ( OIS ) market for purposes other than hedging , subject to a regulatory limit .
The exposure limit of 20 per cent of Foreign Portfolio Investors ' ( FPl ) corporate bond portfolio to a single corporate was removed in February 2019 to provide more flexibility to FPls for managing their debt investment portfolios .
With the objective of having a more predictable regime for investment by FPIs , the FPI limits are now being revised on a half yearly basis under the Medium-Term Framework ( MTF ) as alluded to earlier in Section II.4 of the chapter on Economic Review .
Accordingly , the investment limits for FPls were revised in March 2019 .
These draft directions proposed to merge the facilities for residents and non-residents into a single unified facility for all users and allow them to hedge their exposure by using any available instrument .
Users could also hedge their anticipated exposures .
Furthermore , it was also proposed to simplify the procedures for authorised dealers to offer foreign exchange derivatives .
A Task Force on Offshore Rupee Markets was set up in February 2019 with the objective to provide incentives for non-residents to move to domestic markets for their hedging requirements and to improve market liquidity to promote hedging activity onshore .
The Task Force would examine the reasons for development of offshore rupee markets and to recommend policy measures to address domestic constraints , if any .
Market abuse regulations were introduced in March 2019 , in line with the best global practices with the objective of putting in place a fair , open and transparent market underpinned by high ethical standards .
The regulations cover market manipulation , benchmark manipulation , misuse of information or any other similar practice under its ambit .
The Reserve Bank has been encouraging long-term stable foreign portfolio investments .
Towards this end , separate limits have been carved out of the General Investment Limit for FPls with a long-term view .
The Reserve Bank launched the Voluntary Retention Route ( VRR ) in debt on March 1 , 2019 under which FPls can voluntarily commit to remain invested in a Committed Portfolio Size ( CPS ) for a committed retention period ( minimum period of three years or as decided by the Reserve Bank ) .
Investments can be made in G-secs ( including State Development Loans ) and Treasury Bills ( VRR-Govt ) or in corporate bond instruments permitted under FEMA ( VRR-Corp ) or in all the instruments eligible under both VRR-Govt and VRR- Corp ( VRR-Combined ) .
Participating FPls are provided special facilities such as permission to carry out repo / reverse repo transactions for cash management and the use of currency / interest rate derivatives to hedge currency / interest rate risks .
They are also given the flexibility to modulate their investments between 75 - 100 per cent of CPS .
Electronic Trading Platform ( ETP ) Directions were issued to put in place a framework for authorisation of ETPs for financial market instruments regulated by the Reserve Bank , with the objective to improving transparency , reducing transaction time and costs , facilitating efficient audit trails , improving risk controls and enhancing market monitoring .
It also includes detailed eligibility criteria , technology requirements and reporting standards .
All new ETPs as well as existing ones are required to obtain authorisation from the Reserve Bank under this framework .
The Legal Entity Identifier ( LEI ) system was implemented in June 2017 for non-individual participants in OTC markets for rupee interest rate derivatives , foreign currency derivatives and credit derivatives .
At the end of the retention period , an FPI may ( a ) liquidate its portfolio and exit , or ( b ) continue its investment under VRR for an identical retention period , or ( c ) shift its investment to General Investment Limit subject to availability of limits therein , or ( d ) hold its investments until its date of maturity or sale whichever is earlier .
FPls can also exit before the committed retention period by selling their investments , fully or partly , to other FPI / FPIs which would need to abide by the same terms and conditions .
FPlIs can invest the income from their investments through the route at their discretion , and such investments will be permitted even in excess of the CPS .
The first tranche of investment limits ( ₹ 400 billion for VRR-Govt and ₹ 350 billion for VRR-Corp ) were made available for allotment ' on tap ' between March 11 , 2019 were made to FPls under VRR-Corp under the aforesaid tranche .
The second tranche of investment limits ( ₹ 546.06 billion for VRR-Combined ) was opened on May 27 , 2019 , and will remain open for allotment till December 31 , 2019 or till the exhaustion of the limits , whichever is earlier .
A phased approach to have smooth implementation has been adopted wherein entities with net worth exceeding % 2,000 million have to obtain the LEI before lower than that are given time till March 31 , 2020 .
Draft Directions on Financial Benchmark Administrators were released in February 2019 for public comments to improve the governance of the benchmark processes in markets regulated by the Reserve Bank .
International settlement of - central government securities by International Central Securities Depositories ( ICSDs ) will be implemented to permit non-resident clients of ICSDs to transact in central government securities offshore .
This would open up a new channel for non-residents to undertake transactions in central government securities .
An Internal Group was set up in August 2018 to comprehensively review timings of various markets and necessary payment infrastructures , and recommend revisions to market timings .
Based on its recommendations , steps will be taken to revise the market timings across products and funding markets to avoid any frictions .
The Department would continue to further develop and deepen the money , G-sec , foreign exchange and especially the interest rate and currency derivative markets in order to promote better risk management by banks and other market players .
Steps will also be taken to expand the participation base , introduce new products and simplify procedures .
Ensuring the integrity of the financial markets and eradication of market abuse would continue to be the priority of the Department .
The Department has _ initiated steps to develop an IT enabled Integrated Market Surveillance System ( IMSS ) for augmenting its surveillance capacities .
The broad objectives of the proposed system are surveillance of markets regulated by the Reserve Bank , trend analysis and compliance monitoring .
FMOD is entrusted with two _ primary responsibilities : first , conduct of liquidity management operations for maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity in the financial system ; and second , ensuring orderly conditions in the forex market through operations in the spot , forward and futures segments .
System liquidity shifted from surplus to deficit during the year as the overhang of demonetisation waned .
Large-scale _ capital outflows , coupled with above-trend expansion in currency in circulation continued to exert pressure on liquidity conditions , especially during the first half of the year .
The Reserve Bank operated the Liquidity Adjustment Facility ( LAF ) and the Marginal Standing Facility ( MSF ) to manage transient liquidity mismatches .
Consequently , the weighted average call rate ( WACR ) in the call money market - the operating target of monetary policy - remained broadly anchored to the policy repo rate .
With regard to durable liquidity , the Reserve Bank responded to market conditions by calibrating the pace of permanent liquidity operations .
The frequency and quantum of OMOs was increased during H2 : 2018-19 to meet the liquidity needs of the system .
During 2018-19 , the Reserve Bank conducted OMO purchase auctions to the tune of about 33.0 trillion , of which 22.5 trillion worth of OMO purchases were conducted in H2 alone .
The Reserve Bank decided to augment its liquidity management toolkit by adding FX swap auctions as an instrument to manage durable liquidity ( Box V.2 ) .
A foreign exchange swap ( FX swap ) between two parties involves the exchange of one currency for another on an agreed date , price and tenor , with a subsequent re- exchange of these two currencies on the maturity date .
The FX swap is the most popular over-the-counter foreign exchange instrument in the global forex market .
The main reason for the popularity of FX swaps is the elimination of exchange rate risk , as the initial and terminal exchange rates are agreed upon at the time of the contract .
FX swaps are usually used by banks / financial institutions and their customers ( multinational companies ) , institutional investors who want to hedge their foreign exchange positions , and / or engage in speculation .
Central banks in both advanced and emerging economies have used FX swaps under differing circumstances .
The Swiss National Bank used them as the main instrument for management of bank reserves , mainly because of the lack of short-term government securities .
The Monetary Authority of Singapore ( MAS ) actively uses FX swaps for liquidity management in addition to direct borrowing / lending , repos on Singapore Government Securities ( SGS ) and MAS Bills .
The Central Bank of the Russian Federation introduced the US $ / RUB sell / buy FX swaps in September 2014 for providing dollar liquidity support to Russian credit institutions .
Saudi Arabia has used FX swaps to provide emergency liquidity during a regional crisis , while South Africa conducts special currency swaps from time to time with banks .
Bahrain has also used US dollar swap facility to provide liquidity in special circumstances .
Other countries that have used the FX swap as a tool for managing liquidity include the Netherlands , Austria , Germany , Belgium , Kuwait , the United Arab Emirates , Oman , Malaysia and Thailand .
The Reserve Bank accepted US $ 5 billion in each of the auctions at the cut-off premium of 27.76 and 8.38 , respectively , and simultaneously injected ₹ 345.6 billion and ₹ 348.7 billion into the banking system .
The US dollar amounts mobilised through the swap auctions are reflected in the Reserve Bank ' s foreign exchange reserves for the tenor of the swap as well as in the Reserve Bank ' s forward liabilities .
Some volatility was observed in the long-term Non-Deliverable Forward ( NDF ) rates at the time of the first auction and Cash-Tom rates around the two auction dates ( Chart 1 : Panel B ) .
The auction had a cooling effect on money market rates and supplemented the usual year-end funds required by the banking system .
During the year , the rupee witnessed a general depreciating trend up to mid-October mainly due to rising crude oil prices , rising interest rates in the US and international trade and geo- political concerns .
However , the rupee recovered subsequently and exhibited an appreciating trend during the rest of the year as oil prices declined .
The Reserve Bank intervened in the forex market through operations in the onshore / offshore OTC and Exchange Traded Currency Derivatives ( ETCD ) segments to contain excessive volatility .
It will continue to monitor evolving liquidity conditions closely and will modulate operations to ensure alignment of the WACR with the policy repo rate .
The Department also proposes to continue policy-oriented research on financial markets .
As part of the Reserve Bank ' s commitment for adoption of the principles of ' FX Global Code ' in the domestic forex market , the Department will coordinate with India Foreign Exchange Committee ( IFXC ) to launch a " Public Register " for India .
FED aims at facilitating external trade and payments while enhancing ease of doing business .
During 2018-19 , the Department continued its efforts to streamline the operating framework of the Foreign Exchange Management Act ( FEMA ) to align it with the current business and economic environment .
It also took steps for improving the ease of doing business and reduce regulatory costs .
The introduction of the Single Master Form ( SMF ) for reporting of foreign investments under the Foreign Investment Reporting and Management System ( FIRMS ) was a notable development in this regard .
The ECB regime was also rationalised during the year .
In last year ' s Annual Report , FED had undertaken salient objectives in pursuit of its mission .
Key among them were the rationalisation of cross-border borrowing and _ _ lending regulations , improving information management in the context of foreign investment inflows while facilitating outward flows , apart from measures to provide a conducive environment for doing business in India .
A new soft-coded directive came _ into simplifying and consolidating regulations related to borrowing and lending between residents and non-residents .
Its salient features are : ( a ) bringing all debt instruments under a single notification by consolidating regulations under FEMA 3 , 4 and part of 120 ( Regulation 21 ) ; ( b ) delineating three schedules of transactions : ECBs ; trade credit ; and external commercial lending ; and ( c ) making regulations principle-based that obviate the need for frequent amendments .
Starting with ECBs , a rule-based dynamic limit for outstanding stock at 6.5 per cent of GDP ( US $ 160 billion for 2018-19 ) was adopted in consultation with the Government of India .
The framework for ECBs and Rupee Denominated Bonds ( RDB ) was rationalised to improve the climate for doing business ( Box V.3 ) .
In addition , the reporting of ECBs was simplified with the objective of reducing the reporting burden .
With effect from June 2 , 2018 , the Reserve Bank , in consultation with the SEBI , put in place a system for monitoring foreign investment limits in order to enable listed Indian companies to comply with various foreign investment limits .
Infrastructure and systems for operationalising the monitoring mechanism were put in place by the SEBI .
Accordingly , the depositories ( NSDL and CDSL ) have set up the necessary infrastructure and IT systems for disseminating information on the available investment headroom in respect of listed Indian companies , within the aggregate NRI / FPI limits or the sectoral cap .
The sectoral preferences for raising ECBs were removed to create a level playing field .
All entities eligible to raise FDI are now permitted to raise ECB .
Includes all entities from Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) or International Organisation of Securities Commissions ( IOSCO ) compliant countries ; strengthening Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism ( AML / CFT ) framework .
For working capital purposes and for resolution applicants under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process .
The breach of the aggregate NRI / FPI investment limits or the sectoral cap for a company would restrict any further purchases by FPI / NRIs .
Compulsory disinvestment by FPls and NRIs in case of excess holding was also introduced .
A new online reporting system - Foreign Investment Reporting and Management System ( FIRMS ) came into effect from September 1 , 2018 .
Also , with effect from September 1 , 2018 , FDI reporting for issue of capital instruments was made a single step reporting in SMF ( instead of earlier two-steps reporting ) .
The application has an inbuilt database , reducing manual intervention and involving a novel concept of entity master , which helps in monitoring the extent of total foreign investment in an entity at all times in the context of sectoral limits .
As per the SEBI ' s recommendations , the overall limit for overseas investment by Alternative Investment Funds ( AIFs ) / Venture Capital Funds ( VCFs ) was enhanced to US $ 750 million from US $ 500 million with effect from June 2 , 2018 .
The SEBI has put in place suitable reporting and reconciliation mechanisms to monitor the overall outstanding approvals with instructions to all AIFs on reporting guidelines .
A regular information exchange mechanism between the Reserve Bank and the SEBI has also been put in place to monitor limits for such overseas investments .
Post demonetisation of ₹ 1000 and ₹ 500 currency notes , currencies permitted to be carried to Nepal or Bhutan have been reviewed .
Now , an individual travelling from India to Nepal or Bhutan is permitted to carry the Reserve Bank currency notes in Mahatma Gandhi ( New ) Series of denominations ₹ 200 and / or ₹ 500 , subject to a total limit of ₹ 25,000 .
Instructions regarding currency notes of the Government of India and the Reserve Bank for any amount in denominations up to ₹ 100 shall continue .
With effect from March 28 , 2019 , no prior approval of the Reserve Bank is required , if government approval or license / permission by the concerned Ministry / Regulator has already been granted for opening of a Branch Office ( BO ) / Liaison Office ( LO ) / Project Office ( PO ) or any other place of business in India , where the principal business of the applicant falls in the defence , telecom , private security and information and broadcasting sectors .
In the case of proposals for opening a PO relating to the defence sector , no separate reference or approval of the Government of India shall be required if the applicant has been awarded a contract by / entered into an agreement with the Ministry of Defence or Service Headquarters or Defence Public Sector Undertakings .
A Foreign Portfolio Investor / Foreign Venture Capital Investor ( FPI / FVCl ) registered with the SEBI was allowed to open and maintain a non-interest bearing foreign currency account for the purpose of making investment in accordance with the Foreign Exchange Management ( transfer or issue of security by a person resident outside India ) Regulations , 2017 .
A citizen of Bangladesh or Pakistan , who has been granted a long-term visa ( LTV ) by the central government , may now open one Non- Resident Ordinary ( NRO ) Account with an AD bank in India .
With effect from March 28 , 2019 , Special Non-Resident Rupee ( SNRR ) accounts opened by any person resident outside India , including those registered with SEBI to make investment in India , can remain operative beyond the stipulated period of seven years , with the approval of the Reserve Bank .
With effect from March 28 , 2019 , Escrow Accounts can be opened by residents and non- residents for acquisition / transfer of capital instruments / convertible notes and can also be funded by guarantee ( s ) .
The Department ' s strategy for 2019-20 will focus on consolidating and _ carrying forward all these initiatives , with emphasis on continuous synchronisation of the FEMA operating framework with the evolving situation , especially rationalisation of money changing and merchanting activity , comprehensive review and _ simplification of reporting requirements of regulated entities and enhancing the role of Authorised Persons ( AP ) to reduce transaction costs .
Review and rationalisation of entry norms for being licensed as full-fledged money changer ( FFMC ) in alignment with the provisions of the Companies Act , including an online package for FFMC / upgraded FFMCs ( AD Category Il ) licensing , renewal , inspection , reporting and cancellation .
Consolidation and rationalisation of FEMA to deal with issuance of guarantees , with a focus on permitting bonafide transactions ; and a coherent and integrated outward direct investment policy .
A software platform for external commercial borrowings and trade credits reporting and approval ( SPECTRA ) encompassing the whole lifecycle from receipt of application to communication of decision and reporting of transactions would be implemented .
A comprehensive review of the reporting requirements would ' be _ - undertaken , keeping in view the diverse needs of various stakeholders ( including the government ) .
Further delegation of powers to APs to reduce transaction costs for users under a standardised framework through modifications in the IT packages and capacity building at the level of APs .
Creation of a detailed framework for enhancing FEMA awareness and conducting awareness programs and creation of digital content on an ongoing basis .
Against the backdrop of asset quality concerns in the banking sector , guidelines on loan systems for delivery of bank credit were issued in order to enhance credit discipline among large borrowers .
To further the efforts of resolution of stressed assets , and in light of the judgment of the Honble Supreme Court of India declaring the then existing framework as ultra vires , the revised prudential guidelines for resolution of stressed assets were issued .
Alignment of the Statutory Liquidity Ratio ( SLR ) with the Liquidity Coverage Ratio ( LCR ) , new guidelines on implementation of liquidity standards and capital regulation under Basel IL , strengthening of data protection and cyber security norms , Ombudsman Scheme for Digital Transactions ( OSDT ) and harmonisation of regulations of various categories of non-banking financial companies ( NBECs ) were carried out during the year .
Regulatory and supervisory policies for cooperative banks were harmonised with those of scheduled commercial banks ( SCBs ) .
The chapter discusses the regulatory and supervisory measures undertaken during the year to strengthen the banking system , and the priorities for 2019-20 .
Pursuant to the judgment of the Hon ' ble Supreme Court of India , which found the then existing framework for resolution of stressed assets ultra vires , the revised framework has been put in place .
During the year under review , the focus was on improving transparency in financial statements of banks , enhancing credit discipline among large borrowers , alignment of the SLR with the LCR requirements along with new guidelines on implementation of liquidity standards and capital regulation under Basel III norms and strengthening of data protection and cyber security norms .
Turning to other areas , harmonisation of regulations for various categories of NBFCs , revision of the extant guidelines on _ liquidity risk management by NBFCs , risk weighting of exposures to NBFCs as per the ratings assigned by the rating agencies , bringing all government- owned non-deposit taking systemically important NBFCs ( NBFC-ND-Sls ) and government-owned deposit taking NBFCs under the Reserve Bank ' s on-site inspection framework and _ off-site surveillance , engaged policy attention .
In the cooperative banking space , voluntary transition of Primary ( Urban ) Cooperative Banks ( UCBs ) into Small Finance Banks ( SFBs ) ; and country-wide awareness campaigns through print and electronic media ( including Reserve Bank ' s SMS handle ' RBISAY ' ) on various topics such as fictitious offers , the Basic Savings Bank Deposit Account ( BSBDA ) , banking facilities for senior citizens and differently abled persons and safe digital banking for banking sector as whole , became priorities .
The rest of this chapter is further divided into four sections .
Section 2 deals with the mandate and functions of Financial Stability Unit .
Section 3 provides various regulatory measures undertaken by the Department of Banking Regulation , the Department of Cooperative Bank Regulation and the Department of Non- Banking Regulation during the year .
Section 4 covers several supervisory measures undertaken by the Department of Banking Supervision , the Department of Cooperative Bank Supervision and the Department of Non-Banking Supervision and enforcement actions carried out by the Enforcement Department during the year .
Section 5 highlights the role played by the Consumer Education and Protection Department and the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation in protecting consumer interests , spreading awareness and upholding consumer confidence .
These departments have also set out their agenda for 2019-20 in their respective sections .
The mandate of the Financial Stability Unit ( FSU ) is to monitor the stability and soundness of the financial system by examining risks to financial stability , undertaking macro-prudential surveillance through systemic stress tests , financial network analysis ( Box VI.1 ) and by disseminating information and analysis through the Financial Stability Report ( FSR ) .
It also functions as a secretariat to the Sub-Committee of the Financial Stability and Development Council ( FSDC ) , a co-ordination council of regulators for maintaining financial stability and monitoring macro-prudential regulation in the country .
Risk Propagation through Financial Networks In a world of interconnected financial entities , network studies are assuming importance in order to understand the propagation of risks .
A complex interplay of factors is involved : ( a ) network topology ; ( b ) node characteristics populating the network ; and ( c ) nature of shocks .
Network topology can be undirected or directed .
In an undirected network topology , if the nodes i and j are connected , it implies that the node i can be reached from j or vice versa .
The FSR was published in December 2018 and June 2019 .
The FSDC Sub-Committee held one meeting in 2018-19 and discussed various issues impinging on financial stability including challenges of the quality of credit ratings and inter- linkages between housing finance companies and housing developers .
A thematic study on financial inclusion and financial stability , and the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion ( NSFI ) were also discussed .
Issues relating to the know your customer ( KYC ) processes consequent upon amendments in the Prevention of Money Laundering ( PML ) rules , implementation of risk-based supervision in the National Pension Scheme ( NPS ) Architecture of Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority ( PFRDA ) , systemic risk of open-ended debt mutual funds and application of the accredited investor framework of SEBI to peer to peer ( P2P ) lending platform , also engaged the IRTG .
In the year ahead , FSU will continue to conduct macro-prudential surveillance , publish the FSR and conduct meetings of the FSDC Sub-Committee .
In addition , the current stress testing framework / methodology will be strengthened to adopt evolving best practices .
The Department of Banking Regulation ( DBR ) is the nodal department for regulation of commercial banks for ensuring a healthy and competitive banking system dispensing cost effective and inclusive banking services .
The regulatory framework is fine-tuned as per the requirements of the Indian economy while adapting to the international best practices .
The Reserve Bank had put in place a framework for resolution of stressed assets vide Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code ( IBC ) , 2016 as the lynchpin .
Specifically , the framework required banks to cure the default in respect of large borrowers ( those to whom the exposure of the banking system was 20 billion or above as of then ) within 180 days of default , failing which insolvency proceedings had to be initiated against such borrowers .
The above framework was found to be ultra vires as per the Section 35AA of Banking Regulation ( BR ) Act , 1949 by the Hon ' ble Supreme Court vide judgment dated April 2 , 2019 .
In line with the judgment of the Hon ' ble Supreme Court , the revised prudential framework replaces the mandatory insolvency proceedings upon failure to implement a resolution plan with a system of disincentives in the form of additional provisioning for delay in implementation of resolution plan or initiation of insolvency proceedings .
The prudential framework also incorporates the following fundamental principles underlying the regulatory approach for resolution of stressed assests :
Future upgrades to be contingent on a meaningful demonstration of satisfactory performance for a reasonable period ;
Notwithstanding anything contained in the above framework , wherever necessary , the Reserve Bank will issue directions to banks for initiation of insolvency proceedings against borrowers for specific defaults so that the momentum towards effective resolution remains uncompromised .
It is expected that the current circular will sustain the improvements in credit culture that have been ushered in by the efforts of the Government of India and the Reserve Bank , and that it will go a long way in promoting a strong and resilient financial system in India .
Guidelines on loan system for delivery of bank credit were issued on December 5 , 2018 , in order to enhance the credit discipline among large borrowers .
For borrowers with aggregate fund-based working capital limit of ₹ 1,500 million and above from the banking system , a minimum level of ' loan component ' of 40 per cent of the sanctioned limit was made effective from April 1 , 2019 .
Further , the undrawn portion of cash credit / overdraft limits sanctioned to the aforesaid large borrowers , irrespective of whether unconditionally cancellable or not , shall attract a credit conversion factor of 20 per cent , effective April 1 , 2019 .
Exposures to ClCs , rated as well as unrated , will continue to be risk- weighted at 100 per cent .
SBM Bank ( India ) Limited ( subsidiary of SBM Group , Mauritius ) and DBS Bank India Limited ( subsidiary of DBS Bank Ltd . , Singapore ) were issued licenses on December carrying on banking business in India through the Wholly Owned Subsidiary ( WOS ) mode .
The Reserve Bank had issued guidelines for compensation of Whole Time Directors , Chief Executive Officers and control function staff of private sector and foreign banks in 2012 .
Based on the experience gained as well as evolving international best practices , these guidelines were reviewed and a Discussion Paper was released in February 2019 , inviting comments of stakeholders .
The definition of bulk deposits has been revised as ' Single Rupee term deposits of Rupees two crore and above ' for SCBs , excluding Regional Rural Banks ( RRBs ) and SFBs with effect the operational freedom of banks in raising bulk deposits .
The single borrower limit for NBFCs ( not financing infrastructure ) , which had been increased from 10 per cent to 15 per cent available till March 31 , 2019 .
In line with modifications to the Gold Monetisation Scheme ( GMS ) , 2015 by Government of India , the SCBs ( excluding RRBs ) were advised on January 9 , 2019 , that ' Charitable Institutions , central government , state government or any other entity owned by central government or state government ' were included as persons eligible to make deposits under the Scheme .
From November 2 , 2018 , the Government of India increased the interest equalisation rate from 3 per cent to 5 per cent in respect of exports by manufacturers in the MSME sector under the Interest Equalisation Scheme on Pre and Post Shipment Rupee Export Credit .
As per the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies of April 5 , 2018 , implementation of Ind AS for SCBs ( excluding RRBs ) was deferred by one year pending necessary legislative amendments to the BR Act , 1949 as also the level of preparedness of many banks .
As the legislative amendments are under consideration with the Government of India , implementation of Ind AS for banks was deferred till further notice .
Disclosure in the ' Notes to Accounts ' to the VI.30 Banks were advised on April 18 , 2017 to disclose details of divergence from Income Recognition , Asset Classification and Provisioning ( IRACP ) norms wherever , either ( a ) the additional provisioning requirements assessed by the Reserve Bank exceeded 15 per cent of the published net profits after tax for the reference period , or ( b ) the additional gross non-performing assets ( NPAs ) identified by the Reserve Bank exceeded 15 percent of the published incremental gross NPAs for the reference period , or both .
In terms of circular dated April 1,2019 , the disclosure requirement is linked to the reported profit before provisions and contingencies , instead of reported net profit .
Banks were required to make disclosure of divergence when either or both of the following conditions are satisfied : ( a ) the additional provisioning for NPAs assessed by the Reserve Bank exceeds 10 per cent of the reported profit before provisions and contingencies for the reference period , and ( b ) the additional gross NPAs identified by the Reserve Bank exceed 15 per cent of the published incremental gross NPAs for the reference period .
Consequent to notification of amendments to PML ( Maintenance of Records ) Rules , 2005 by Government of India in February 2019 and of " Aadhaar and other Laws ( Amendment ) Ordinance , 2019 , " amending PML Act , 2002 ,
Further , additional certifying authorities for certifying the OVDs of Non-Resident Indians ( NRI ) and Persons of Indian Origin ( PIO ) customers were specified in the master direction .
It also approved acquisition of controlling stake by Life Insurance Corporation of India Ltd .
With a view to facilitate consolidation among public sector banks ( PSBs ) , Government of India sanctioned a scheme entitled ' The Amalgamation of Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank with Bank of Baroda Scheme , 2019 ' , with Bank of Baroda as the transferee bank and Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank as transferor banks .
The Scheme came into force on April 1 , 2019 .
In view of the restraint placed by National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ( NCLAT ) vide Institutions for classifying the accounts of IL & FS or its entities as NPA without its prior permission , banks and AIFls were advised vide notes to accounts , amount which was NPA as per Income Recognition and Asset Classification ( IRAC ) norms but had not been classified as such , as well as provisions required to be made as per IRAC norms therefor .
The revised instructions on Rationalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy dated May 31 , 2019 has introduced the concept of Banking Outlet ( BO ) for RRBs on the lines of instructions issued to SCBs .
As per the revised instructions , RRBs can open branches in Tier 1 to 4 centres ( as per census 2011 ) only with the prior approval , subject to the compliance of prescribed eligibility criteria .
Further , as a transition measure , non-centrally cleared derivatives have been kept outside the purpose of LEF , Indian branches of foreign Global Systemically Important Banks ( G-SIBs ) shall not be treated as G-SIBs ( Box VI.2 ) .
As per the extant master circular on prudential norms for classification , valuation and operation of investment portfolio by banks , shifting of investments to / from HTM is allowed with the approval of the Board of Directors once a year , normally at the beginning of the accounting year and no further shifting to / from HTM is permissible during the remaining part of that accounting year , except when explicitly permitted by the Reserve Bank .
Apart from five types of transactions that are already exempted from inclusion in the 5 per cent cap , it was decided that repurchase of State Development Loans ( SDLs ) by the concerned state government shall also be exempted .
The facilities associated with BSBDA have been reviewed and certain improvements have been made vide circular dated June 10 , 2019 .
Additional value-added services , over and above the minimum facilities permitted , can be provided by banks with or without charge .
Under the exposure norms , a bank ' s exposure to a single borrower and a borrower group was restricted to 15 per cent and 40 per cent of capital funds ( Tier 1 + Tier 2 capital ) , respectively .
The norms also stipulated ceilings for certain sectors like capital market exposure , exposure to NBFCs and intra-group exposures .
In order to foster convergence among widely divergent national regulations on dealing with large exposures , the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued the Standards on ' Supervisory Framework for Measuring and Controlling Large Exposures ' in April 2014 .
The Reserve Bank decided to suitably adopt these standards for banks in India and , accordingly , the instructions on banks ' Large Exposures were issued in December 2016 , with implementation date of April 1 , 2019 .
The revised LEF introduces economic interdependence criteria for identifying group of connected counterparties , with effect from April 1 , 2020 , mandates look-through approach , and excludes entities connected with the sovereign from definition of group of connected counterparties , if not connected otherwise .
The guidelines align the Indian framework with international best practices and improve measurement , aggregation and monitoring of concentration risk .
Exposure limit for group of connected counterparties is capped at 25 per cent of Tier 1 Capital .
The framework requires group of connected counterparties to be identified based on the control criteria which is based on factors like ownership , voting rights , voting agreements , significant influence on the appointment or dismissal of an _ entity ' s administrative , management or supervisory body and _ significant influence on senior management .
Interbank exposures are subject to limit of 25 per cent of Tier 1 capital with constrained limits on exposures to global systemically important banks ( G-SIBs ) ; Indian branches of foreign G-SIBs will not be reckoned as G-SIBs under the framework and interbank exposure limit will also apply to exposure of Indian branches of foreign banks on their head-office including overseas branches / subsidiaries .
Considering the critical role played by Central Counterparties ( CCPs ) , clearing related exposure to Qualified Central Counterparties ( QCCPs ) are exempt from the framework .
The framework envisages Look-through approach for aggregating exposure to counterparties through structures like mutual funds and securitisation .
Exposure measurement is aligned with Basel Ill regulations by permitting use of Credit Risk Mitigation ( CRM ) and Credit Conversion Factors ( CCFs ) .
Entities connected with the sovereign are excluded from definition of group of connected counterparties , if not connected otherwise ( either by control criteria and / or by economic interdependence criteria , which is effective April 1 , 2020 ) .
Non-centrally cleared derivatives are exempt from the framework till March 31 , 2020. by banks with or without charge .
These additional facilities provided will not make the account a non-BSBDA .
Banks have to obtain a declaration from the customer that he / she has no BSBDA in any other bank .
The instructions come into force from July 1 , 2019 .
One of the key recommendations of the report of the IRTG on FinTech and Digital Banking ( Chairman : Shri Sudarshan Sen ) released on for " regulatory sandbox / innovation hub " within a well-defined space and duration where the financial sector regulator would provide the requisite regulatory guidance .
The feedback obtained is currently under examination and the Framework will be finalised soon .
With a view to moving further towards harmonisation with Basel Ill standards , instructions that the minimum leverage ratio shall be 4 per cent for Domestic Systemically Important Banks ( D-SIBs ) and 3.5 per cent for other banks .
Both the capital measure and the exposure measure along with leverage ratio are to be disclosed on a quarter-end basis .
All the past information has been migrated to CISBI and reporting henceforth shall be done by all entities / banks in the new system , which has the provision to maintain complete details of banks / AIFlIs with a time stamp .
In the first bi-monthly monetary policy statement , 2016-17 ( April 5 , 2016 ) , it was announced that the Reserve Bank would explore the possibilities of licensing other differentiated banks such as WLTF banks .
A Discussion Paper on the subject was released on Reserve Bank ' s website on April 7 , 2017 .
After considering various suggestions / feedback and discussions held with multinational banks and financial institutions , it emerged that there are challenges in evolving a sustainable and viable model for WLTF banks .
It was , therefore , decided not to pursue the proposal .
The Department will continue to work towards aligning the prudential regulatory framework with evolving BCBS and _ global standards / practices , including implementation of Ind AS for banks , subject to necessary legislative amendments .
Final prudential regulations will be issued to the AIFls , covering revised instructions on exposure norms , investment norms , risk management framework and select elements of Basel Ill capital framework .
The implementation of Ind AS for AIFls has been deferred and will be synchronised with the implementation of the same for the SCBs .
In the emerging FinTech area , focus will be on operationalisation of Regulatory Sandbox .
Guidelines on minimum balance requirements for savings bank accounts and penalty for non-maintenance will be reviewed .
Automated data flow in eXtensible Business Reporting Language ( XBRL ) platform will be used for settlement of claims relating to interest equalisation scheme .
Further , a Discussion Paper will be released on implementation of macro-prudential policies for addressing incipient credit risk in the system .
For the purpose of implementation of a framework for credit supply to large borrowers through market mechanism , a study would be undertaken based on the data from banks / Central Repository of Information on Large Credits ( CRILC ) .
Digital onboarding of bank customers would be facilitated , enabling video- based KYC for individuals under the provisions of PML Rules .
The Reserve Bank continues to play a key role in strengthening the cooperative banking sector by fortifying the regulatory and supervisory framework .
In this context , the Department of Cooperative Bank Regulation ( DCBR ) , which is in charge of prudential regulations of cooperative banks , took several initiatives in 2018-19 .
A Memorandum of Understanding ( MoU ) was signed by the state government , the Government of India and NABARD on the three unlicensed DCCBs in Jammu and Kashmir .
Accordingly , the state government released its share of ₹ 2.56 billion in March 2018 ( the same is held with the cooperative department of Jammu and Kashmir government for onward transmission ) .
The state government sanctioned the constitution of Professional Boards of the three unlicensed DCCBs in terms of Sub-Section ( 1 ) ( a ) of Section 30-B of Jammu & Kashmir Cooperative Societies ( Amendment ) Ordinance , 2018 for the implementation of revival package ( s ) sanctioned by the Government of India / state government / NABARD .
Issue of licenses to these three DCCBs will be considered after the DCCBs comply with the condition in respect of their achieving the required CRAR .
The High Powered Committee ( HPC ) on UCBs ( Chairman : Shri R. Gandhi ) , had , inter alia , recommended the voluntary conversion of large Multi-State UCBs into Joint Stock Companies and other UCBs meeting certain criteria into SFBs .
Tripura State Cooperative Bank Lid . , Tripura and Delhi State Cooperative Bank were included in the Second Schedule of the RBI Act , 1934 in January 2019 and May 2019 , respectively .
During 2018-19 , six proposals for mergers of UCBs were processed by the Department .
Of these , two merger proposals were approved and are awaiting final approval of the concerned Registrars of cooperative societies and one was rejected .
The remaining three merger proposals are presently under process .
The licenses of 4 weak UCBs were cancelled during the period of review .
The milestones for 2019-20 include issuance of revised guidelines on supervisory action framework for UCBs , formulation of policy framework for promoting consolidation in UCB sector and establishment of an Umbrella Organisation ( UO ) for UCBs ( Box VI.3 ) .
NBFCs play an important role in providing credit by complementing commercial banks and catering to niche sectors .
The Department of Non- Banking Regulation ( DNBR ) is entrusted with the responsibility of regulating the NBFC sector .
SPDs were permitted to offer forex services to their foreign portfolio investor ( FPI ) clients as part of their non-core activities , effective July regulations and specific permission from the Reserve Bank .
The MHP relaxation is in respect of receipt of repayment of six monthly instalments or two quarterly instalments ( as applicable ) , subject to the prudential requirement that minimum retention requirement ( MRR ) for such securitisation / assignment transactions shall be 20 per cent of the book value of the loans being securitised or 20 per cent of the cash flows from the assets being assigned .
This dispensation was given initially for a period of six months , i.e. , to May 2019 , up which has been further extended till December 31 , 2019 .
They also have limited avenues for meeting short-term liquidity requirements as only scheduled banks have direct access to the Reserve bank ' s liquidity support windows .
The UO would also be expected to set up Information Technology ( IT ) infrastructure for shared use of members to enable them to widen their range of services at a relatively lower cost .
Later in 2008 , the Reserve Bank set up a Working Group on Umbrella Organisation and Constitution of Revival Fund for Urban Cooperative Banks ( Chairman : Shri V. S. Das ) .
The Expert Committee on Licensing of New Urban Cooperative Banks ( Chairman : Shri Y. H. Malegam ) also recommended setting up of an UO in the year 2011 and the same was endorsed in 2015 by the High-Powered Committee on UCBs .
The Government of India extended the Interest Subvention Scheme for MSMEs , 2018 to all NBFC-ND-Sls , who were advised to take appropriate action for implementation of the Scheme and approach the nodal implementation agency , the Small Industries Development Bank of India ( SIDBI ) .
Regulations governing Asset Finance Companies ( AFCs ) , Loan Companies ( LCs ) and Investment Companies ( ICs ) were harmonised and they were merged into a new category called NBFC-Investment and Credit Companies ( NBFC- move towards activity-based regulation rather than entity-based regulation so as to provide more operational flexibility to NBFCs .
In view of the amendment to the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest ( SARFAESI ) Act , 2002 , ARCs have been permitted to acquire assets from other ARCs , subject to compliance with certain conditions .
Eligible NBFCs will have to satisfy certain conditions and seek specific permission from the Reserve Bank .
To augment risk management practices of the NBFC sector , NBFCs with asset size of more than 250 billion have been advised to appoint a CRO , with clearly specified role and responsibilities , who would be required to function independently so as to ensure highest standards of risk management .
The guidelines on liquidity risk management framework for NBFCs , including non-deposit taking systemically important Core Investment Companies ( CIC-ND-Sls ) with asset size of ₹ 1 billion and above and all deposit taking NBFCs irrespective of asset size , were reviewed in order to strengthen the Asset-Liability Management ( ALM ) framework for NBFCs and a draft liquidity risk management framework for NBFCs was placed on the Reserve Bank ' s website for public comments in May 2019 ( Box VI.4 ) .
In order to bring in more transparency and provide an effective and robust disclosure framework for NBFCs , the extant disclosure requirements for NBFCs will be reviewed .
The exercise of harmonising the regulatory framework for various categories of NBFCs , initiated during the year , will be pursued with a view to further bringing down the number of categories of NBFCs , thereby facilitating better implementation of activity based regulation .
A set of principles in the form of FPC will be issued for ARCs to encourage them to follow fair practices while dealing with stakeholders .
The Department of Banking Supervision ( DBS ) is entrusted with the responsibility of supervising SCBs ( excluding RRBs ) , LABs , Payments Banks ( PBs ) , SFBs , Credit Information Companies and AIFls based on _ supervisory inputs received through off-site monitoring and on-site inspections .
This has warranted a review of the liquidity risk management for NBFCs .
The extant ALM guidelines are applicable to non-deposit taking NBFCs with an asset size of ₹ 1 billion and above , and deposit taking NBFCs having a deposit base of ₹ 200 million and above :
Maturity gap analysis across time buckets with main focus on 30 / 31 days time bucket in which the negative gap is not supposed to exceed 15 per cent of the cash out flow .
ClCs with asset size of ₹ 5 billion and above to disclose the maturity pattern of assets and liabilities .
ALM Guidelines : ALM guidelines have been recast on the lines of those applicable to banks , incorporating ( a ) off- balance sheet and contingent liabilities ; ( b ) stress testing ; ( c ) contingency funding plan ; ( d ) intra-group fund transfers ; ( e ) collateral position management ; and ( f ) diversification of funding .
Maturity Buckets Revised : Maturity buckets have been made granular by trifurcating the 1 to 30 / 31 days bucket into 1-7 days , 8-14 days and 15 to 30 days , with cumulative gap limits set at 10 per cent , 10 per cent and 20 per cent of the respective outflows .
Cash flow stress will be captured at an early stage and mitigation is expected to be timely .
Liquidity Risk Monitoring Tools : NBFCs will be required to monitor ( a ) concentration of funding ( by counterparty , instrument , currency ) ; ( b ) available unencumbered assets ( that can be used as collateral for raising funds ) ; and ( c ) market related monitoring information ( equity prices , coupon on debts raised , regulatory penalty and the like ) .
Stock Approach to Liquidity Risk Management : Boards of NBFCs are required to identify critical ratios and monitor them against internally prescribed ceilings [ an illustrative list could include short-term liabilities to total assets ; short-term liabilities to long-term assets ; commercial papers to total non-convertible debentures ( NCDs ) of original maturity less than one year to total assets ; short term liabilities to total liabilities ; long term assets to total assets ] .
The proposed LCR framework will apply to all deposit taking NBFCs and NBFC-ND-Sls with asset size of ₹ 50 billion and above .
NBFCs to maintain LCR of minimum 60 per cent from April 1 , 2020 , progressively increasing in equal steps till it reaches the required level of 100 per cent , by April 1 , 2024 and maintaining it at minimum 100 per cent on an on-going basis with effect from April 1 , 2024 .
Action in respect of wherever necessary , is being initiated .
Fifty-seven banks , including six cooperative banks , were subjected to IT examinations to assess their level of cyber security preparedness and compliance with the circulars , advisories and alerts on cyber security issued by the Reserve Bank from time to time .
Targeted thematic examinations were also carried out , focusing on applications , infrastructure and systems used by the banks .
During the year , three cyber drills were conducted on hypothetical scenarios as table top exercises for informing banks ' prospective reviews of Cyber Crisis Management Plans / Incident Response Mechanisms .
During the year , key risk indicators were revised to ensure that banks provide a more accurate quantitative indication of cyber risk posture and adequacy of cyber controls implemented by banks .
Banks were advised to ensure that members of the Board , senior management and CXOs ( viz . , Chief Information Officer , Chief Technology Officer , Chief Risk Officer and Chief Information Security Officer ) undergo mandatory certification in IT and cyber security .
NBFCs to hold HQLAs to cover the net cash outflow over the next 30 day period under a situation of stress .
Computation of HQLAs to be based on prescribed haircuts applied on the eligible assets .
For computation of net cash outflow in the 30 day period , the stress scenario is built by overestimating outflows by 15 per cent and underestimating inflows by 25 per cent .
The number of cases of frauds reported by banks increased by 15 per cent in 2018-19 on a year-on-year basis ( Table VI.1 ) , with the amount involved rising by 73.8 per cent , though mostly related to occurrences in earlier years .
The average lag between the date of occurrence and its detection by banks was 22 months .
The average lag for large frauds , i.e. ₹ 1 billion and above , amounting to ₹ 522 billion reported during 2018-19 , was 55 months .
Among bank groups , PSBs , which constitute largest market share in bank lending , have accounted for the bulk of frauds reported in 2018-19 .
It was followed by private sector banks and foreign banks .
In terms of area of operations , frauds related to advances constituted the preponderant share of the total amount involved in frauds in 2018-19 , while the share of frauds in off-balance sheet items declined from a year ago ( Table VI.2 ) .
In terms of the number of frauds too , those related to advances were predominant followed by card / internet related frauds and deposits related frauds .
Frauds relating to card / internet and deposits constituted only 0.3 per cent of the total value of frauds in 2018-19 .
The Reserve Bank established agreements for supervisory cooperation with 48 banking supervisory authorities from various jurisdictions .
In order to strengthen cross border supervisory processes , meetings of Supervisory Colleges for State Bank of India , Punjab National Bank , Axis Bank , Bank of Baroda , Bank of India and ICICI Bank were held during the year with host supervisors and domestic regulators .
Under the Supervisory Programme for Assessment of Risk and Capital ( SPARC ) , RBS has been successfully implemented for banks operating in India over six supervisory cycles
The above data is in respect of frauds of ₹ 0.1 million and above reported during the period .
In order to understand the systemic linkage between banks ( SCBs and cooperative banks ) and NBFCs , and their interconnectedness , certain functions of supervisory departments are proposed to be integrated to enable : ( a ) holistic understanding of systemic risks ; ( b ) understanding linkages , contagion and risk build-up across entities for effective off-site monitoring ; and ( c ) identifying systemic early warning signals based on entity-agnostic thematic studies .
It is also proposed to have a dedicated and specialised cadre of officers for ensuring a state-of-the-art supervisory framework for banks .
Supervisory focus would be on effective risk discovery and better off-site monitoring through leveraging technology .
In view of the emergence of cyber risk among threats to financial stability , the DBS proposes to undertake cyber security related supervision of cooperative banks and NBFCs in a phased manner in addition to that of SCBs , Fls and ClCs .
In line with the evolution of regulatory guidelines on the implementation of IFRS / Ind AS , the impact on quantitative and qualitative reporting by banks would be reviewed , aligned and integrated with the supervisory framework .
An Information Technology ( IT ) solution ( ICMTS - Integrated Compliance Management and Tracking System ) has been envisaged to have an integrated approach to managing inspection lifecycle and programmes under RBS , IT examination and the like .
It will have capabilities such as _ built-in remediation workflows , time tracking , email-based notifications and alerts , Management Information System ( MIS ) reports and dashboards to gauge overall progress .
The Reserve Bank would coordinate with various agencies including Ministry of Corporate Affairs to examine the feasibility of interlinking various databases and information systems to improve the system of fraud monitoring and take necessary corrective regulatory and supervisory action .
To improve the fraud risk management framework for banks : ( a ) the master directions on frauds shall be revised to incorporate new instructions in the light of experience gained ; ( 6b ) workshops will be conducted on frauds for the bankers based on comprehensive reviews , to sensitise them on fraud prevention , prompt / accurate reporting and follow up action ; ( c ) fraud registry will be made more user-friendly ; and ( d ) fraud analytics will be improved .
The primary responsibility of the Department of Cooperative Bank Supervision ( DCBS ) is supervising UCBs and ensuring the development of a safe and well-managed cooperative banking sector .
To achieve this objective , DCBS undertakes periodic on-site and continuous off-site monitoring of the UCBs .
The adoption of a technological platform for CBS system in a few UCBs was delayed due to reasons such as lack of expertise and / or capital or recurring losses .
The Reserve Bank has taken measures and coordinated with the state governments to provide adequate support to such UCBs to enable them to implement CBS .
Consequently , except for a few UCBs with negative net worth , all UCBs that were not on CBS till a year ago , have initiated the process of implementation of CBS .
The inspection process of UCBs was reviewed and revised to make it more focussed and to capture embedded risks in financial and functional parameters .
The inspection rating model was also revised to reflect changes in the financial parameters in a precise manner .
All UCBs were advised to put in place a Cyber Security Policy , duly approved by their Board / Administrator , containing a framework and strategy to check cyber threats , depending on the level of complexity of business and acceptable levels of risk .
This policy has to be distinct from the IT / information systems ( IS ) policy of the UCB so that it highlights the risks emanating from cyber threats and the measures required to address / reduce these risks .
It is proposed to create a mechanism for sharing of fraud related information among UCBs on similar lines of CFR that is in place for commercial banks .
This will enable sharing of information on frauds in a timely and uniform manner across the sector .
In order to optimally utilise the available data for supervisory inputs , it has been planned to develop standardised reports based on revised incipient indicators derived from select financial parameters using off-site surveillance data for early assessment of deficiencies and timely supervisory action .
The UCB sector has adopted information technology ( IT ) in their day-to-day operations to improve the quality and ease of delivery of banking services , accounting and MIS .
It has , however , exposed the UCBs to risks associated with IT and cyber threats .
Keeping in view incidents of high profile cyber-attacks , theft of customer information , fraudulent use of net banking and skimming of debit / credit cards , putting in place a system to protect UCBs from risk arising out of cyber-threats has become imperative .
In terms of the circular on Basic Cyber Security Framework for Primary ( Urban ) Cooperative Banks frame a Cyber Security Policy covering guidelines on organisational arrangements , creating cyber security awareness among all stakeholders , ensuring protection of customer information and implementing basic Cyber Security Controls .
The policy also mandated the need to have Inventory Management of Business IT Assets , Environmental Controls , Network Management and Security , Secure Configuration , User Access Control / Management , Vendor / Outsourcing Risk Management and Awareness Building for Users / Employee / Management in a time bound manner .
A supervisory reporting framework has also been prepared for the UCBs to report any unusual cyber security incidents ( including intrusion attempts ) to the Reserve Bank .
The mandate of the Department of Non-Banking Supervision ( DNBS ) is to protect depositors and customers , while ensuring financial stability .
Deposit taking NBFCs , depending upon their systemic importance , are subjected to close on-site and off-site monitoring .
For ensuring customer protection , the Reserve Bank formulated a Fair Practices Code for NBFCs in 2006 .
The mandate to maintain financial stability is ensured through close supervision of systemically important NBFCs ( i.e. , with asset size of ₹ 5 billion and above ) , currently 276 in number and accounting for 85 per cent of the asset size of the sector .
All four pillars of supervision ( viz . , on-site examination ; off-site surveillance ; market intelligence ; and annual certificate received from statutory auditors ) are used for monitoring deposit taking NBFCs and NBFC-ND-Sls .
In the context of electronic transactions and their surveillance , monitoring of cyber security related incidents in the NBFC sector has gained traction and has been centralised in the Cyber Security and Information Technology Examination ( CSITE ) cell of the DBS with effect from April 1 , 2019 .
All NBFCs have been advised to report all types of unusual cyber security related incidents in a specified format to the CSITE cell of the DBS through a generic e-mail id ( cybersecuritynbfc @ rbi.org.in ) .
As part of the efforts to weed out non-compliant weak NBFCs , Certificates of Registration of 1604 NBFCs were cancelled for non-fulfilment of the criterion of the minimum net owned fund requirement of ₹ 20 million .
In preparation of the implementation of Ind AS , a seminar on the subject was conducted at Mumbai in February 2019 .
Concerted efforts would be made during 2019-20 towards further strengthening each of the four supervisory pillars of NBFCs .
Inspection of all regulated entities ( i.e. , banks / NBFCs ) will be conducted together to facilitate better understanding of intra / inter-group transactions and exposures and to obtain a holistic view of an NBFC which has other NBFCs / banks in the same group .
The concept of Senior Supervisory Manager , as the central point of contact for a single large NBFC / group of NBFCs , will be implemented for focussed attention on large entities / groups .
In addition , system of on-site inspection and off-site surveillance mechanism is being strengthened and a review of the supervisory / regulatory framework of CICs would be undertaken keeping in view the need for close monitoring of ClCs , which tap funds from the market and invest in / lend to the group companies .
Off-site returns for NBFCs are being revised and rationalised from 21 to 17 returns , while deepening and widening the information set being obtained .
The returns are being developed in XBRL , with in-built validation checks .
Various reports have been designed to check timely submission of data along with accuracy of reporting as well as to pick up early warning signals of weakness in the regulated entity .
The Sachet portal was launched in 2016 in two languages ( Hindi and English ) for reporting unauthorised collection of deposits / Ponzi Schemes .
The portal will be made available in 11 regional languages in 2019-20 in addition to Hindi and English , which are already available .
This will facilitate receipt of information on Ponzi Schemes and deposit collection by unauthorised bodies .
It will also help in spreading financial literacy as the portal also contains material on financial literacy in many languages .
A template will be designed for SAs to enable them to directly upload the audited data to the Reserve Bank ' s database through XBRL , which will also provide a benchmark for comparing off-site data submitted by NBFCs .
DNBS would work towards development of the fifth pillar of supervision i.e. , engagement with stakeholders of the sector , including the NBFCs , their SAs , CRAs , other regulators and banks having large exposures to the sector so as to , inter alia , identify the emerging risks and developments in the sector and take prompt action .
The enforcement policy and framework approved by the Board for Financial Supervision ( BFS ) emphasises the need to be objective , consistent and non-partisan in undertaking enforcement ( Box VI.6 ) .
Enforcement action has a deterrent effect in terms of money and reputation for the regulated entity ( RE ) and the demonstration effect of an enforcement action has been well documented .
A balanced approach to enforcement involves elements of both , with persisting / recurring non-compliance attracting exemplary formal action .
In the United States , the Federal Deposit Insurance ( FDI ) Act and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) Rules and Regulations , Financial Institutions Reform , Recovery , and Enforcement Act ( FIRREA ) , 1989 and US Civil Code are some of the laws that regulate the financial sector .
Supervisory and enforcement powers are divided between various agencies at the federal and state level and four agencies , viz . , Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( Federal Reserve ) , FDIC , Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) .
Monetary penalties can be imposed on significant institutions and less significant institutions by ECB or by the NCAs depending on the nature of breach ( of EU Law , ECB regulation and decisions or national law ) , up to twice the amount of the profits gained or losses avoided because of the breach , or up to 10 per cent of the significant institution ' s total annual turnover in the preceding business year , based on the principles of effectiveness , proportionality and dissuasiveness , taking into account severity of the infringement and also any aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case .
The period of limitation ( from the date of infringement ) within which the decision to impose penalty is to be taken as well as the period within which the penalty is to be recovered is also provided by the Regulation .
The Reserve Bank has the powers to impose penalties under the various laws affecting the banking and financial sector .
While the Reserve Bank has been taking penal action under these statutes , the process was spread across various supervisory / regulatory departments and was not in line with the international best practice of separating enforcement action from the supervisory process .
Accordingly , with a view to separate identification of violations and enforcement action from supervisory process , and to put in place a sound framework and process for enforcement action and undertake enforcement , Enforcement Department ( EFD ) was set up within the Reserve Bank in April 2017 .
The objective of the policy is to engender greater compliance with statutes and regulations / directions issued by the Reserve Bank thereunder , within the overarching principle of ensuring financial stability , public interest and consumer protection .
Fact of the violation is determined on the basis of the existence of statutory provision and directive / guideline issued thereunder and violation thereof .
Seriousness of the violation is determined on the basis of the amount involved in the violation in an absolute number or as a proportion to business size .
Aggravating factors like repeat / persisting violations and false compliance , if any , are also factored in to determine materiality .
The process of enforcement action entails issuance of a show cause notice to the RE and providing it with a reasonable opportunity of being heard , in writing , and also , if requested , orally .
A three member Committee adjudicates the matter and issues to the RE a reasoned speaking order , indicating therein the enforcement action being taken and the reasons therefor .
While the maximum amount that can be levied as penalty for a violation has been stipulated in respective statutes , the amount of penalty to be imposed in each case within that limit is assessed on its merits based on the principle of proportionality , intent and mitigating factors , if any .
The penalty imposed is payable by the RE within the period specified in the respective statutes .
The Reserve Bank is not empowered to entertain any appeal against or review the order of the Executive Directors ' Committee ( EDC ) , except in cases where monetary penalty has been imposed under the SARFAESI Act , 2002 .
The Enforcement Policy and Framework , which was developed in the background of the Department ' s mandate to undertake enforcement action against commercial banks , will be taken up for revision in the light of the extension of its mandate to undertake enforcement action against cooperative banks and NBFCs .
The Consumer Education and Protection Department ( CEPD ) was formed to , inter alia , frame policy guidelines to ensure protection of interests of consumers of the regulated entities , undertake oversight of the functioning of the Ombudsman schemes of the Reserve Bank and also strive for spreading education / awareness among the general public about safe banking practices , extant regulations on customer services and protection and avenues for redressal of customer complaints .
In continuation of its efforts , the Reserve Bank implemented the OSDT on January 31 , 2019 in all the existing offices of the Banking Ombudsman ( BO ) .
The Scheme was launched under Section 18 of the Payments and Settlement Systems Act , 2007 .
The Ombudsman for digital transactions handles complaints of customers of non-bank issuers of Prepaid Payment Instruments ( PPIs ) authorised / regulated by the Reserve Bank .
The Scheme provides a cost-free and expeditious grievance redressal mechanism aimed _ at resolution of complaints through mediation / conciliation on lines of the Banking Ombudsman Scheme ( Box VI.7 ) .
Offices of NBFC Ombudsman are functioning from the four metro centres-Chennai , Kolkata , Mumbai and New Delhi ; each handling complaints of customers of NBFCs from South , East , West and North zones , respectively .
The scheme was _ initially made applicable to deposit taking NBFCs registered with the Reserve Bank and subsequently widened to encompass NBFC-NDs _ having customer interface and asset size of ₹ 1 billion and above , the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies of April 4 , 2019 .
In June 2019 , the Reserve Bank rolled out the CMS which is a web based software that helps customers of regulated entities to lodge their complaints online and track their status .
In terms of Clause 11 ( 1 ) of the Scheme , the BO endeavours to promote settlement of complaints by agreement between the complainant and the bank through conciliation or mediation .
The BO tries to arrive at settlement based on documentary evidence and written submissions .
However , in case there is a need for a meeting with the bank and the complainant for an amicable solution , the BO holds conciliatory meetings .
These meetings generally start from mediation and move towards conciliation if the solution is not reached .
The CMS has an advanced MIS which can be used as policy input for improving consumer protection as well as supervisory / regulatory interventions , if any .
The functioning of then IO mechanism , mandated by the Reserve Bank in 2015 , was revisited and the | O Scheme , 2018 was formulated under Section 35A of BR Act , 1949 with a view to strengthening the internal grievance redressal system in banks .
It covers all SCBs ( other than RRBs ) with more than 10 banking outlets in India .
The scheme has been implemented from September 3 , 2018 .
An increasing number of maintainable complaints received in the offices of BOs are being disposed through mutual settlements and agreements , up from 35.93 per cent ( 18,031 complaints ) in 2015-16 to 70.5 per cent ( 64,171 complaints ) in 2018-19 .
The Ombudsman Scheme for NBFCs , 2018 and the Ombudsman Scheme for Digital Transactions , 2019 have been formulated on the lines of the BO Scheme , 2006 .
In these Schemes too , the Ombudsman endeavours towards resolution of complaints through conciliation .
The survey findings will indicate the adequacy / inadequacy of the mechanism and the need for further interventions will be considered , if any .
During 2018-19 , the Reserve Bank conducted country-wide awareness campaigns through print and electronic media on various topics such as fictitious offers , BSBDA , banking facilities for senior citizens and differently- abled persons and safe digital banking .
The Reserve Bank ' s SMS handle ' RBISAY ' was also extensively used for sending text messages on such topics across India .
An Interactive Voice Response System was made available to the public for obtaining information in these and other awareness initiatives of the Reserve Bank .
During the year , the offices of BO also conducted 259 Town Hall / awareness / outreach programs , mainly in Tier II cities .
Grievance redressal is an important part of consumer protection framework .
Deposit insurance contributes to the stability of the financial system by protecting the interests of depositors and ensuring public confidence ( Box VI.8 ) .
As on March 31 , 2019 , the number of registered insured banks stood at 2,098 , comprising 157 commercial banks ( including 51 RRBs , 3 LABs , 7 PBs and 10 SFBs ) and 1,941 cooperative banks ( 33 state cooperative banks , 364 DCCBs and 1,544 UCBs ) .
With the current limit of deposit insurance in India at ₹ 0.1 million , the number of fully protected accounts ( 2,000 million ) at end-March 2019 constituted 92 per cent of the total number of accounts ( 2,174 million ) , as against the international benchmark of 80 per cent .
In terms of amount , the total insured deposits of ₹ 33,700 billion as at end-March 2019 constituted 28.1 per cent of assessable deposits of ₹ 120,051 billion , as against the international benchmark of 20 to 30 per cent .
At the current level , insurance cover works out to be 0.8 times of per capita income in 2018-19 .
The DICGC builds up its Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) through transfer of its surplus , i.e. , excess of income ( mainly comprising premiums received from insured banks , interest income from investments and cash recovery out of assets of failed banks ) over expenditure ( payment of claims of depositors and related expenses ) each year , net of taxes .
This fund is available for settlement of claims of depositors of banks taken into liquidation / amalgamation .
Four cooperative banks were liquidated during the year , for which the claim list of depositors are yet to be received .
The National Housing Bank ( NHB ) was set Bank Act , 1987 , as an apex institution for housing finance .
The primary function of NHB is to register , regulate and supervise HFCs .
However , in the Union Budget 2019-20 , Government of India has proposed to shift the regulatory power over HFCs from NHB to the Reserve Bank .
In addition , NHB provides refinance to HFCs , SCBs , RRBs and cooperative credit institutions for housing loans and also undertakes direct lending ( project finance ) to borrowers in the public and private sectors .
Around 60 per cent engage in contingency planning in one form or other .
Out of twenty-three jurisdictions for which information is available , around two-thirds of respective resolution authorities have implemented a Recovery and Resolution Planning ( RRP ) framework .
The RRP is under development in a few risk / loss minimisers such as Chinese Taipei , Korea and ( project finance ) to borrowers in the public and private sectors .
Over the years , NHB ' s focus has been on providing financial support to housing programmes for unserved and underserved segments of the population .
In India , the DICGC functions primarily as a pay box entity i.e. , reimbursing the depositors of failed member banks , although it has some role in resolution through the provision of financial support to depositors of weak banks that merge with strong banks .

The entire capital of NHB amounting to ₹ 14.5 billion was divested Government of India .
In pursuance of the objectives of debt management of cost minimisation , risk nutigation and market development , the Reserve Bank successfully conducted the market borrowing programmes of the centre and states during 2018-19 in the face of global spillovers , volatile financial markets and perceptions of oversupply of paper among the market participants .
The Internal Debt Management Department ( IDMD ) of the Reserve Bank manages the domestic debt of the central government vide Sections 20 and 21 of the RBI Act , 1934 , and that of 29 state governments and the Union Territory of Puducherry in accordance with bilateral agreements as provided in Section 21A of the Act .
The Reserve Bank also provides short-term credit up to three months to both central and state governments in the form of Ways and Means Advances ( WMA ) to bridge temporary mismatches in cash flows , as laid down in Section 17 ( 5 ) of the RBI Act , 1934 .
The rest of the chapter is arranged as follows : section 2 presents implementation status of agenda for 2018-19 both for central and state governments .
Section 3 covers major initiatives to be undertaken in 2019-20 to bring improvement in the debt management of central and state governments .
The market borrowing programme was conducted under a debt management strategy that was geared around cost minimisation , risk mitigation and market development , amidst challenging domestic and global economic and financial conditions .
In particular , market demand for securities was impacted by the reduction in securities maintained in the Held to Maturity ( HTM ) category and in Statutory Liquidity Ratio ( SLR ) requirements , volatility in financial markets , elevated crude prices and monetary policy normalisation in major economies .
Furthermore , the combined gross market borrowing of central and state governments during 2018-19 increased by 4.2 per cent over the previous year to ₹ 10,493 billion , imparting an upside push to yields .
Continuing with the strategy of consolidation , 206 out of 212 issuances of Government of India ( Gol ) securities were re-issuances as against 156 re-issuances out of the total 159 issuances a year ago .
Seven tranches of switch operations of Gol securities were also conducted during 2018-19 under which securities worth face value ₹ 280.6 billion were switched to a longer tenor as compared with ₹ 580.8 billion in the preceding year .
The budget for buybacks was reduced to zero in the revised estimates for 2018-19 as against buyback of ₹ 415.6 billion carried out in the previous year .
The centre refrained from its usual strategy of front loading ' of issuances and instead , shifted borrowing to H2 of 2018-19 .
Accordingly , the borrowing programme of the centre and state was co-ordinated to even out the pressure on yields .
In order to meet the diverse needs of investors and to align Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities ( STRIPS ) with market requirements , revised guidelines on STRIPS was issued on May 3 , 2018 .
Restrictions on the securities eligible for Stripping / Reconstitution as well as the requirement of authorisation of all requests for Stripping / Reconstitution by Primary Dealers ( PDs ) were removed .
Currently , all fixed coupon securities issued by the Gol , irrespective of the year of maturity , are eligible for Stripping / Reconstitution , subject to the criteria that the securities are reckoned as eligible for the purpose of SLR and they are transferable .
Issuances of new government securities ( G-sec ) of 2 years { ( 6.65 per cent GS 2020 ) and ( 7.00 per cent GS 2021 ) } and 5 years { ( 7.37 per cent GS 2023 ) and ( 7.32 per cent GS 2024 ) } in addition to longer tenor Floating Rate Bonds ( FRBs ) were undertaken during the year in order to broaden the investor base .
A new 7-year security was issued in April 2019 for the purpose of creating benchmark in the yield curve .
Furthermore , FRB 2031 was issued in the 10-14 years maturity bucket in May 2018 and barring a few months of the year , it was re-issued in alternate weeks , subject to the limits set in the Medium-Term Debt Strategy ( MTDS ) .
The share of FRBs in total issuances stood at 9.1 per cent vis-a-vis 10.2 per cent a year ago .
An Inter-Departmental Group reviewed the activities of the Standalone PDs with a view to expanding the PD activities and strengthening their network .
As recommended by _ the committee , limited foreign exchange licences were allowed for these PDs vide circular dated made in the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies of June 6 , 2018 .
Under the Foreign Central Bank ( FCB ) scheme , FCBs are considered eligible investors in the G-sec market .
In consultation with the central government , multilateral financial institutions , viz . , New Development Bank ( NDB ) and World Bank entities were included in the scheme during the year .
Further , Treasury Bills ( T-Bills ) were also included as eligible instruments under the scheme .
An agreement was signed with the NDB in February 2019 and the NDB has started investing in G-sec from March 2019 .
Agreements with four World Bank entities - the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( IBRD ) ; the IBRD Trust ; the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency ( MIGA ) ; and the International Development Association ( IDA ) - for investing in G-sec were also signed in April 2019 .
The strategies followed in the issuances during the year helped in elongation of the weighted average maturity ( WAM ) of primary issuance of G-sec to 14.73 years during 2018-19 .
Given the lack of correlation between the spread on State Development Loans ( SDLs ) and issuing states ' fiscal positions , rating of SDLs are being encouraged to reflect differential risks in the cost of borrowing across state governments ( Box VII.1 ) .
Consolidation of various links pertaining to internal and external public debt information and hosting of a single web link on the Reserve Bank ' s website have been undertaken .
Capacity building programmes for state government officials were conducted in five states , viz . , Haryana , Punjab , Uttarakhand , Madhya Pradesh , Gujarat during 2018-19 .
The Union Budget 2018-19 had estimated its gross market borrowing through dated G-sec at ₹ 6,055.4 billion .
However , there appears to be no observable and considerable relationship between borrowing spreads of SDLs and states ' fiscal health , resulting symmetry in bidding patterns and states mobilise funds at similar or near similar yields for the same tenor SDLs ( Table 1 ) .
This may help the market to price risks appropriately and in turn enable efficient price discovery .
For instance , subnationals were given ratings based on debt sustainability factors in Colombia .
Mexico ' s new banking regulations require banks to risk weight credit exposures as per subnational credit ratings and set aside capital as determined by the rating gap between the federal government and the subnational .
In India , as a market development measure , an Automatic Debit Mechanism ( ADM ) was _ introduced for state governments to increase the confidence of investors ; providing a risk-free status to the SDLs .
Measures have also been taken to bring differentiation in valuation of SDLs in the books of the bank as per observed prices in the primary and secondary market given by the Financial Benchmark India Private Ltd . ( FBIL ) .
Other challenges include non-availability of high frequency data , poor quality of financial reporting , accounting system , disclosure standards , and the lack of insolvency systems for subnationals .
From a market perspective , phasing out of ADM facility could be one of the steps which may result in better price discovery of SDLs .
Following the revision of the borrowing programme for H2 of 2018-19 , the Interim Budget 2019-20 , has reduced gross market borrowing through dated G-sec to ₹ 5,710 billion and the net borrowing to ₹ 4,227 billion as against ₹ 5,880 billion of gross borrowing and ₹ 4,484 billion of net market borrowing respectively , in the previous year .
Gross borrowing through Gol dated securities decreased by 2.9 per cent in 2018-19 while the net market borrowing decreased by 5.7 per cent during the same period .
The number of PDs stood at 21 [ 14 bank- PDs and 7 Standalone PDs ( SPDs ) ] at end- March 2019 .
All the PDs maintained Capital to Risk-weighted Assets Ratio ( CRAR ) above the minimum requirement of 15 per cent during the year .
PDs have a mandate of underwriting primary auctions of dated central government securities and achieving bidding commitment / success ratio targets in respect of T-Bills / cash management bills ( CMBs ) .
Underwriting commission paid to PDs during 2018-19 was ₹ 1.40 billion as compared with ₹ 0.61 billion in the previous year reflecting the volatile market conditions .
There were seven instances of devolvement of central government securities on PDs for an amount of ₹ 146 billion in 2018-19 as compared with four instances for ₹ 103 billion a year ago .
The Reserve Bank , in consultation with the Gol , issued six tranches of Sovereign Gold Bonds ( SGBs ) for an aggregate amount of ₹ 5.88 billion ( 1.84 tonnes ) during 2018-19 .
The SGB scheme aims to broaden the investment choice for investors as well as to widen the retail investor base .
A total of ₹ 74.83 billion ( 25.3 tonnes ) has been raised through the scheme since its inception in November 2015 .
The Debt Management Strategy ( DMS ) was introduced in 2015 , in consultation with Gol , to smoothen the government ' s borrowing programme and execute it in a planned manner .
The DMS is reviewed annually and rolled over for the next three years .
According to the current DMS for the period 2018-19 to 2020-21 , in addition to internal debt , small savings schemes and certain aspects of external loans tenure , currency of loans and repayments terms , etc. are brought under the scope of DMS .
The DMS revolves around three broad pillars , viz . , low cost , risk mitigation and market development .
The low cost objective is attained by planned issuances , offer of appropriate instruments in the medium to long-run , and by considering market conditions and preferences of various investor segments , and a detailed issuance calendar for G-sec and T-Bills .
Debt sustainability indicators such as debt-to-GDP , average time to maturity and interest expense to GDP are projected .
Stress tests to measure debt sustainability in the face of economic and financial shocks are also undertaken .
Short-term cash requirements of the government are met through issuance of T-Bills .
The net short-term market borrowing of the government through T-Bills decreased to ₹ 356 billion during 2018-19 as against ₹ 504.8 billion in the previous year .
PDs individually achieved the stipulated minimum success ratio of 40 per cent in bidding for T-Bills .
Their share in T-Bills auctions increased to 71.4 per cent during 2018-19 as compared with 66.5 per cent in the preceding year .
The government started the year 2018-19 with a cash balance of ₹ 1,676 billion .
The WMA limit for the first quarter and second quarter was fixed at ₹ 600 billion and ₹ 700 billion , respectively , while it was ₹ 350 billion during October 2018 to February 2019 , and ₹ 250 billion in March 2019 .
The government ' s cash position remained under stress during the first half of the year , mainly because of high redemption pressures .
Hence , Gol resorted to WMA for 173 days in 2018-19 vis-a-vis 106 days in the previous year , and overdraft ( OD ) for 50 days vis-a-vis 6 days during the same period .
The government also issued CMBs for ₹ 1,900 billion with tenors ranging between 12 to 70 days to tide over short-term mismatches in cash flows .
The Gol ' s cash position improved during H2 of 2018-19 , and ended the year with cash balance of ₹ 1,227 billion .
The WMA limit for the H1 of 2019-20 was fixed at ₹ 750 billion ( Chart VII.1 ) .
States ' dependence on market borrowing has increased significantly over the years , especially since 2017-18 , following the recommendation of the 14 ' Finance Commission ( FC ) to exclude states from the National Small Savings Fund ( NSSF ) financing facility ( barring Delhi , Madhya Pradesh , Kerala and Arunachal Pradesh ) .
The share of market borrowing in financing GFD has increased from 65.8 per cent in 2016-17 to 90.6 per cent in 2018-19 ( BE ) , mainly due to the drying up of other sources of financing .
The gross and net market borrowing of the state governments stood at ₹ 4,783 billion and ₹ 3,486 billion , respectively .
The gross market borrowing of state governments increased by 14.1 per cent , while the net borrowing increased by 2.4 per cent reflecting higher redemptions during the year .
There were 467 successful issuances in 2018-19 , of which 59 were re-issuances , reflecting efforts by states towards consolidation of debt ( Table VII.4 ) .
The weighted average cut-off yield ( WAY ) of SDLs stood at 8.32 per cent , up from 7.67 per cent in the previous year , reflecting the volatile market conditions .
The weighted average spread of SDL issuances over comparable central government securities stood at 65 bps as compared with 59 bps in 2017-18 .
Sixteen states issued non-standard securities of tenors ranging from 2 to 30 years in 2018-19 .
As a strategic response to higher spreads , 11 states rejected all the bids in some auctions .
In its wake , the pandemic leaves a trail of destruction - at the time of release of this Report , it had claimed 7.90 lakh lives , 73.59 lakh active infections and counting out of 2.25 crore confirmed cases worldwide ( as on August 20 , 2020 ) , driven human societies into unfamiliar isolation , halted economic activity globally and extinguished jobs and incomes .
At the first tentative signs of relief - ' green shoots ' being the operative term - people fatigued by asphyxiating social distancing / masks / sanitisers and the ' lockdown syndrome ' have unlocked in varying degrees , desperate to regain control over their lives and livelinood .
In several countries , a renewed surge of infections and deaths has triggered re-clamping down of containment procedures .
It is difficult to distinguish whether the first wave of virus has intensified or if a second wave has hit .
COVID-19 has also hit India hard .
Until recently , six cities - Mumbai ; Delhi ; Ahmedabad ; Chennai ; Pune ; and Kolkata - accounted for half of all reported cases .
India ' s experience has also yielded hope and an innate belief in the unconquerable character of humanity and the institutions that serve it .
While the Reserve Bank of India ' s accounting year is July-June , data on a number of variables are available on a financial year basis , i.e. , April-March , and hence , the data are analysed on the basis of the financial year .
Looking back , global developments in 2019 offer several pensive reflections that have implications for the prospects for India , as for all other economies .
It is now clear that the global economy recoupled in its downturn in 2019 , dispelling the fissiparous movements that seemed to suggest differentiation in growth profiles of constituents in the year before .
Despite these headwinds , some indications emerged toward the closing months of the year that the slowdown may be bottoming out .
One-off factors that had impacted global manufacturing - new emission standards for the auto sector ; inventory accumulation - appeared to fade .
The finance channel was also at work and , intertwined with the confidence channel , amplified global spillovers .
Positive impulses , transmitted through real sector channels described in the foregoing , initially boosted financial markets , and diminished fears of trade war and a hard Brexit supported investors ' risk appetite .
The finance and confidence channels abruptly reversed transmission at the end of 2019 with the onset of COVID-19 .
Financial markets froze , financial institutions started bracing up for a brutal onslaught of balance sheet impairment , extreme risk aversion set in and as incomes stopped flowing , especially to the defenceless , households and businesses alike made a dash for cash .
Turning to domestic developments , the previous year ' s Annual Report posed an existential question : are we dealing with a soft patch , or a cyclical downswing , or a structural slowdown ?
Even as data were being awaited to disentangle the nature of the slowdown , a soft patch was ruled out as the loss of pace became entrenched sequentially with each ensuing quarter .
Going back in time , the Indian economy had experienced a V-shaped recovery from the GFC , but this stimulus-driven upturn failed to sustain : average GDP growth slumped from 8.2 per cent in 2009- 11 to 5.3 per cent in 2011-13 .
From 2013-14 , a cyclical upswing took hold and it turned to be one of the longest in the post-independence period , reaching 8.3 per cent in 2016-17 .
Thus , until the onset of COVID-19 , the moderation in India ' s growth trajectory reflected cyclical forces , both global and domestic .
The global drivers included softer external demand , new automobile emission standards in several parts of the world , weaker macroeconomic conditions because of idiosyncratic factors in a group of systemic EMEs , trade tensions and broader global trade policy uncertainty , the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and the slowdown in China .
The deceleration phase ( Q4 : 2018-19 to Q4 : 2019-20 ) was accentuated by idiosyncratic events such as auto emission norms / axle norms for commercial vehicles and credit events in the NBFC space .
Monetary transmission , typically lagged and incomplete in India , improved significantly in the second half of the year under comfortable liquidity conditions and the mandated linking of the interest rates on new floating rate loans to select sectors to external benchmarks in October .
Illustratively , the weighted average lending rate ( WALR ) on fresh bank loans declined by 71 basis points ( bps ) during February 201 9-February 2020 , of which 31 bps occurred during October 2019-February 2020 .
Fiscal policy had also turned counter- cyclical from Q4 : 2016-17 , with government final consumption expenditure in the form of the 7th pay commission award and one rank one pension providing steady support to GDP .
Circling back to the formation of domestic demand during 2019-20 , consumption turned out to be relatively resilient .
Private consumption , which is the bedrock of domestic demand with a share of 57 per cent of GDP , withstood the overall loss of pace and started decelerating only from Q4 : 2019-20 .
The main drivers of the slowdown in 2019-20 were investment and exports .
A slowdown in fixed investment set in from 2011-12 and became entrenched from Q4 : 2018- 19 , slumping into contraction from Q2 : 2019-20 .
A combination of stress in balance sheets of corporates and banks , defaults in the NBFC sector , slowing income growth of households leading to a large inventory overhang of unsold homes , and the global slowdown weighed heavily on animal spirits .
Underlying the contraction of 5.1 per cent in exports in US dollar terms during the year was a drop in export prices by 4.7 per cent .
For instance , a group of exports - electronic goods ; drugs and pharmaceuticals ; iron ore - held firm in the face of a combination of weakening external demand and country-specific impediments .
Each of these sectors has considerable export potential , especially in the fast-changing dynamics of the international environment .
As regards the evolution of aggregate supply conditions in 2019-20 , agriculture and allied activities provided a silver lining , with record foodgrains and horticulture production and favourable terms of trade for the farm economy .
A perceptible slowdown in the industrial sector has set in after 2015-16 , with its epicentre in manufacturing .
Large gaps in the physical infrastructure have also impacted productivity and overall efficiency .
The services sector has remained the prime mover of the Indian economy over the last three decades .
During the year , several initiatives were undertaken to develop various segments of the financial market spectrum that are under the jurisdiction of the Reserve Bank .
In the foreign exchange market , the focus turned to incentivising access , bridging the segmentation between on shore and off shore activity , simplifying the hedging regime within an overall rationalisation of regulations , and enhancing the ease of doing business in a principles-based regulatory framework .
The development of the debt market was carried forward through liquidity enhancement , expanding the investor base and improving debt management strategies .
In the money market , a revised liquidity management framework was put in place to empower the Reserve Bank to actively manage liquidity Conditions with the use of conventional and unconventional instruments .
Notably , longer term repo operations and special open market operations ( OMOs ) , on top of currency swaps that were launched in 2018-19 , were added to the Reserve Bank ' s arsenal of liquidity management tools .
In the regulatory and supervisory domain , several steps were taken during the year to strengthen financial intermediaries and preserve financial stability .
These initiatives were presented in the Bi-annual Financial Stability Report which monitors the financial system by assessing risks to financial stability through systemic stress tests , financial network analysis and appraisal of the overall regulatory framework .
With regard to the banking system , the ongoing efforts to align the prudential regulatory framework with global standards were carried forward .
The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio ( CRAR ) of SCBs improved to 14.8 per cent in March 2020 ( 14.3 per cent a year ago ) .
The asset-liability management framework for non-banking financial companies ( NBFCs ) was strengthened , including revisions in liquidity risk management to align it with that of the banking sector .
Driven by the Payment and Settlement SystemsVision201 9-21 , efforts were made towards developing efficient and secure payment and settlement systems with focus on the availability of user-friendly platforms at affordable costs .
The Reserve Bank worked towards expanding the reach of Unified Payments Interface ( UPI ) and RuPay cards globally .
Incentives were designed to promote digital payment usage .
Improvements in customer service included availability of National Electronic Funds Transfer ( NEFT ) on 24x7x365 basis , increase in operating hours of Real Time Gross Settlement ( RTGS ) , e-mandates on cards , Prepaid Payment Instruments ( PPIs ) and UPI , expansion of biller categories under the Bharat Bill Payment System ( BBPS ) and enhancing the usage of National Electronic Toll Collection ( NETC ) system .
Turning the page back to the existential question , the available evidence did seem to converge on detecting a cyclical downturn in India - synchronised globally - through 2018-19 and 2019-20 , following one of the longest expansions in recent history .
On this sombre note , it is appropriate to gaze at what lies ahead in 2020-21 and beyond .
After plunging off a precipice in March and undergoing a contraction in the first half of 2020 that is widely regarded as deeper and more destructive than the Great Depression and the GFC , the global economy is starting to break out of the free fall .
In some areas of work such as hospitality , hotels and restaurants , airlines and tourism , employment losses are more severe than in other areas .
The poorest have been hit the hardest .
A defining feature of the COVID-19 experience has been the unprecedented policy response .
According to the IMF , the total stimulus package ( liquidity and fiscal measures ) for G20 countries averaged 12.1 per cent of GDP ( 5.1 per cent of GDP for EMEs and 19.8 per cent of GDP for AEs ) .
The policy fight back has calmed financial markets and even produced asset price inflation out of sync with the underlying state of economic activity , prevented financial institutions and corporations from collapsing , and provided some protection to household incomes .
In its latest update ( June 2020 ) , the IMF has projected global growth at ( - ) 4.9 per cent for 2020 , with a steeply negative impact on economic activity in H1 and more gradual recovery than expected earlier .
India ' s growth is projected at ( - ) 4.5 per cent for 2020-21 .
The projections set out by the OECD on June 10 , 2020 present two scenarios single hit and double hit ' - the latter being one in which a second wave of rapid contagion erupts later in 2020 .
During June 2020 , inter-state e-way bills had increased by 91.3 per cent , but in July they rose only by 15.3 per cent .
Going forward , government consumption is expected to continue pandemic-proofing of demand , and private consumption is expected to lead the recovery when it takes hold , with non-discretionary spending leading the way until a durable increase in disposable incomes enables discretionary spending to catch up .
Urban consumption demand has suffered a bigger blow - passenger vehicle sales and supply of consumer durables in Q1 : 2020-21 have dropped to a fifth and one third , respectively , of their level a year ago ; air passenger traffic has ground to a halt .
Government consumption spending has provided a measure of relief , with central government ' s revenue expenditure , net of interest payments and major subsidies , having risen by 33.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year .
Public finances have , however , been stretched by the imperative to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and headroom for continuing support to aggregate demand may be severely diminished .
Indicators of investment demand - the production of capital goods contracted by 36.9 per cent in June 2020 ( -64.4 per cent in April-June 2020 ) and import of capital goods contracted by 24.7 per cent in July 2020 ( -46.7 per cent in April- June 2020 ) .
Targeted public investment funded by monetisation of assets in steel , coal , power , land , railways and privatisation of major ports by central and state governments under an independent regulator can be ' the way forward to revive and crowd in private investment .
The progress made on building a modern physical infrastructure in the country over the last five years has been noteworthy in the areas of roads , civil aviation and airport connectivity , telecommunication ( including internet and broadband penetration ) , and ports .
India has also recorded an impressive growth in metro rail projects for urban mass transportation .
Nonetheless , the infrastructure gap remains large , needing around US $ 4.5 trillion of investment by 2040 , as per the Economic Survey 2017-18 , with emphasis on upgrading the poor quality of infrastructure .
It is also time to turn to the unlocking of entrepreneurial energies and risk appetite by improving the business environment .
Information and communication technology ( ICT ) has been an engine of India ' s economic progress for more than two decades now .
Exports hold the key to a viable balance of payments and a dynamic manufacturing sector .
Another group of exports in which India ' s competitive edge is progressively being lost to new competition - readymade garments ; gems and jewellery - is traditionally labour-intensive ; regaining competitiveness hinges around labour reforms that unfetter scale economies .
Foreign trade policy should increasingly focus on leveraging exports via free / preferential trade arrangements .
In this context , completion of the India-EU free trade agreement and a post-Brexit free trade agreement / preferential arrangement with the UK may confer early mover advantages .
India also needs to tie up special trade arrangements with countries supplying rare materials that are essential to new export products which are gaining ascendency in the competitiveness ladder .
Designing a _ robust framework for promoting already identified sectors - auto parts ; drugs and pharmaceuticals ; electronics ; textiles ; food processing - to enhance their productivity should be a central feature of the export strategy , alongside exploitation of productivity gains from sectors such as ICT , finance and business services .
For non- ration card holders - particularly migrant labourers , stranded and the needy families - a provision of 8 lakh tonnes of foodgrains has been made under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan package .
Going forward , shifting the terms of trade in favour of agriculture is the key to sustaining this dynamic change and generating positive supply responses in agricultural production .
Second , the Farmers ' Produce Trade and Commerce ( Promotion and Facilitation ) Ordinance , 2020 is aimed at facilitating barrier-free trade in agriculture produce .
Indian manufacturing has been locked in a structural slowdown for quite some time .
The MSME sector has the potential to become the engine of growth , but it has been underperforming for too long owing to various structural reasons .
Over the last two decades , the Indian economy has been driven by the services sector , which comprises a heterogenous group of economic activities with varying degree of skill and organisational requirements across banking and finance , education , healthcare , information technology , tourism , transport , telecom , trade including e-commerce and space .
Apart from generating productivity gains that boost output , the role of services in India assumes importance from the point of view of employment generation as it is the biggest employer with a share of 44.4 per cent ?
During the last three decades , the successes achieved in ICT need to be expanded in other sectors , particularly in healthcare and tourism , where India has an inherent advantage .
This coordinated strategy has kept financial markets and financial institutions functioning normally , alleviated liquidity stress due to the outbreak of COVID-19 , provided households and businesses with confidence by substantially easing financial conditions , and has kept the lifeblood of finance flowing .
In its early August 2020 meeting , the MPC noted the heightened uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic outlook on account of supply chain disruptions and cost push pressures .
It expected headline inflation to remain elevated in Q2 : 2020-21 , but likely to ease in H2 : 2020-21 , aided by favourable base effects .
At the same time , the MPC was conscious of the upside risks to its medium-term inflation target .
With headline inflation ruling above the upper tolerance band around the target , but with economic activity and the outlook remaining weak and uncertain , the MPC noted that the cumulative reduction of 250 basis points was working its way through the economy , lowering interest rates in money , bond and credit markets , and narrowing down spreads .
Accordingly , the MPC decided to stay on hold , while awaiting a durable reduction in inflation to use available space to support the revival of the economy .
Turning to the financial sector , Indian banking has to be liberated from the risk aversion that is impeding the flow of credit to the productive sectors of the economy and undermining the role of banks as the principal financial intermediaries the economy .
The deterioration in the macroeconomic and financial environment is impinging on asset quality , capital adequacy and profitability of banks .
Regulatory dispensations that the pandemic has necessitated in terms of the moratorium on loan instalments , deferment of interest payments and restructuring may also have implications for the financial health of banks , unless they are closely monitored and judiciously used .
The system level CRAR can drop to 13.3 per cent in March 2021 from its March 2020 level under the baseline scenario and to 11.8 per cent under the very severe stress scenario .
Against this backdrop , a recapitalisation plan for public and private sector banks assumes critical importance .
Coming to the NBFC sector , non-traditional and digital players are entering this space to deliver financial services by way of innovative methods involving digital platforms .
In the wake of COVID-19 , lockdowns and the requirement of social distancing are providing an impetus to the wider adoption of digital payments .
The operationalisation of the Payments Infrastructure Development Fund ( PIDF ) is expected to provide the impetus to deployment of acceptance infrastructure across the country , more so in underserved areas , and facilitate digitisation of payment transactions .
Other initiatives include encouraging authorised payment system operators to put in place Online Dispute Resolution ( ODR ) system for failed transactions .
Centralised payment systems , viz , the RTGS system is available for customer transactions from 7 am to 6 pm ; and since December 2019 , the NEFT system operates round the clock - 24x7x365 .
Another objective has been to drive down the cost of digital transactions .
Under ' Utkarsh 2022 ' , which sets out the medium-term strategy of the Reserve Bank consistent with its core purpose , mission and vision , the major deliverables adopted for the year ahead in various functional areas cover a wide canvas .
In the area of regulation and supervision , a specialised cadre will be developed with the requisite skills and expertise , and it will be backed up by a comprehensive supervisory database by linking up existing databases .
Guidelines on securitisation and operational risk will be set out in conformity with Basel Ill standards .
These future strategies will also require the Reserve Bank to be logistically empowered .
The Reserve Bank is in the process of revamping its data warehouse system into a new state-of- the-art Centralised Information Management System ( CIMS ) covering data acquisition to dissemination and _ analytics spread across most business areas of the Reserve Bank .
A Granular Data Access Lab ( GDAL ) has been planned inthe CIMS environment in which techniques of data masking and other access restrictions are envisaged to protect confidentiality of granular data .
The pandemic will inflict deep disfigurations on the world economy .
As in the rest of the world , India ' s potential output can undergo a structural downshift as the recovery driven by stimulus and regulatory easing gets unwound in a _ post-pandemic scenario .
Moreover , this recovery is likely to be different - the GFC occurred after years of robust growth with macroeconomic stability ; by contrast , COVID-19 has hit the economy after consecutive quarters of slowdown .
geographies , escalation of trade tensions between China and the US , uncertainty over Brexit , and heightened geo-political risks , the global economy grew at its slowest pace in 2019 post global financial crisis .
Just as these retarding forces appeared to be easing their grip towards the close of the year , the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) broke out and rapidly exploded into a pandemic , darkening global economic .
As contagion was spreading to over 200 economies across the world , claiming over 59 lakh infections and 3,67,166 deaths worldwide by May 2020 , the release of provisional estimates ( PE ) of national income by the National Statistical Office ( NSO ) at the end of the month revealed that the growth of India ' s real gross domestic product ( GDP ) had slumped to 4.2 per cent in 2019-20 ( 6.1 per cent a year ago ) , the lowest since 2009- 10 .
A downturn that set in during the last quarter of 2016-17 , abstracting from ephemeral base effects in the second half of 2017-18 , caused economic activity to lose speed over eight consecutive quarters to touch a low in Q4 : 2019-20 that has not been seen in the history of the 2011- 12 base series .
Agriculture and allied activities provided a silver lining , on the back of record foodgrains and horticulture production , coupled with resilient allied activities and an outlook brightened by expectations of a normal south west monsoon ( SWM ) in 2020 .
Against this backdrop , this chapeau is followed by component-wise analysis of aggregate demand .
BS VI or Bharat Stage VI , which impacted automobiles and transportation sector , denotes the new emission standard that needs to be complied by all light and heavy vehicles , including two and three wheelers , manufactured on or after April 1 , 2020 .
The May 2020 release of PE for 2019-20 offered a first glimpse at how the economy fared in Q4 : 2019-20 and , therefore , in the year as a whole ; it also brought to bear revisions to estimates for the preceding quarters .
The new release confirmed a 2.8 percentage points reduction in the growth of aggregate demand below its decennial trend rate of 7.0 per cent , and a sequential deceleration from a recent peak of 7.9 per cent in H2 : 2017-18 .
Real GDP growth in H2 : 2019-20 at 3.6 per cent was also the lowest registered in the 2011-12 base series ( Appendix Table 1 ) .
The three-quarter moving average of seasonally adjusted annualised growth rates ( MA-SAAR ) corroborated the weakening of the momentum of demand ( Chart Il.1.1 ) .
Consequently , the negative output gap ( i.e. , deviation of actual output from its potential level ) widened in 2019-20 , pointing to the substantial slack in resource utilisation .
Compositional shifts in demand conditions reflect the anatomy of the persistent slowdown extending into 2019-20 ( Chart Il.1.2 and Appendix Table 2 ) .
Private final consumption expenditure ( PFCE ) , constituting 57.2 per cent of aggregate demand , recorded its lowest growth in a decade .
Nonetheless , at 5.3 per cent in 2019-20 , PFCE growth exhibited resilience in the face of the prolonged weakening of income and financial conditions .
Petroleum consumption remained flat , while non-oil non-gold imports remained in contraction all through the year .
Among indicators of urban demand , passenger car sales contracted throughout 2019- 20 , exacerbated by idiosyncratic factors such as rising insurance costs and tighter emission norms .
Among indicators of rural demand , tractor sales had contracted until the beginning of the rabi sowing season , but record sowing along with improvement in terms of trade for the farm sector revived demand and catalysed a spurt in tractor sales between December 2019 and February 2020 and stayed robust even during the pandemic period .
GFCE compensated for the slowdown in _ private consumption , registering double-digit growth for the third consecutive year in 2019-20 .
The COVID-19 pandemic delivered an unprecedented shock to the economy .
The rate of gross domestic investment in the Indian economy , measured by the ratio of gross capital formation ( GCF ) to GDP at current prices , had declined to 32.2 per cent in 2018-19 .
Because of lockdown , households have to stay at home and therefore , reduce labour supply to firms ; consumption falls due to non-availability of non- essential items and fall in income ; and restricted people-to-people contact stalls the momentum of the pandemic .
Inflation falls under both scenarios mainly because of a fall in demand ; under lockdown II , however , the decline in inflation is less steep and short-lived .
Thus , the economy undergoes a deeper contraction under lockdown Il , but recovery from the pandemic is faster ( Chart 1 ) .
The model is based on both qualitative and quantitative assumptions .
The qualitative assumptions are : ( a ) Households derive utility from consumption and health , and supply labour to the firms and their health deteriorates in proportion to the spread of the pandemic ; ( b ) The spread of pandemic depends on consumption and labour supply decisions of the households ; ( c ) Government declares a lockdown in response to the pandemic that restricts people-to-people contact and hence affects labour supply and consumption demand adversely , but stalls the momentum of pandemic .
The main quantitative assumptions used to calibrate the model are : ( a ) The economy is categorised into contact intensive and non-contact intensive sectors , based on factor shares data of KLEMS - - [ Capital ( K ) ; Labour ( L ) ; Energy ( E ) ; Materials ( M ) ; and Services ( S ) ] ; ( b ) Economic activity is worst hit in the month of April 2020 , as suggested by various high frequency economic indicators ; ( c ) The output gap drops to ( - ) 12 per cent of the potential for this period , based on semi-structural time series analysis ; ( d ) Infections peak in second-half of August 2020 , as indicated by the generalised SEIR epidemiological model ( updated in June ) ; and ( e ) The employment during lockdown drops to around ( - ) 32 per cent of its pre-lockdown level , based on the combined insight from Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy ( CMIE ) and KLEMS employment estimates .
In scenario II , which envisages a second lockdown , the decline in economic activity is expected to reach its trough in Q1 : 2020-21 and growth turns positive from Q4 : 2020-213 ( Chart 3a ) .
Another constituent of GFCF , viz . , construction activity remained subdued in 2019- 20 as a large inventory overhang coupled with stressed liquidity conditions restrained new launches .
This was also reflected in growth of steel consumption , which plunged to a decadal low of 0.9 per cent in 2019-20 and cement production which registered a contraction of 0.9 per cent ( Chart Il.1.3 ) .
Driving the contraction in GFCF during 2019-20 was the collapse in investment in machinery and equipment , as evident in both imports and production of capital goods .
As per the Order Books , Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey ( OBICUS ) of the Reserve Bank , capacity utilisation ( CU ) in manufacturing sector picked up from 68.6 per cent in Q3 : 2019-20 to 69.9 per cent in Q4 : 2019-20 .
On a seasonally adjusted basis , CU remained stable at 68.3 per cent in Q4 : 2019-20 as against 68.4 per cent in Q3 : 2019-20 .
As per the preliminary estimates , household financial saving has improved to 7.6 per cent of GNDI in 2019-20 , after touching the 2011-12 series low of 6.4 per cent in 2018-19 ( Table II.1.2 ) .
COVID-19 related economic disruptions , however , caused a sharper decline in household financial assets in Q4 : 2019-20 .
Aggregate supply , measured by gross value added ( GVA ) at basic prices , slowed to 3.9 per cent in 2019-20 , 2.1 percentage points lower than a year ago and 2.8 percentage points below its decennial rate of 6.7 per cent .
GVA ' s momentum measured by three quarter moving average ( MA ) of quarter-on-quarter ( q-o-q ) seasonally adjusted annualised growth rates ( SAAR ) appears to have troughed in Q3 : 2019-20 and a modest uptick seems to have commenced in Q4 : 2019-20 ( Chart 1.1.4 ) .
These negative tendencies were cushioned by the agriculture sector , as discussed below .
Agriculture and allied activities , with a real GVA growth of 4.0 per cent in 2019-20 ( PE ) , benefitted from record production of foodgrains as well as commercial and horticultural crops .
The contribution of agriculture to overall economic growth ( 15.2 per cent ) surpassed that of the industrial sector ( 4.7 per cent ) for the first time since 2013-14 .
After a rainfall deficit of 33 per cent in June , the SWM gathered momentum from mid-July and cumulative rainfall at the end of the season ( September 30 , 2019 ) turned out to be 10 per cent above the long period average ( LPA ) [ 9 per cent below LPA during previous year ] .
Kharif sowing also gained momentum and ended the season with marginally higher acreage than in the previous year .
Accordingly , kharif foodgrains production in 2019-20 is placed 1.3 per cent higher than the final estimates ( FE ) for 2018-19 .
The maximum loss was in respect of urad , and production estimates were revised downward by 29.2 per cent ( 2 AE over 1 AE ) due to crop losses .
Overall foodgrains production is estimated at 2,966.5 lakh tonnes in 2019-20 - a record for the third successive year .
Foodgrains production is estimated to have grown by 4.0 per cent in 2019-20 , driven mainly by record production of rice and wheat .
Among commercial crops , oilseeds , cotton , and jute and mestia are estimated to have grown by 6.0 per cent , 26.6 per cent and 0.9 per cent , respectively , while sugarcane production contracted by 12.3 per cent over the previous year .
As per the 2 AE , the production of horticultural crops reached a record level of 3,204.8 lakh tonnes during 2019-20 , driven mainly by production of vegetables and _ fruits ( Table II.1.5 ) .
In recent years , the impact of climate change in terms of volatile rainfall intensity , increase in extreme events and rising temperature has implications for the outlook of agriculture ( Box II.1.2 ) .
As in the previous two years , minimum support prices ( MSPs ) announced in 2019-20 for both rabi and kharif crops ensured a minimum return of 50 per cent over the cost of production .
In the Union Budget 2020-21 , the government had proposed to operationalise Kisan Rail for transporting perishable goods ( including milk , meat and fish ) to improve the efficiency of agricultural supply chains , reduce post-harvest losses and moderate price fluctuations .
Further , Krishi Udaan scheme was proposed to help farmers to transport their produce by air on both national and international routes .
This has likely caused a decline in crop yields , undermining farm income ( Chart 2b ) .
This imparts urgency to move from flood irrigation to micro irrigation methods like drip or hose reel , which can save up to 60 per cent of the water used and also help in preventing pest incidence .
At present , the coverage of micro irrigation is much lower in states which have recorded higher declines in water tables ( Chart 3b ) .
Minimum support prices announced for kharif 2020-21 are higher by 2.9 per cent to 12.7 per cent vis-a-vis last year , ensuring a minimum return of 50 per cent over all India weighted average cost of production .
Under Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan Package , government has announced measures to strengthen infrastructure , logistics , capacity building , governance and administrative reforms for agriculture , animal husbandry , fisheries and food processing .
These measures include eight development schemes with fund allocation of ₹ 1.6 lakh crore which is much higher as compared to funds allocated to the relevant schemes for the Union Budget 2020-21 .
In addition to the above schemes , the government has also announced three governance and administrative reforms to attract investments in agriculture sector and make it competitive , namely , delisting of various agricultural commodities from the Essential Commodities Act to develop seamless marketing and promote storage infrastructure in agriculture ; ' The Farmers ' Produce Trade and Commerce ( Promotion and Facilitation ) Ordinance 2020 ' to ensure barrier free trade of agriculture produce ; and ' The Farmers ( Empowerment and Protection ) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance 2020 ' to empower the farmers to engage with processors , aggregators , wholesalers , large retailers , and exporters in a fair and transparent manner ( Annex Il ) .
Industrial GVA decelerated sharply in 2019-20 to 0.8 per cent from 4.5 per cent last year .
The print for 2019-20 was the lowest in the 2011- 12 series , marking the fourth consecutive year of deceleration since 2015-16 .
The deceleration was broad-based with headwinds from subdued demand - both domestic and international .
With dwindling confidence and imposition of lockdown , the demand for non- essential items plummeted .
The index of industrial production ( IIP ) shrank by 0.8 per cent during 2019-20 from 3.8 per cent growth a year ago ( Chart Il.1.7a & 7b ) .
In the manufacturing sector , which constitutes three-fourths of industry , 17 of 23 industry groups recorded contraction .
The motor vehicles segment was the largest negative contributor to manufacturing IIP , while basic metals , largely comprising mild steel slabs , provided a positive impetus .
Estimated through a univariate approach using Hodrick-Prescott filter .
Crude oil and natural gas production declined due to depletion in reserves , flood repairs and industrial strikes , in addition to sluggish demand .
In terms of use-based classification , much of the deceleration in IIP was caused by a sharp contraction in capital goods and consumer durables production ( Table II.1.6 ) .
In terms of weighted contributions to IIP , infrastructure goods , consumer durables and consumer non-durables declined , while that of intermediate goods increased ( Chart II.1.8 ) .
Even as the persisting weakness in capital goods production , and the decline in capacity utilisation have raised concerns in the context of investment slowdown , demand for consumer non- durables has also slumped , suggesting overall weakening of demand conditions ( Chart II.1.9 ) .
The deceleration in manufacturing activity is aggravated by decline in trade due to trade disruptions with the onset of COVID-19 and declining demand .
Accordingly , an import disruption , ceteris paribus , would lead to non-availability of crucial components , resulting in contraction in manufacturing GVA by as much as 2.5 per cent ( Table II.1.8 ) .
The impact due to factor income loss ( capital and labour ) of 68 days of lockdown on the manufacturing and mining sectors could be as high as ₹ 2.7 lakh crore ( Table II.1.9 ) .
In tandem with the slowdown in the industrial sector , services sector growth decelerated to 5.0 per cent in 2019-20 - the lowest in the last three decades .
All sub-sectors except public administration , defence and other services ( PADO ) decelerated , the latter cushioning overall services sector growth , despite revenue shortfalls .
Excluding PADO , services sector GVA growth decelerated to 3.7 per cent from 7.0 per cent in 2018-19 ( Chart II.1.10 ) .
Deceleration in construction and trade , hotels , transport , communication and services related to broadcasting drove the slowdown in overall services activity ( Chart II.1.11 ) .
The sluggishness in the road transport sector was reflected in a contraction in commercial vehicle sales that began since H2 : 2018-19 and intensified through the year .
construction , trade , transport and finance and is a coincident indicator of GVA growth in the services excluding PADO , declined in 2019-20 ( Chart 1.1.12 ) .
In June 2020 , the NSO released the Periodic Labour Force Survey ( PLFS ) of employment for 2018-19 .
The labour force participation rate was estimated at 37.5 per cent in 2018-19 , an increase of 0.6 percentage points from 2017-18 .
The unemployment rate according to usual status declined to 5.8 per cent in 2018-19 ( 6.0 per cent for male and 5.2 per cent for female ) from 6.1 per cent in 2017-18 ( 6.2 per cent for male and 5.7 per cent for female ) .
In terms of distribution of workers by broad status in employment , the share of regular wage / salaried workers increased from per cent in 2017-18 to 23.8 per cent in 2018- 19 , with a corresponding fall in the proportion of casual workers from 24.9 per cent to 24.1 per cent during the same period , indicating enhanced formalisation of the economy .
More updated organised sector employment , measured in terms of payroll data from the Employees ' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) , Employees ' State Insurance Corporation ( ESIC ) and National Pension System ( NPS ) , indicated a mixed picture with regard to job creation in 2019-20 ( Chart II.1.13 ) .
On the other hand , the average number of members who paid their contribution to ESIC contracted by 4.1 lakh during 2019-20 , in contrast to an addition of 0.6 lakh during 2018-19 .
New subscribers to NPS increased marginally during the same period .
For Q4 : 2019-20 , PMI employment index showed payroll hiring in manufacturing gained momentum whereas , for services , the rate of job creation moderated as compared to previous quarter .
Hiring activity measured by online recruitment , showed a mixed pattern .
While Naukri Job Speak Index contracted sharply , Monster Employment Index registered growth during Q4 : 2019-20 ( Chart Il.1.14a ) .
Both the Industrial Outlook Survey ( IOS ) and Consumer Confidence Survey ( CCS ) pointed to the sentiments on employment conditions remaining pessimistic during Q4 : 2019-20 ( Chart Il.1.14b ) .
Considering the small farm size in India , the self-employed in agriculture can be assumed to be relatively unscathed by the pandemic .
On the other hand , 40 per cent of casual labourers in rural areas are employed in the construction sector , which has come to a complete halt during the lockdown ( Table II.1.10 ) .
Self-employed and casual labourers together account for 51.3 per cent of the urban workforce , and hence , the pandemic has disproportionate impact on urban areas .
Several policy initiatives were undertaken by the government during the year for addressing structural bottlenecks in the economy .
These policies are aimed at generating employment opportunities such as strategic promotion of labour-intensive manufacturing , increasing public expenditure on MGNREGA , Prime Minister ' s Employment Generation Programme ( PMEGP ) , Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana ( DDU-GKY ) and Deen Dayal Antodaya Yojana - National Urban Livelihoods Mission ( DAY-NULM ) .
A package of measures was announced in May 2020 under Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan in five tranches cover , among .
These measures aggregate around 20 lakh crore or 10 per cent of GDP and aim to address the difficulties faced by various categories including MSMEs , NBFCs , power distribution measures , both short-term and long-term companies and _ infrastructure projects .
The growth of India ' s personal protective equipment ( PPE ) sector from scratch before March 2020 to making 1,50,000 pieces a day by beginning of May 2020 shows the potential of India in meeting the challenges .
MSMEs which are badly hit by the pandemic are expected to benefit from various policies of the government such as collateral free loan of ₹ 3 lakh crore , subordinate debt provision of ₹ 20,000 crore and equity infusion via mother- fund-daughter fund model .
The structural reforms introduced as part of fourth tranche of stimulus is expected to bring in private investments across eight critical sectors .
To sum up , consumption demand slumped during 2019-20 .
The global inflation environment remained benign through 2019 and the early part of 2020 , engendered by soft commodity prices and massive monetary policy accommodation .
In India too , headline inflation was benign in the first half of 2019-20 , but firmed up in the second half due to a sharp spike in food inflation on a combination of adverse developments , i.e. , the late withdrawal of the monsoon , unseasonal rains and _ supply disruptions .
During December 2019-February 2020 , headline inflation breached the upper tolerance band for inflation mandated for the monetary policy committee ( MPC ) [ Chart II.2.1 ] .
In the event , annual average inflation crossed 4 per cent for the first time since the adoption of flexible inflation targeting ( FIT ) framework in 2016 , amidst accentuated volatility ( Table II.2.1 ) .
April and May 2020 data are imputed by NSO .

Furthermore , kurtosis turned slightly less negative than it was a year ago , suggesting a few instances of large deviations from mean inflation , which was also reflected in the wide gap between maximum and minimum inflation during the year .
Against this backdrop , sub-section 2 assesses developments in global commodity prices and inflation .
Sub-section 3 discusses movements in headline inflation and major turning points , followed by a detailed analysis of the major constituents of inflation in sub-section 4 .
Sub- section 5 discusses other indicators of prices and costs , followed by concluding observations .
International food prices were range- bound during H1 : 2019-20 , but they firmed up from October 2019 , primarily led by wheat ( due to strong international demand ) , maize ( supply uncertainty in the US and Argentina ) , palm oil ( lower supply and rising demand for biodiesel in producing countries ) , meat ( demand from China ) and fish prices ( Chart II.2.2 ) .
Prices of some food items like rice and wheat were , however , supported by stockpiling by consumers in regions affected by COVID-19 .
Despite OPEC + reaching an agreement to cut oil production by about 10 mbpd ( about 10 per cent of global supply ) in early April , crude oil prices continued to fall on COVID-19 induced slump in demand and exhaustion of storage capacity .
Subsequently , crude prices did recover to around US $ 42.8 per barrel in July 2020 , but remained far below pre-COVID-19 levels .
Reflecting these global commodity price developments and weak demand conditions , consumer price inflation remained benign during 2019 and early 2020 in a number of economies .
Core consumer price inflation was low in advanced economies ( AEs ) , despite robust job growth .
Many emerging market and developing economies ( EMDEs ) also experienced easing of inflation due to subdued economic activity , although some pressures from rising food prices were visible .
With the outbreak of COVID-19 and consequential lockdown bringing global economic activity to near standstill , many economies resorted to monetary and fiscal measures to ward off recessionary tendencies and provide support to growth .
After trending below the target of 4 per cent during the first half of 2019-20 , headline inflation spiked during the second half and reached a multi-year peak of 7.6 per cent in January 2020 ( highest in 68 months ) [ Chart 1.2.3 ] .
Fuel prices recorded five consecutive months of deflation during July-November 2019 , before bouncing back during December 2019- March 2020 on the pressures from international prices of LPG and kerosene .
For the year as a whole , inflation picked up to average 4.8 per cent in 2019-20 , 136 basis points ( bps ) higher than a year ago ( Appendix Table 4 ) .
Constituents of CPI headline inflation exhibited distinct shifts during 2019-20 ( Chart II.2.4 ) .
Inflation in prices of food and beverages ( weight : 45.9 per cent in CPI ) leaped from 1.4 per cent in April 2019 to 12.2 per cent in December 2019 .
Additionally , cyclonic storms and unseasonal rains resulted in supply disruptions and damage to kharif crops , primarily vegetables and pulses , during December- January 2019-20 ( Chart II.2.5 ) .
In addition , unseasonal rains during September- October 2019 damaged the kharif onion crop in major producing states of Maharashtra , Madhya Pradesh , Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh , escalating prices from September 2019 .
Onion price inflation skyrocketed to 327.4 per cent in December 2019 .
Potato prices also picked up throughout the year ( barring September 2019 and February 2020 ) , primarily due to untimely and excess rains , which damaged crops ready for harvest and disrupted supplies to mandis .
Consequently , potato price inflation reached an all-time high of 63 per cent in January 2020 , after emerging out of 7 months of continuous deflation in November 2019 .
In the case of tomato prices , inflation peaked at 70 per cent in May 2019 and remained in high double digits till December 2019 , due to delayed harvesting in Maharashtra and fungus-damaged crops in Karnataka , coupled with the supply disruptions referred to earlier in key supplier states - Karnataka , Maharashtra and Himachal Pradesh .
Tomato prices , however , moderated during November 2019 - February 2020 , in line with the usual seasonal pattern .
Prices of cereals and products ( weight of 21 per cent in the CPI-Food and beverages ) also witnessed a build-up in upside pressures during 2019-20 ( Chart II.2.7 ) , rising almost continuously from 1.2 per cent in April 2019 to around 5.3 per cent during January-March 2020 .
In the case of wheat , inflation averaged around 6.5 per cent during the year , capped by higher procurement which also economised on imports ( 31.4 per cent lower in 2019-20 ) .
Non-PDS rice prices emerged out of 11 months of deflation in October 2019 on account of positive price pressures and unfavourable base effects to reach an inflation level of 4.2 per cent in January 2020 , in the wake of higher procurement and damages to the kharif crop , but they moderated to 3.9 per cent in February 2020 .
Milk and products prices ( weight of 14.4 per cent in the CPI-Food and beverages ) were another pressure point during the year ( Chart 11.2.8 ) .
In the case of pulses ( weight : 5.2 per cent in CPI-Food and beverages ) , 2019-20 began with the end of a prolonged deflation of 29 months in May 2019 .
Additionally , a decline in kharif pulses production ( by 4.6 per cent as per 4 Advance Estimates for 2019-20 over 2018-19 Final Estimates ) , especially urad production ( by 44.9 per cent ) , added to inflation persistence ( Chart 11.2.9 ) , despite imports being higher by around 14.6 per cent during 2019-20 .
Inflation in protein-rich items such as eggs and meat and fish ( weight : 8.8 per cent in CPI- Food and beverages ) averaged 4.5 per cent and 9.3 per cent , respectively the highest in the last six years and together , they contributed 13.7 per cent of overall food inflation during the year .
Meat and fish prices reflected higher feed prices , especially of maize and soybean .
With the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 , however , the consumption of poultry slumped and prices moderated during February-March 2020 .
Among other major food items , sugar and confectionery , and oils and fats also contributed positively to overall food inflation , reflecting a decline in domestic production in the case of the former and higher international prices in respect of the latter .
Prices of fruits ( weight of 6.3 per cent in the CPl-food and beverages group ) emerged out of nine months of deflation in September 2019 but prices generally remained soft in the rest of the year .
Prices of spices , especially of dry chillies and turmeric , registered significant pressures due to a reduction in the area under production .
The contribution of the fuel group ( weight of 6.8 per cent in CPI ) to headline inflation decreased to 1.9 per cent in 2019-20 from 11.3 per cent in the previous year .
Fuel inflation eased sequentially from April to June 2019 and moved into deflation during July-November 2019 , pulled down by favourable base effects and muted price pressures in major fuel items ( Chart II.2.10 ) .
Domestic LPG prices , which rose during April- June 2019 , sank into deflation in July 2019 , tracking the collapse in international LPG prices with a lag ( Chart II.2.11 ) .
Firewood and chips inflation picked up during December 2019 to February 2020 on the back of strong price pressures on winter demand .
Domestic LPG prices also moved out of deflation in January 2020 , in line with the upward movement in international LPG prices .
Overall , headline inflation was subjected to higher volatility in 2019-20 relative to the previous four years , underpinned by high flux in food prices ( Charts II.2.14a & b ) .
Within the food group , price spikes for different items occurred at different time points .
Empirical analysis for the period January 2011 and February 2020 suggests that seasonal behaviour has changed in the case of prices of many food items such as , onions , ginger , brinjals , cauliflowers , okras and green peas .
There is no evidence of persistence of volatility in prices of items such as petrol , diesel and precious metals , although these items also contribute to volatility in headline inflation .
During 2019-20 , sectoral CPI inflation based on the consumer price index of industrial workers ( CPI-IW ) remained elevated and reached 9.6 per cent in December 2019 ( highest in 73 months ) , primarily due to housing and food prices .
Inflation based on the consumer price index of agricultural labourers ( CPI-AL ) and the consumer price index of rural labourers ( CPI-RL ) , which do not have housing components , also increased during the year and reached 11.1 per cent and 10.6 per cent , respectively , in December 2019 ( highest in 72 months ) before easing thereafter , on softening of food prices and favourable base effects .
Inflation , measured by the wholesale price index ( WPI ) , remained subdued during 2019-20 .
It reached an intra-year low of zero per cent in October 2019 ( lowest in 40 months ) due to deflation in prices of non-food manufactured products and fuel and power .
It picked up during November 2019-January 2020 , however , driven by a sharp uptick in prices of primary articles and unfavourable base effects , before moderating to 0.4 per cent in March 2020 due to softening in the prices of all three major groups , i.e. , primary articles , fuel & power and manufactured products .
On an annual average basis , WPI inflation softened to 1.7 per cent in 2019-20 from 4.3 per cent in 2018-19 .
After major increases in minimum support prices ( MSPs ) during 2018-19 for kharif and rabi crops , MSPs witnessed a moderate hike in 2019- 20 .
The extent of MSP increases varied across crops , ranging from 1.1 per cent in the case of moong and nigerseed to 9.1 per cent for yellow soybean .
MSPs of rice and wheat were increased by 3.7 per cent and 4.6 per cent , respectively .
Wage growth for agricultural and non- agricultural labourers generally remained subdued during the year , averaging around 3.4 per cent , and reflecting the slowdown in the construction sector .
In the corporate sector , pressures from staff costs remained moderate during the year .
In sum , headline inflation picked up strongly during the closing months of 2019-20 and the short-term outlook for food inflation has turned uncertain .
Global crude oil prices have started firming modestly in more recent weeks .
Disruptions in food and manufactured items ' supply chains could amplify sectoral price pressures , thus posing an upside risk to headline inflation .
The volatility has been estimated through asymmetric threshold GARCH model proposed by Glosten , Jagannathan and Runkle ( 1993 ) .
Monetary and credit conditions moderated through 2019-20 reflecting the weakening of underlying economic activity , with inflation remaining benign in the first half of the year before spiking on food price pressures in the later months .
The rate of money supply ( M3 ) slackened as deposit growth moderated .
Towards the close of the year , the slowing of deposit growth became accentuated as COVID-19 impelled a flight to cash .
In terms of the sources of money supply , credit growth slumped to half its rate a year ago , reflecting weak demand and risk aversion among banks .
Contra-cyclically , reserve money ( RM ) expansion , adjusted for first round effects of cash reserve ratio ( CRR ) changes , was _ broadly maintained at the preceding year ' s rate , bolstered by a build-up of net foreign assets ( NFA ) of the Reserve Bank and its monetary policy operations in consonance with the accommodative policy stance adopted since June 2019 - open market purchases ; reduction in the CRR ; special market operations ( in the form of long-term repo operations and targeted long-term repo operations ) ; and USD / INR swaps .
These developments engendered abundant liquidity in the system which eased liquidity premia in the midst of strong discrimination by financial markets on credit risk concerns .
Against this backdrop , sub-section 2 delves into the dynamics underlying movements in RM and , thereby , into the role of the Reserve Bank ' s balance sheet in the larger context of the state of the economy .
This section also analyses the impact of COVID-19 on currency in circulation .
Sub-section 3 examines developments in money supply in terms of its components and sources , throwing light on the behaviour of assets and liabilities of the banking sector .
The underpinnings of bank credit evolution during the year have been covered in sub-section 4 .
This is followed by concluding observations and some _ policy perspectives .
Drilling into the unravelling of reserve money changes during the year reveals interesting behavioural shifts .
Among components , the expansion in RM was driven by currency in circulation ( CiC ) - 120 per cent of the RM expansion during the year .
At the end of March 2020 , CiC constituted around 81 per cent of RM .
The demand for CiC normally follows a defined intra-month pattern expansion during the first fortnight due to transactions by households , followed by a contraction in the second fortnight due to flow back of currency from households to the banking system ( Chart II.3.2 ) .
In the following quarter , CiC contracted due to seasonal slack of economic activity in cash-intensive sectors such as construction and agriculture .
Thereafter , CiC expanded , reflecting rise in currency demand for kharif harvest and festivals in Q3 and the harvest of rabi crops during Q4 .
The year ended with a surge in pandemic-related rush to cash .
Overall , CiC growth of 14.5 per cent was slightly lower vis- a-vis 16.8 per cent a year ago ( Chart II.3.3 ) ;
There was an unusual rise in month-over- month ( M-o-M ) CiC variation during March-June 2020 vis-a-vis the corresponding period in previous years ( Chart II.3.5 and Chart II.3.6 ) .
Amongst sources of RM , net domestic assets ( NDA ) and NFA have alternated in determining RM growth ( Chart II.3.8 ) .
Consistent with the accommodative stance of monetary policy set out in June 2019 , the Reserve Bank ensured comfortable liquidity conditions , augmenting its liquidity management toolkit with unconventional instruments .
Net open market purchases of ₹ 1.1 lakh crore resulted in an increase in net Reserve Bank credit to the government by ₹ 1.9 lakh crore , which became the main driver of NDA in 2019-20 .
Among other constituents of NDA , net claims on banks ' and the commercial sector ( mainly PDs ) , reflected mainly net LAF absorption aimed at Sterilising forex operations and managing the large overhang of liquidity in the system ( Chart II.3.9 ) .
The net LAF position was in repo mode during April-May 2019 , but turned into reverse repo mode for the remainder of the financial year ( Chart II.3.10a and Chart II.3.10b ) .
M3 , comprising currency with the public ( CwP ) , aggregate deposits ( AD ) and other deposits with the Reserve Bank , averaged 10.2 per cent for the first three quarters of 2019-20 ( 10.1 per cent a year ago ) , before dropping off sharply in February and March 2020 to end the year at 8.9 per cent ( Chart II.3.11 ) .
From the components side , M3 expansion was contributed by AD , its largest constituent ( 86 per cent ) , led mainly by time deposits - AD accounted for 78 per cent of the increase in M3 during the year .
The flight towards cash and a concomitant drawdown on demand deposits was particularly visible in the last quarter of 2019-20 , in the wake of uncertainities related to COVID-19 pandemic .
Bank credit to the commercial sector , followed by net bank credit to the government and net foreign exchange assets of the banking sector , led the expansion in M3 .
With non-SLR investments of banks also decelerating , commercial banks augmented their SLR portfolios ,
Growth of NFA of the banking sector mirrored NFA in RM .
The money multiplier declined to 5.5 by end-March 2020 from 5.6 a year ago , converging towards its decennial average level ( 2010-19 ) of 5.5 .
Adjusted for reverse repo , however , analytically akin to banks ' deposits with the central bank - the money multiplier turned out to be lower at 4.8 by end-March 2020 , reflecting the deceleration in the rate of money supply below its secular trend ( Chart II.3.15 ) .
Linking this phenomenon of money deposit ratio was 3.8 per cent ( 4.5 per cent last creation process to the dynamics of economic activity , empirical analysis ' considering data from Q1 : 2010 to Q4 : 2019 suggests that the money multiplier adjusted for reverse repo could be a lead indicator for gauging the movement of economic activity .
Also , the money multiplier adjusted for reverse repo appears to be a better indicator , capturing the recent dynamics of economic activity more closely than the unadjusted money multiplier .
The currency-deposit ratio at 16.3 per cent at end-March 2020 moved above its decennial average ( 2010-19 ) of 15.1 per cent .
During the year , the pace of expansion in currency and a rise of the currency-deposit ratio pointed to a shift in public ' s preference towards holding cash in response to the uncertainty caused by the pandemic .
With the statutory requirements for CRR and statutory liquidity ratio ( SLR ) , at 3 per cent and 18 per cent , respectively , around 79 per cent of deposits were available with the banking system as on end-March 2020 for credit expansion .
The moderation in the credit-deposit ratio to 76.4 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 77.7 per cent a year ago was largely a reflection of subdued demand conditions in the economy due to several factors examined subsequently .
The credit-deposit ratio , which measures the demand for credit relative to funding available in the banking system , underwent four distinct phases since independence .
nationalisation phase to the post-nationalisation phase , and subsequently , the reform phase starting from early 1990s followed by movements dictated by upturns and downturns in growth cycles .
These movements also reflected changes in statutory requirements for CRR and SLR .
The average credit-deposit ratio of 72 per cent during the first two post-independence decades fell to 69 per cent during the next two decades as deposit growth gained momentum with the geographic spread of banking services , and further to 55 per cent during 1990-2004 due to phases of subdued credit demand .
Subsequently , the average credit- deposit ratio increased to 75 per cent during 2005- 20 on the back of a credit boom ( 2005-14 ) , and supportive economic growth conditions ( Chart II.3.17 ) .
Credit offtake from SCBs was muted during 2019-20 , growing at 6.1 per cent y-o-y ina sharp loss of pace from 13.3 per cent a year ago and from a recent peak of 15.0 per cent in December 2018 .
Credit demand has been ebbing away across all sectors , despite the post-IL & FS shift among large borrowers , including non-banking financial companies ( NBFCs ) and housing finance companies ( HFCs ) , away from non-bank sources and towards the banking system for meeting funding requirements .
The unabated weakening of economic activity , coupled with deleveraging of corporate balance sheets and risk aversion by banks due to asset quality concerns , was accentuated towards the close of the year by the pandemic woes ( Chart II.3.18 ) , producing a reduction in the incremental credit-deposit ratio ( Chart II.3.19 ) .
The credit-to-GDP gap remained wide during 2019 , reflecting the slack in credit demand ( Chart II.3.20 ) .
With a nation-wide lockdown and people mostly remaining indoors , amidst fear and uncertainty , the usage of cash witnessed an abnormal rise ( Chart II.3.21 ) .
The Reserve Bank undertook expansionary monetary policy measures to ensure the availability of adequate liquidity in the system .
COVID-19 has imparted scars on monetary and credit aggregates towards the end of the year ( Box II.3.1 ) .
Data on sectoral deployment of bank credit for March 2020 point to a broad-based slowdown .
Credit growth to agriculture and allied activities , and industry - mainly large and medium units - decelerated in 2019-20 .
Cross-country monetary statistics ( IMF , 2020 ) indicate that the increase in currency in circulation was particularly sharp in Brazil , Chile , India , Russia and Turkey , as also in advanced economies such as the US , Spain , Italy , Germany and France , where the use of cash is less ( Chart 1 ) .
The rise in currency in circulation in these countries occurred concomitantly with liquidity injecting measures undertaken by their central banks .
They were also impacted by the COVID-19 build-up of precautionary balances .
Rising uncertainty reduces the willingness of businesses to invest money and generate employment opportunities whereas , on the other hand , it reduces consumer spending ( Ahir , et al . 2020 ) .
A spurt in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in India deposit growth that had commenced from February 2020 , essentially reflecting a ' dash to cash ' under extreme uncertainty ( Chart 4 ) .
By contrast , bank credit , which had decelerated continuously during the year , has remained largely stable through the COVID-19 outbreak despite sharp contraction in activity levels .
Reflecting these developments , the credit-deposit ( C-D ) ratio increased from 75.8 per cent at end-January 2020 to 76.4 per cent at end-March 2020 , led by the increased demand for cash for transactions as digital payments declined .
Credit growth to food processing , basic metal and metal products and infrastructure contracted ( Table II.3.2 & Chart II.3.22a ) .
Credit growth to infrastructure contracted during 2019-20 , mainly due to reduction in offtake by the power segment and deceleration in credit flows to the roads and _ telecommunications segments .
Credit to the services sector decelerated sharply , primarily driven down by slowdown in credit growth to NBFCs , on account of concerns relating to the health of the sector .
There was also a sharp deceleration in credit to the trade segment .
Personal loan growth decelerated moderately .
Housing loans , which constitute the largest segment of personal loans , witnessed a moderate deceleration , along with credit cards outstanding .
However , there was an acceleration in growth of vehicle loans during the year .
Among bank groups , credit growth by public sector banks ( PSBs ) decelerated sharply to 3.4 per cent in March 2020 from 10.2 per centa year ago , reflecting stress from impaired balance sheets .
Credit growth by private sector banks also decelerated to 13.9 per cent in March 2020 from 17.5 per cent a year ago , mainly attributable to deceleration in credit growth to the services sector ( Chart II.3.22a and Chart II.3.22b ) .
To sum up , even as monetary and credit conditions moderated through 2019-20 , COVID-19 led to an unusual surge in currency demand , along with deceleration in aggregate deposits .
Credit growth weakened during the year , with deceleration in all major sectors .
The Reserve Bank pro- actively managed liquidity conditions through conventional and unconventional measures to augment system-level liquidity .
Figures in parentheses indicate growth rates in June 2019 over June 2018 .
Going forward , surplus liquidity conditions , coupled with policy rate reductions , are expected to instill confidence , easing financial conditions and incentivising the flow of funds at affordable rates so as to rekindle investment and lay the foundations of strong sustainable growth as the COVID-19 curve flattens and the economy repairs and revives .
Global financial markets , which traded on a buoyant note during most part of 2019 and early 2020 , experienced panic sell-offs across asset classes , triggered by the outbreak of COVID-19 .
In the money market , as detailed in sub-section 2 , overnight money market rates ( call money , triparty repo , and market repo ) were largely aligned with the policy rates albeit with a downward bias , and were insulated from adverse global developments by proactive liquidity management by the Reserve Bank .
Bond yields softened significantly during 2019-20 as discussed in sub-section 3 , aided initially during H1 : 2019-20 by positive sentiments from the general election results , policy rate cuts , infusion of liquidity by the Reserve Bank and the possibility of the fiscal deficit slippage being contained .
The money market remained generally stable during 2019-20 , especially in H1 .
In the second half of the year , bouts of volatility , mainly in March 2020 on account of the spread of COVID-19 , dispelled the calm .
Beginning June 2019 , liquidity conditions transited gradually out of deficit conditions during Q1 : 2019-20 .
The Reserve Bank proactively managed frictional liquidity conditions with a slew of conventional liquidity measures , viz . , reduction in the CRR and easing of daily maintenance requirements , variable and fixed rate repos / reverse repos of various tenors and access to the Marginal Standing Facility ( MSF ) as well as several unconventional measures , including long- term repo operations ( LTRO ) , targeted long-term repo operations ( TLTRO ) , line of credit to financial institutions , and a special liquidity facility for mutual funds ( MFs ) .
The weighted average call rate ( WACR ) in the unsecured inter-bank call money market remained aligned with the policy repo rate during the year with a downward bias ( Chart II.4.1 ) .
The average absolute spread of the WACR over the policy rate increased to 11 basis points ( bps ) in 2019-20 from 9 bps in 2018-19 , as surplus liquidity conditions prevailed in the banking system for most of the year .
Volatility in the call money segment , measured by the coefficient of variation of the WACR , , increased to 7.55 in 2019-20 from 3.40 a year ago , reflecting the swings liquidity conditions .
The triparty repo and market repo rates remained below the WACR , on average , by 22 bps each .
Average daily volume in the money market ( call money , triparty repo and market repo taken together ) increased by 16 per cent to ₹ 2,42,658 crore during 2019-20 from ₹ 2,09,152 crore in 2018-19 .
In the call money segment , average daily volumes decreased by 17 per cent during the year to ₹ 16,558 crore , reducing its market share to 7 per cent from 9 per cent in the previous year .
The traded volumes in both secured and unsecured money market segments increased in recent months , in spite of COVID-19 .
Interest rates on longer tenor money market instruments , viz . , 91-day Treasury Bills ( T-bills ) , certificates of deposit ( CDs ) and commercial papers ( CPs ) generally moved in sync with the policy repo rate during 2019-20 .
The spread of CD rates over T-bill rates narrowed in Q3 : 2019-20 to 21 bps from 39 bps in Q2 ; however , it widened to 48 bps in Q4 following the outbreak of COVID-19 and the usual year-end balance sheet phenomenon ( Chart II.4.2 ) .
G-sec yields hardened in April 2019 in response to the Reserve Bank maintaining a neutral monetary policy stance contrary to market expectation , sustained higher crude oil prices following the US announcement of stopping of imports from Iran and supply disruptions in Libya and Venezuela , and depreciation of the Indian rupee ( INR ) .
Market sentiment was buoyed further by the MPC ' s decision to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 bps to 5.75 per cent on June 6 , 2019 coupled with the change in policy stance from neutral to accommodative .
Notwithstanding a larger than expected policy rate cut of 35 bps by the Reserve Bank , rollback of surcharge on _ foreign portfolio investments ( FPls ) and higher than expected surplus transfer by the Reserve Bank , market participants remained wary in August and September with the yield hardening by 19 and 14 bps , respectively , on concerns over fiscal slippage and geo-political tensions following the attack on Saudi oil refineries .
In Q3 : 2019-20 , G-sec yields moved in a narrow range during October-November 2019 , before hardening in the first fortnight of December 2019 .
However , the Reserve Bank ' s decision to conduct special OMOs on December 19 resulted in a decline in the benchmark yield by 5 bps ( as compared to December 16 , 2019 ) .
Overall , the G-sec yield declined by 11 bps in Q3 : 2019-20 ( Chart II.4.3 ) .
The yield on benchmark 10-year G-sec closed at 6.14 per cent at the end of 2019-20 , reflecting the impact of Reserve Bank ' s operations ( Box II.4.1 ) .
Following Swanson , et al . , ( 2011 ) , a high frequency event study analysis was conducted around the announcement day of the Reserve Bank ' s special OMOs in the nature of " Operation Twist ( OT ) . "
Overall , twenty such ' large surprise ' policies are identified between 2014 and 2019 , including the policy announcement of December 5 , 2019 .
The forecasted path is then compared with the observed path of the yield ( Chart 1 ) .
The result suggests that the 10-year G-sec yield would have been higher without the two OT announcements in December 2019 .
PI limits are revised on a half yearly basis under the medium-term framework ( MTF ) , with the objective of ensuring a more predictable regime for investment by the FPI .
Accordingly , investment limits for FPI in G-sec including State Development Loan ( SDLs ) were increased in a phased manner from ₹ 3,27,900 crore as on April 6 , 2018 to ₹ 3,95,200 crore as on April 1 , 2019 .
The outflow was pronounced in the fourth quarter , particularly in March 2020 that witnessed an outflow of ₹ 48,279 crore , in line with other emerging market economies ( EMEs ) hit by the outbreak of COVID-19 .
Corporate bond yields largely tracked G-sec yields .
The yield on 5-year AAA-rated corporate bonds softened during 2019-20 , reflecting reduction in the policy repo rate , surplus systemic liquidity conditions , and the impact of special OMOs and LTRO auctions conducted during the latter part of the year .
The risk premia or spread ( 5-year AAA- rated bond yield over 5-year G-sec yield ) on bonds issued by public sector undertakings ( PSUs ) , financial institutions ( Fls ) and banks ; NBFCs ; and corporates fell by 58 bps , 34 bps and 14 bps , respectively .
The average daily turnover in the corporate bond market increased to ₹ 8,532 crore during 2019-20 from ₹ 7,587 crore a year ago ( Chart II.4.4 ) .
Primary corporate bond issuances increased by 6.6 per cent to ₹ 6.9 lakh crore during 2019-20 as softening of yields encouraged corporates to mobilise higher resources from the corporate bond market , particularly public sector entities .
Private placements remained the preferred choice for corporates , accounting for 97.8 per cent of total resources mobilised through the bond market .
In order to provide an alternative source of financing for public sector entities at lower cost and help deepen bond markets by diversifying investor base with increased retail participation , the Government of India ( Gol ) launched the Bharat Bond Exchange Traded Fund Chart II.4.4 : Turnover in Corporate Bond Market § Daily Turnover in Corporate Bonds Spread of PSUs , FIs and Banks ( RHS ) Spread of Corporates ( RHS ) Spread of NBFCs ( RHS ) Source : SEBI and Bloomberg .
Outstanding corporate bonds increased by 6.1 per cent y-o-y to ₹ 32.5 lakh crore or 16.0 per cent of GDP at end-March 2020 .
Investments by FPls in corporate bonds decreased to ₹ 1.73 lakh crore at end-March 2020 from ₹ 2.19 lakh crore at end-March 2019 .
The Indian equity market , which reached slide thereafter and trimmed its gains during 2019- 20 , especially after the outbreak of COVID-19 .
Volatility soared to unusually high levels .
Overall , the BSE Sensex and the Nifty 50 plummeted by 23.8 per cent and 26.0 per cent , respectively , over end-March 2019 .
However , prospects of a stable government and expectations of further monetary easing by the Reserve Bank buoyed market sentiment driving the BSE Sensex to 40,000 levels in June 2019 .
The downtrend deepened in July 2019 over the Budget proposals such as ( i ) tax on super rich ; ( ii ) buyback tax ; and ( iii ) increase in minimum public shareholding in listed companies .
However , the rollback of the super-rich tax on FPIs , front-loading of capitalisation of public sector banks and deferment of a hike in registration fees for automobiles provided some support to market sentiment .
The BSE Sensex rose by five per cent on announcement of a reduction in the corporate tax rate .
Furthermore , global tailwinds due to the US Fed ' s dovish outlook , the US-China Phase-1 trade deal and Brexit-favouring UK _ election outcome aided the upswing .
A slew of positive macroeconomic developments thereafter , including fall in global crude prices , recovery in industrial output in November , higher GST collections and expansion in manufacturing Purchasing Managers ' Index ( PMI ) for December , drove the BSE Sensex to close at a record of 41,953 on January 14 , 2020 .
Markets wilted , however , under escalating geo-political tensions between the US and Iran , a weak domestic GDP growth outlook along with downward revision of India ' s growth forecast for 2019-20 by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and higher CPI inflation print for December 2019 .
However , markets made a V-shaped recovery on February 4 , 2020 on the back of a sharp fall in crude oil prices and release of robust manufacturing PMI data for January 2020 .
Beginning February 20 , 2020 , fears over COVID-19 induced slowdown reverberated across the globe as equity markets both in advanced and EMEs , including in India , witnessed panic sell- offs .
The BSE Sensex fell by 2,919 points ( 8.2 per of COVID-19 as pandemic by the WHO .
The market lost further ground with the BSE Sensex falling over 10 per cent during early hours of trading , attracting circuit breakers and suspension of trading for 45 minutes .
A statement from SEBI indicating that the fall in the Indian stock indices has been significantly lower than in many other countries and assuring market participants of suitable and appropriate actions , if required , helped calm market nerves with the BSE Sensex points ( 4.0 per cent ) , the largest ever recovery in a single day .
However , these gains could not be sustained as bearish sentiment returned on the back of continued moderation in global crude prices and growing worries over the impending recession .
The Indian equity market breached the lower circuit bound for the second time in a month , with the BSE Sensex recording its biggest fall of 3,935 points ( 13.2 per cent ) on March 23 , 2020 .
Markets regained some lost ground thereafter amidst expectations of fiscal measures by the government , announcement of comprehensive monetary , liquidity and regulatory measures by the Reserve Bank including a sizeable reduction in policy rates on March 27 , 2020 .
However , it is observed that over the last few years , domestic institutional investors ( DIls ) are increasingly emerging as a counter balancing force to FPls during stress situation .
During March 2020 , when FPIs were net sellers to the tune of ₹ 62,434 crore , Dlls , led by MFs and insurance companies , were net buyers to the tune of ₹ 55,595 crore , thereby largely counter- balancing the withdrawal by FPls .
Further , the correlation between monthly net investments of MFs and FPls during 2019-20 came out as high as -0.9 , suggesting a strong counter balancing force during the time of FPI sell-ofts .
The market capitalisation of companies listed on BSE declined by 27 per cent to ₹ 113.5 lakh crore at end-March 2020 from ₹ 155.5 lakh crore at end-December 2019 , before recovering to ₹ 129.4 lakh crore at end-April 2020 .
Hence , market capitalisation at end-March 2020 stood at 55.8 per cent of GDP as compared with 77.9 per cent at end-December 2019 .
Heightened volatility in domestic financial markets was caused by panic selling by FPls ( Box II.4.2 ) .
To comprehend the overall financial conditions , a Financial Conditions Index ( FCI ) was constructed using Principal Component Analysis on twelve indicators across different market and IT have outperformed the overall market ( Chart 2 ) .
The values of the FCI above zero indicate higher-than-average levels of financial market stress / tightened financial conditions , while values below zero indicate lower-than-average levels of stress / loose financial conditions .
Financial conditions eased subsequently in response to various liquidity measures undertaken by the Reserve Bank ( Chart II.4.6 ) .
Net investment by DIls , particularly MFs , provided support to the equity market during 2019- 20 .
While MFs were net buyers to the tune of ₹ 91,160 crore , FPls were net sellers of ₹ 6,204 crore , in the Indian equity market ( Chart II.4.7 ) .
FPlIs made net purchases of ₹ 63,509 crore during September 2019 to February 2020 , but they made net sales of ₹ 62,434 crore during March 2020 as the spread of COVID-19 triggered flight to safety .
The primary segment of the equity market witnessed increased activity during 2019-20 .
Resource mobilisation through initial public offers ( IPOs ) , follow-on public offers ( FPOs ) and rights issues jumped more than four-fold to ₹ 76,382 crore during 2019-20 .
Of these , ₹ 21,323 crore were mobilised through 60 IPO / FPO issues , out of which 46 issues amounting to ₹ 495 crore were listed on the Small and Medium Enterprises ( SME ) platform of the BSE and the NSE .
Resource mobilisation through rights issues amounted to ₹ 55,059 crore mostly by telecom companies .
Resource mobilisation through qualified institutional placement ( QIP ) also increased sharply to ₹ 51,216 crore in 2019-20 from ₹ 10,289 crore in 2018-19 ( Appendix Table 5 ) .
Net resources mobilised by mutual funds declined by 20.4 per cent to ₹ 87,301 crore in 2019 -20 .
Assets under management of equity-oriented mutual funds declined by 32.4 per cent to ₹ 6.0 lakh crore at end-March 2020 from ₹ 8.9 lakh crore at end-March 2019 .
In the foreign exchange market , turnover in both merchant and the inter-bank segments of the spot and forward market mostly remained at the previous year ' s levels , while the swap segment exhibited an increase in activity during the latter part of the year .
The Indian rupee traded with a weakening bias , tracking other EME currencies during 2019- 20 , touching a then lifetime low against the US dollar in March 2020 .
While the depreciation of rupee was modest during H1 : 2019-20 - it depreciated by 2.31 per cent against the US dollar - mainly due to a sell-off in the equity market during July-August 2019 amidst concerns over escalating US-China trade tensions and tepid global growth .
However , the rupee came under intense pressure since then , triggered by flight to safety by FPIs on weakening of growth and COVID-19 concerns .
It touched an all-time intra- the Indian rupee depreciated by 8.88 per cent against the US dollar during 2019-20 , it performed better than other EME currencies .
In tandem with movements in the nominal exchange rate of the rupee , the 36-currency nominal / real effective exchange rate ( NEER / REER ) remained range-bound during 2019-20 , barring a sharp depreciation in both 36-currency NEER and REER in August 2019 and March 2020 .
On average , the 36-currency NEER and REER appreciated by 0.9 per cent and 2.4 per cent , respectively , during 2019-20 on a y-o-y basis .
Forward premia softened across the tenors during the year under the downward pressure exerted by the substantial increase in banking system liquidity .
However , the near-term premia edged higher in the February-March period as rupee demand increased ahead of end-year closure of accounts .
Going forward , financial market movements would hinge to a large extent on the progress made in containing the COVID-19 pandemic .
Measures taken by the government and the central bank in addressing the macroeconomic and financial fallout of COVID-19 would also play an important role in shaping the behaviour of financial markets .
For the central government , the overshoot of 1.3 percentage points in its gross fiscal deficit ( GFD ) was mainly due to lower than budgeted tax collections , reflecting the growth slowdown as well as rationalisation of corporate tax rates .
Thus , the central government took recourse to the escape clause under Section 4 ( 3 ) of the revised FRBM Act twice in 2019-20 - first , for its GFD being placed at 3.3 per cent of GDP in the budget estimates ( BE ) ( 0.2 percentage points above the glide path specified in 2018-19 ) on account of GST stabilisation and second , for the GFD overshooting to 3.8 per centin its revised estimates ( RE ) .
As per provisional accounts ( PA ) , however , the central government ' s realised GFD reached 4.6 per cent .
Against this backdrop , sub-sections 2 and 3 present the position of central government finances in 2019-20 and 2020-21 , respectively .
Sub-sections 4 and 5 outline the developments in state government finances during 2019-20 and 2020-21 , respectively .
General government finances are discussed in sub-section 6 .
The final section sets out concluding remarks and some policy perspectives .
In 2019-20 , the provisional accounts ( PA ) indicate that the central government ' s GFD recorded a slippage of 1.3 percentage points from the target set in the Union Budget .
Estimates for gross tax revenue in 2019-20 were brought down by ₹ 4.51 lakh crore vis-a-vis BE .
On a year-on-year ( y-0-y ) basis , direct taxes declined by 7.7 per cent in 2019-20 ( PA ) as against a 13.4 per cent increase in 2018-19 , whereas indirect tax growth decelerated to 1.7 per cent from 2.9 per cent a year ago .
Moreover , only about half of the budgeted disinvestment target of ₹ 1.05 lakh crore was achieved .
While capital expenditure was close to the budget target , revenue expenditure was curtailed to 96.0 per cent of the budgeted level , primarily through rollover of food subsidy .
The Union Budget 2020-21 attempts to balance the dual imperatives of providing countercyclical support to growth and charting a return to the FRBM ' s prescribed fiscal deficit path ( Table II.5.1 ) .
The consolidation in 2020-21 budget is to be achieved through higher non-tax revenue , led by spectrum auction and usage charges budgeted at ₹ 1.3 lakh crore .
Moreover , non-debt capital receipts have also been budgeted higher , on the back of disinvestment receipts of ₹ 2.1 lakh crore , almost four times of what was realised in 2019-20 ( Chart II.5.1 ) .
Going by the principle of using latest available GDP data for any year , GDP used for 2019-20 ( RE ) is the latest available Provisional Estimate ( released on May 29 , 2020 ) .
In view of this , the fiscal indicators as per cent of GDP given in this Table may at times marginally vary from those reported in the Union Budget Documents .
An important goal of the Budget is reforms in the areas of labour , investment , coal and mining , which could revive economic activity and impart buoyancy to revenues .
As per the information available for 25 state governments , the consolidated fiscal position of states - in terms of the GFD-GDP ratio - deteriorated to 2.8 per cent in 2019-20 ( RE ) vis-a- vis BE of 2.3 per cent ( Chart II.5.3 ) .
This deviation was mainly caused by the economic slowdown leading to lower revenue - both own and central transfers .
Under own tax revenue , the decline was pronounced in states ' goods and services tax ( SGST ) and taxes on vehicles , which induced cuts in capital expenditure .
Under revenue expenditure , allocation to development expenditure was increased , while non-development expenditure was reduced .
The reduction in capital expenditure was largely reflected in reduced spending towards rural development .
For 2020-21 , states budgeted a consolidated GFD-GDP ratio of 2.3 per cent , expenditure .
The increase in revenue is expected from higher own tax revenue and devolution of tax .
The reduction in expenditure is likely to be more under spending on education , social security and welfare , relief on account of natural calamities , other agricultural programmes and energy .
While higher capital spending is budgeted in education , medical and public health , and urban development , spending on energy and transport is expected to be curtailed .
Based on information of 25 states , the general government fiscal deficit increased from 5.4 per cent of GDP in 2018-19 to 6.5 per cent in 2019-20 ( RE ) .
Outstanding liabilities also increased to 70.4 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 ( RE ) from 67.5 per cent in 2018-19 .
However , based on _ provisional accounts information , the general government fiscal deficit ( including all states ) is expected to deteriorate further to about 7.5 per cent in 2019-20 .
Thus , the fiscal gains achieved in the previous two years were reversed in 2019-20 .
A caveat is that most of the estimates for 2020-21 were worked out before the nation-wide lockdown .
Given the shortfall in revenues - a direct fallout of subdued economic activity and increased expenditure requirement to fight the pandemic - the general government fiscal deficit and debt are likely to be materially higher than budgeted .
In sum , the deterioration in major deficit indicators in 2019-20 may be attributed to tax revenue shortfall , both cyclical and structural .
At the same time , a _ significant curtailment expenditure was justifiably avoided in view of the economic slowdown , which got accentuated from the second half of 2018-19 .
Meeting the fiscal targets budgeted in 2020-21 has become even more challenging due to COVID-19 , in view of containment measures and fiscal interventions for providing health infrastructure , helping vulnerable sections of the society and sector- specific relief measures .
In this scenario , it is desirable to have a clear exit strategy with credible consolidation milestones and _ timelines in reworking the path towards fiscal rectitude in the coming years .
Developments in the external sector during 2019-20 mirrored the unusual interplay of weak domestic and external demand , terms of trade gains from falling international crude prices and surges in net capital inflows .
Against this backdrop , sub-section 2 presents a brief overview of global economic and financial conditions followed by an analysis of merchandise exports and imports in sub-section 3 .
Sub-section 4 delves into the behaviour of invisibles .
In January 2020 , the _ international environment began to improve with expectations of a US-China Phase 1 trade deal and an orderly Brexit .
International organisations such as the IMF and the World Bank projected a recovery in global growth and trade for 2020 and 2021 .
The loss of output , employment and life itself across 200 countries brought the global economy to standstill .
This triggered a wave of downward revisions to global output growth , with the IMF projecting a contraction of world GDP by 4.9 per cent and trade volume by 11.9 per cent in 2020 .
The contraction in advanced economies ( AEs ) is projected to be more severe at 8.0 per cent while for the emerging markets and developing economies ( EMDEs ) , it is milder at 3.0 per cent .
In fact , the OECD projected a sharper contraction of 7.6 per cent , in case a second wave of COVID-19 hits before the year end .
The impact on trade is expected to occur through various channels , including supply-chain disruptions , adoption of restrictive trade policies , volatility in international commodity prices , after- effects of lockdowns and lower demand resulting from the projected global recession .
According to the WTO ' s forecast of April 2020 , world merchandise trade volume may plummet by 13 to 32 per cent during 2020 .
On the other hand , gold prices increased , reflecting safe-haven demand by investors amidst heightened global uncertainty .
Inflationary pressures faced by EMDEs eased due to weaker demand and the sharp decline in oil prices .
Global financial markets were buffeted by bouts of volatility amid investor concerns about downside risks to global growth accentuating towards the end of 2019-20 .
With the onset of the pandemic and growing fear of a deeper recession , global financial conditions tightened abruptly with a sharp fall in asset prices in EMEs as investors rushed to safety and liquidity .
Central banks across the world have cut policy rates and pumped massive amounts of liquidity into markets through various conventional and unconventional measures , supplementing governments fiscal efforts to mitigate the fallout of COVID-19 .
As per the WTO , global merchandise trade growth dropped to 0.1 per cent in volume terms in 2019 , after growing by 2.9 per cent in 2018 .
India ' s merchandise exports and imports contracted by 5.1 per cent and 7.8 per cent , respectively , during 2019-20 , after three successive years of growth .
Notwithstanding a marginal appreciation of the rupee in real effective terms - a measure of trade competitiveness - the estimated export volume remained more or less constant in 2019-20 vis-a-vis 2018-19 , but falling export prices caused a decline in value terms .
The deterioration in exports performance was broad-based - commodity groups constituting more than four-fifths of the export basket recorded lower values of shipments .
The worsening profile of key export items , i .e. , engineering products , gems and jewellery , petroleum products , rice , and cotton textiles was sector-specific , amplified by global developments ( Chart II.6.1 ) .
Exports of items such as electronic goods , drugs and pharmaceutical and iron ore proved resilient and recorded expansion .
The fall in exports of petroleum , oil and lubricants ( POL ) was largely driven by the softening of international crude oil prices , which plunged by 12.9 per cent during the year following the failure of the OPEC in reaching an agreement with Russia on production cuts and the resulting oversupply in global oil markets ( Chart II.6.2 ) .
According to the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell ( PPAC ) of the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas , crude oil processed by refineries witnessed a decline of 1.1 per cent ( y-o-y ) , reflecting the closures of domestic refineries to meet the International Maritime Organisation ( IMO ) 2020 bunker fuel specifications as well as Bharat Stage ( BS ) VI emission norms which entailed supply of less polluting fuel across the country from April 1 , 2020 .
Rice exports declined due to non-basmati rice turning uncompetitive vis-a-vis other major exporters like China , Thailand , Vietnam and Pakistan , on account of the rise in minimum support price ( MSP ) of paddy .
Gems and jewellery exports contracted by 10.8 per cent in 2019-20 on top of a decline of 3.1 per cent a year ago on account of the rise in import duty on precious stones and sluggish import demand from key destinations .
Engineering goods registered a decline of 5.9 per cent during 2019-20 as against a growth of 6.3 per cent a year ago .
All major components , except electrical machinery and equipment ( which accounted for around 11 per cent of total engineering goods exports ) , registered contraction .
In particular , auto components and parts , ships , boats and floating structures , non-ferrous metals and products thereof , and industrial machinery were the key contributors to the decline .
Destination-wise , the USA , which accounts for 16 per cent of India ' s engineering goods exports , registered just 0.2 per cent growth .
Exports of cotton textiles registered a decline of 10.6 per cent during 2019-20 as against a growth of 9.3 per cent a year ago .
Electronic goods exports , which account for 3.7 per cent of total exports , grew continuously for 25 straight months since February 2018 , driven by a rise in exports of telephone instruments , including smartphones ( Chart II.6.3 ) , and expanded by 32.5 per cent during 2019-20 .
Though India is not a significant player in the global smartphone market which is dominated by China , Vietnam and Hong Kong , it has the potential to play a crucial role in this market due to huge domestic demand and the rise of its digital economy .
Drugs and pharmaceuticals exports grew by 8.1 per cent during 2019-20 .
lron ore exports picked up during 2019-20 on the back of a sharp increase in global iron ore prices , following production outages in Brazil .
Nearly 80 per cent of total iron ore exports from India are shipped to China , which is the largest steel producer in the world .
More than two-thirds of world trade passes through global value chains ( GVCs ) which straddle at least one border before final assembly .
COVID-19 has posed challenges to GVCs as companies across the globe have significant exposure to Chinese GVCs ( Box II.6.1 ) .
The slowdown in India ' s merchandise imports that commenced in the second half of 2018-19 deepened further in 2019-20 , with imports declining by 11.3 per cent in Q2 : 2019-20 as compared with an increase of 22.8 per cent in Q2 : 2018-19 .
Contraction in imports at the rate of 11.2 per cent set in during Q3 : 2019-20 .
COVID-19 accentuated the decline and imports fell by 9.8 per cent in Q4 : 2019-20 .
For the year as a whole , imports shrank by 7.8 per cent ( Chart II.6.7 ) .
Indian industry ' s integration with top 10 trading partners across 15 key sectors ( which account for around three- fourths of India ' s exports ) can be measured through the Grubel-Lloyd Index ( GLI ) .
Sector-wise and country-wise analysis suggests that intra- industry trade diversification may be strengthened with the Euro area , Indonesia and USA with regard to the automotive industry ; with the Euro area , the USA , the UAE and Hong Kong for electrical machinery ; and with Hong Kong , the USA , Indonesia and the UAE for precision instruments ( Table 1 ) .
Aggregation at the sectoral level has been made by using bilateral trade shares ( UNCTAD , 2020 ) .
Since several countries are looking to diversify away from China , this also provides a unique opportunity for India ( Reynolds and Urabe , 2020 ; Chaudhary , 2020 ) .
Strengthening the domestic manufacturing sector ' s participation in global value chains , liberalising trade , investments and FDI policy with regard to developing infrastructure ( both hard and soft ) , providing reliable intellectual property rights for the international investor and implementing labour market reforms hold the key to India ' s emergence as an important player in GVCs , going forward .
In volume terms , however , imports remained stable in 2019-20 while import unit value declined by 8.6 per cent in 2019-20 as against a growth of 4.8 per cent a year ago .
A few sectors , such as cotton , pulses , pharmaceutical products , and fruits and vegetables weathered the downturn and witnessed an expansion in imports during 2019-20 .
Imports of POL shrank by 7.4 per cent during 2019-20 on the back of a decline in international crude oil prices by 12.9 per cent ( Chart II.6.8 ) .
Low global oil demand and expansion in production from non-OPEC countries such as the US and Canada limited upsides to international crude prices emanating from supply- side disruptions in Saudi Arabia , falling production of OPEC and the US sanctions on Iran and Venezuela .
The Risk Monitoring Department ( RMD ) is the nodal Department for the formulation and operationalisation of ERM in the Reserve Bank .
A portfolio-based credit value at risk / expected shortall ( VaR / ES ) model would be developed as an additional risk monitoring / reporting tool , with the objective of facilitating effective oversight of credit risk ( Utkarsh ) [ para XI.41 ] ; and
A stress testing framework would be developed for robust assessment of the Reserve Bank ' s credit risk ( Para X1.42 ) .
The risk tolerance statement articulated by the Committee of the Central Board ( CCB ) provides an overarching guidance for setting the risk tolerance limits ( RTLs ) .
A structured process has been put in place for formulation of RTLs and risk reporting framework .
As part of the phased implementation of the risk tolerance framework , the process of review of the existing risk tolerance limits , in line with internally articulated risk tolerance stance , is currently underway for some of the market departments .
Development of Portfolio-based Credit Value at Risk / Expected Shortfall ( VaR / ES ) Model
A portfolio-based credit value at risk / expected shortfall ( VaR / ES ) model was envisaged to be developed as an additional risk monitoring / reporting tool .
However , the final modelling and parameterisation would be done post completion of the review of the risk tolerance framework for the concerned business departments .
Development of Stress Testing Framework
The development of a stress testing framework is serving as an additional tool for monitoring , and would be taken up post completion of the review of the risk tolerance framework for the concerned business departments .
ANNUAL REPORT 2020-21
The operational teams of business owner departments and DIT form the first line of defence , viz . , implementation .
CISO plays a major role in the second line of defence which performs a pro-active role in the assessment and overseeing function of information security risk .
The Inspection Department forms the third line of defence , viz . , assurance .
Agenda for 2021-22
For the year , the following goals for the Department have been proposed :
Roll-out of RTLs for other operational areas ( Utkarsh ) ;
Quantificaton of IT and cyber risk ( Utkarsh ) ; and
Review of the risk assessment methodology for operational risk .
The Inspection Department of the Reserve Bank examines , evaluates and reports on internal control and governance processes and provides risk assurance to the top management and the Central Board under risk-based internal audit ( RBIA ) framework .
The Department also monitors the functioning of the concurrent audit ( CA ) system and control self-assessment audit ( CSAA ) in the Reserve Bank .
The RBIA , CA and CSAA functions are performed through an automated system named audit management and risk monitoring system ( AMRMS ) .
The Department acts as secretariat to the Audit and Risk Management Sub-Committee ( ARMS ) of the Central Board and also to the Executive Directors ' Committee ( EDC ) in overseeing the internal audit function .
Agenda for 2020-21 : Implementation Status Goals Set for 2020-21
Last Year , the Department had set out the following goals :
Implementing project audit for all the identified high value IT and non-IT projects of the Reserve Bank ( Utkarsh ) [ Para X । .48 ]
Enhanced convergence with risk-rating as per risk assessment methodology for operational risk ( RAM-OR ) with respect to RBIA ( Utkarsh ) [ Para X1.49 ] ;
Leveraging on AMRMS data mining , analytics and management information system ( MIS ) reporting dashboards capabilities for effective risk assurance to the ARMS and top management ( Utkarsh ) [ Para XI.50 ] ;
Knowledge and capacity building through training programmes ( Utkarsh ) .
Implementation Status of Goals
In pursuit of the goals set for the year , the Department conducted a pilot project audit of an IT project successfully with a view to promote an effective internal control environment for managing the implementation of projects in the Reserve Bank in a timely and cost-effective manner as per the project plan .
GOVERNANCE , HUMAN RESOURCES AND ORGANISATIONAL MANAGEMENT
The primary objective of the project audit is to assess , evaluate and provide an independent , objective assessment regarding execution of the project by evaluating the project plan , nature and extent of responsibilities , authority and accountability of the project management team , use of resources , timely completion and delivery of the project .
The Department has also achieved the targeted convergence of the risk-ratings assessed under RBIA and risk ratings determined as per the RAM-OR during the year .
While the automation of RBIA and CA functionality in AMRMS were achieved during previous year , the Department focused on automation of CSAA functionality and completed the same successfully during the year .
Automation through AMRMS provides facilities like planning and conduct of audit ; uniformity and standardisation in audit reporting ; submission , processing and monitoring of compliances ; data analytics and reporting dashboards on Key Performance Indicators ( KPIs ) , documentation and record management , and alerts in an integrated manner .
This has created synergy among the internal audit operations , risk management and risk assurance functions by bringing in enhanced internal audit efficacy , operational efficiency , confidentiality , spontaneous reporting , paper-less environment ( reduced carbon foot print ) and straight-through- processing ( STP ) .
The Department also endeavoured to enhance knowledge and capacity building by creating awareness among all the users through several trainings / workshops on automation in AMRMS covering all the Central Office departments , regional offices and training establishments of the Reserve Bank .
ANNUAL REPORT 2020-21
The country-wide invocation of BCP for all regional offices / business units was handled with enhanced recourse to technology with dexterity .
The Reserve Bank ' s proactive crisis management initiatives have borne ample dividend by ensuring uninterrupted 24X7 services for the payment system of the country in particular , and the banking system in general .
The Expenditure Rules 2018 were amended to reinforce the internal financial controls under the expenditure framework of the Reserve Bank .
The expenditure rules have also been mapped in bill payment module of e-Kuber to strengthen the financial discipline and improve management information system ( MIS ) .
Agenda for 2020-21 : Implementation Status Goals Set for 2020-21
Last Year , the Department had set out the following goals :
Operationalising a dashboard to implement the key performance indicators-based ( KPIs ) framework for monitoring and assessing the implementation of strategic ) [ Para XI.58 ] ;
GOVERNANCE , HUMAN RESOURCES AND ORGANISATIONAL MANAGEMENT
The Reserve Bank articulated a formal strategic management framework in April 2015 and re-affirmed its core purpose , values and vision statements with a view to delineating its strategic objectives in contemporary terms and providing a framework and backdrop against which its policies could be formulated .
Subsequently , a need was felt to have a medium-term dynamic strategy framework that could capture and respond to the rapidly emerging dynamics of the economic , social and technological ecosystem of the time .
Responding to this need , Utkarsh 2022 , the medium-term strategic framework of the Reserve Bank was launched in July 2019 .
The implementation of Utkarsh 2022 is steered as a medium-term strategy by a high-level Strategy Sub- Committee of the Central Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank , comprising of three Central Board Directors , Deputy Governor and Executive Director-in-Charge of Corporate Strategy and Budget Department ( CSBD ) and CGM , CSBD .
Though the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic posed challenges in achieving the set milestones , 169 out of 226 milestones have been fully implemented as at end-March 2021 , with over a year left for the goal implementation .
Fulfilment of strategic milestones under Utkarsh 2022 and their sustenance are monitored through a Key Performance Indicator ( KPI ) framework .
The KPI framework is useful in capturing early warning signals for potential non- achievement of milestones .
The milestones have further been grouped as input , process , output and outcome milestones to capture all dimensions of the Reserve Bank ' s working and function .
The sudden and rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 , and the resultant country-wide lockdown put to test the resilience of Utkarsh 2022 .
The changes engendered by the lockdown in the modes of operation of most functions of the Reserve Bank , as also the banking
Putting in place a BCM framework for pandemic ; and
While some changes will be short-lived , there will pe many which will permanently alter the way banking services are delivered and used .
The shift to the digital mode of working and the growing competition from FinTech companies bring new challenges and opportunities for the banking system .
Under the guidance of the Strategy Sub-Committee , all departments have reviewed their strategies in the light of COVID-19 pandemic .
Departments have pro-actively monitored the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the banking services and have taken measures to counter disruptions and ensure business continuity , cyber security and uninterrupted operations of the payment system .
The challenges arising out of COVID-19 have also been handled effectively by banks and other financial institutions .
Strategy plays a crucial role in shaping the future of an organisation , while also helping it in fulfilling its core mission and vision .
Even as we are beginning to emerge from the shadows of COVID-19 , the Reserve Bank ' s strategic framework recognises that new threats and opportunities can suddenly materialise .
The Reserve Bank ' s strategic framework therefore strives to be dynamic , evolving and responsive to emerging threats and opportunities .
Since its launch in July 2019 , Utkarsh 2022 has run half its course by March 2021 .
Having survived a global pandemic without the slightest interruption in delivery of banking and payments services across the country is no mean achievement .
The Strategy Sub- Committee , therefore , is set to have a mid-course review of Utkarsh 2022 in 2021 .
The exercise will provide much needed feedback on what worked well and what did not , and provide crucial inputs on where to turn the radar in looking out for the future .
