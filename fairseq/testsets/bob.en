It gives me great pleasure to place before you the highlights of the Bank ' s performance during the financial year 2020-21 ( FY 2021 ) .
FY 2021 was an extraordinary year in many respects .
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic threatened the health and livelihoods , in absence of a cure .
We share the grief of our fellow citizens and employees of the bank who have lost their near and dear ones in this pandemic .
| admire with a sense of pride the role played by bank employees in giving services to people during these difficult times .
Countries all over the world imposed lockdowns while health infrastructure and systems were being ramped up .
Contact intensive services suffered the most .
Consumers had to spend more time at home than outside .
Globally , central banks reduced interest rates led by US Federal Reserve and conducted asset purchase programmes to inject liquidity .
Government of India announced economic measures ranging from cash transfers to allocation of food grains to marginal households , increase in rural employment spends , higher capital investments and credit guarantee scheme for MSMESs and sectors most impacted by the pandemic .
Overall ₹ 15.7 lakh crore support was provided by RBI amounting to 8 % of GDP. It also advised banks to offer moratorium to customers impacted by the pandemic .
RBI also allowed banks to restructure loans to MSME and retail customers who have been impacted by the pandemic .
The number of infections also started falling after the peak reached in September .
The measures announced by the Government and RBI and the opening up of the economy led to growth recovery from October 2020 onwards .
Scientists all over the world developed vaccines which proved quite effective against COVID-19 .
India was one of the few countries able to discover an indigenous vaccine .
During these challenging times , banking services have been operational and have played a key role in implementing various economic measures announced by Government of India and RBI .
Bank of Baroda was instrumental in offering moratorium and restructuring to customers impacted by the pandemic .
The Bank also extended credit lines to customers under sovereign credit linked guarantee .
The need for digitally delivering banking services has never been felt as much as during the current times .
Bank of Baroda has been digitising its operations and services as part of enhancing customer experience .
For instance , a large proportion of deposit accounts opened by branches are in paperless format .
Given the ubiquity of a mobile handset and mobile application , mobile banking is now the centrepiece for offering digital solutions to our customers .
The Bank has now extended its digital offering on the asset side as well by building a digital lending platform wherein end-to-end customer journey from sourcing to sanction to disbursement is being completely digitised .
This will enable us to compete in the marketplace and offer superior products and services to our customers .
Government of India has been ranking Public Sector Banks on the EASE 2.0 parameters across six themes namely ' Responsible Banking ' , ' Governance and HR ' , ' PSBs as Udyamimitra for MSMESs , " ' Credit off-take ' , ' Financial Inclusion and Digitisation ' and ' Customer Responsiveness ' .
Notably , in EASE 1.0 we were ranked " Second . "
The transformation effort at the Bank is showing results and I thank all our stakeholders , especially employees , for helping us achieve this .
During FY 2021 , the Bank ' s financial performance was resilient amidst the challenges .
The asset quality has improved with GNPA ratio trending down to 8.87 % from 9.40 % in the previous year .
The credit growth in select segments such as housing , auto and agriculture was above industry during the year .
Bank ' s domestic CASA deposits increased by 16.48 % as on March 31 , 2021 and CASA ratio increased to 42.87 % , an increase of 380 bps over March 2020 .
The Bank has also optimised its branch network after amalgamation .
Branches and ATMs which were in close proximity to each other have been brought together under one roof thus reaping synergies from the merger .
Bank moved to lower tax structure under the new regime of Income Tax Act .
Still , the Bank reported profit after tax of 829 crore as against 546 crore in FY 2020 .
The Bank also raised additional funds through AT-1 bond issuances of ₹ 3,735 crore .
The Bank of the future will have the right mix of physical and digital presence .
Bank has introduced a new initiattve " BOB NOWW - New Operating model and Ways of Working . "
The initiative is aimed at rightsizing our branch network by increasing customer touch points through digital formats and business correspondent network .
Customer interface for lending will be more digital .
The focus is on capturing the entire corporate value chain by cross-selling banking services such as cash management solution and supply chain finance .
For the employees , the work environment will be more flexible with option to work from anywhere for select roles .
As the economic recovery was gaining ground , the world and India have been gripped by a second wave .
A number of Indian states had to announce local containment measures to curtail the spread of the pandemic .
RBI has already announced Resolution Framework 2.0 for MSMESs , small businesses and individuals impacted by the second wave .
While the second wave will impact growth prospects in the short-term , India ' s long-term growth trajectory remains intact .
Government has announced a series of reforms and economic measures such as privatisation policy , thrust on digitisation and production linked incentives for a number of growth sectors .
I am pleased to be part of this journey .
Initially , the only way to contain the virus was social distancing .
Thus governments had to institute lockdowns to restrict movement .
However , within a year scientists have developed vaccines to fight the virus .
The initial results from countries which have been able to vaccinate a larger percentage of population are encouraging .
Banking is an essential service and was operational throughout the year .
Our branches uninterruptedly functioned even during the lockdown and the most severe months of the pandemic .
The Bank was instrumental in implementing Governments and RBI ' s relief measures to support the economy be it through cash transfers , restructuring or lending to MSME borrowers against sovereign credit guarantee .
Our employees showed exceptional courage and served our customers .
We gratefully acknowledge the sacrifices made by our staff members who have been the pillars of strength for our Bank in these trying times .
The Bank took several measures to safeguard the health and well-being of its employees and their family members including conducting vaccination drives .
Despite these challenges , the Bank ' s performance has been resilient in terms of asset quality , deposit franchise , credit growth , profitability and capital .
The Bank ' s investments in offering digital solutions to customers helped it to serve customers digitally .
The Bank ' s mobile application has become the centrepiece for offering banking services .
Liabilities customers are on-boarded digitally and the Bank is investing in platforms to digitally sanction and disburse loans .
The highlights from the past year are summarised below .
Encouragingly , domestic corporate credit cycle seems to be turning because of which domestic credit cost has fallen to 1.54 % during FY 2021 from 2.51 % in the previous financial year .
The Bank ' s overall provision coverage ratio ( including technical write-offs ) is stable at 81.80 % as on March 31 , 2021 .
Within CASA deposits , the Bank ' s current account deposits increased by 24.09 % and savings deposits by 15.06 % .
This has been achieved on the back of digital on boarding of customers , roll-out of Bank ' s state-of-the- art cash management solution and partnerships such as the one with Ministry of Corporate Affairs ( MCA ) .
The Bank ' s domestic credit off-take was in line with industry growth of 5 % in FY 2021 .
While corporate borrowers moved to bond markets to meet their funding requirements , the Bank was able to grow its MSME , retail and agriculture portfolio in double digits .
MSME portfolio increased bolstered by the governments sovereign guarantee .
Agriculture segment was catapulted by a 32.64 % increase in gold loans .
Retail loan portfolio saw a broad based increase in both secured and unsecured loans .
For instance , our auto and personal loan book increased by 27.79 % and 27.21 % respectively in FY 2021 .
This was made possible by exercising strict control over cost overheads .
As a result , Bank ' s profit before tax increased to ₹ 5,556 crore as against a loss of ₹ 1,802 crore in FY 2020 .
The Bank also moved to a lower tax rate structure .
Despite reversal of Deferred Tax Asset ( DTA ) , the Bank posted profit after tax of ₹ 829 crore in FY 2021 as against ₹ 546 crore in FY 2020 .
Adjusting for the one-time impact of DTA , Bank ' s profit after tax would have been at 4,143 crore .
The Bank ' s capital adequacy ratio ( CRAR ) increased to of ₹ 4,143 crore , fresh equity raise of 4,500 crore and AT-1 bonds of ₹ 3,735 crore .
As a result , Bank ' s CET-I ratio on a standalone basis rose to 10.94 % as of March 31 , 2021 as against 9.44 % as on March 31 , 2020 .
In order to build on the last year ' s achievements , the Bank has designed a new pathway for a profitable and sustainable growth under a Bank-wide transformation programme called BOB-NOWW .
This envisages transforming the Bank for the future .
At its core , the aim is to better serve every customer with tailored offerings and to enhance customer centricity .
Employees will get remote working options for certain roles and hybrid employment formats .
The initiatives being undertaken aim to help the Bank optimise costs and unlock growth potential by creating value for all stakeholders .
Bank ' s mobile application will be the primary interface with customers .
Apart from a few services which are best delivered at a branch , we believe customers will increasingly be using mobile phones for meeting banking requirements .
Bank has revamped its mobile application and added services so that customers don ' t have to visit the branch unless essential .
This will help the customers to migrate to digital and mobile channels .
Even at the branch , the focus will be to nudge customers to digitally process their requests .
The Bank is digitising customer journeys in the lending business .
The endeavour is end-to-end digitisation of the loan process in retail and MSME segments from sourcing to sanction to disbursement .
Small ticket personal loans have already been digitised and the other segments will be progressively moved to this platform .
The Bank completed the integration with erstwhile Dena and erstwhile Vijaya Bank .
As part of the integration , the Bank has merged or rationalised 1,310 branches and 1,135 ATMs during the year .
At the same time , the Bank has increased its Business Correspondent ( BC ) Bank has a market share of 16.24 % in PMJDY deposits .
Inthe next 2 years , the Bank plans to have 50,000 touch points - including BCs and new formats ( mini branches and service outlets ) .
These touch points would be new- age , compact and digital to offer seamless customer service across the country .
This will help the Bank in strengthening its branch network in geographies where it is under-penetrated .
For instance , the Bank can grow its corporate business wallet share by offering full-service solutions , with initiatives to holistically understand customer needs and offer the entire gamut of financial products .
The wealth management business too has immense potential within the Bank given the large base of MSME and high net worth clients .
The Bank is overhauling its wealth business to enhance its value proposition .
The work environment wentthrough asea change during the pandemic .
Employees were able to seamlessly work from home and office .
The Bank believes that " Work from Anywhere " is the new norm and will offer a better work-life balance to employees and boost productivity in the long run .
The Bank is working on an operating model for remote working options for certain roles and hybrid employment formats which will offer greater flexibility to employees .
The impact of the transformation initiatives underway are visible with the Bank emerging at " First " position under the Government of India ' s EASE 2.0 rankings .
In the previous year , Bank was ranked at " Second " position under EASE 1.0 .
These trends will be further strengthened under BOB-NOWW as the Bank is on a digital journey with enhanced customer centricity .
I would like to acknowledge and thank the Chairman of the Board , Dr. Hasmukh Adhia and all the members of the Board for their valuable support , guidance and inputs to the management in our endeavours .

The world went through an unprecedented health crisis in the form of a pandemic in 2020 .
Almost all global economies announced a lockdown starting in early 2020 .
This resulted in a contraction in global GDP by 3.3 % in 2020 ( Source : IMF ) .
The global contraction was led by Advanced Economies ( AEs ) where GDP contracted by 4.7 % .
Within AEs , the highest decline was seen in UK at 9.9 % followed by Euro Area at 6.6 % and US at 3.5 % .
All AEs announced fiscal and monetary stimulus to support growth .
As a result , fiscal deficit in US is estimated to have increased to 14.9 % of GDP in 2020 from 4.6 % of GDP in 2019 .
UK and Euro Area too followed expansionary fiscal policies .
Expansionary fiscal policy went hand-in-hand with monetary accommodation which included reduction in interest rates , asset purchase programmes and provision of liquidity to different segments of the economy to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic .
GDP of Emerging and Developing Economies is estimated to have contracted by 2.2 % led by Latin America with a decline of 7 % in 2020 .
Asia seems to have been relatively better placed with Emerging and Developing Asian economies reporting a decline of 1 % in 2020 .
The decline in global GDP led to 8.5 % reduction in world trade volumes in 2020 as restrictions disrupted supply chains .
Global commodity prices also fell sharply in 2020 led by oil .
However , the underlying economic situation seems to have changed dramatically with availability of vaccines and gradual opening of lockdown restrictions .
The monetary and fiscal stimulus given by governments and central banks seems to have led to resurgence in demand , in particular for goods .
While AEs are expected to grow by 5.1 % in 2021 , Emerging and Developing Economies are estimated to grow by 6.7 % .
Within AEs , growth is driven by US at 6.4 % followed by Euro Area at 4.4 % .
Within Emerging economies , Asian economies are slated to grow by 8.6 % followed by Latin America at 4.6 % .
The sudden rebound in world demand led to sharp increase in global commodity prices and long-term growth outlook .
Global growth even in 2022 is estimated to maintain above average momentum at 4.4 % .
In-line with the decline seen in the world economy , India ' s GDP is estimated to have contracted by 7.3 % in FY 2021 following a 4.0 % increase in FY 2020 .
The contraction is a result of nationwide lockdown imposed atthe beginning of the financial year to control the spread of COVID-19 pandemic .
The decline is led by 10.8 % drop in investment demand from an increase of 5.4 % in FY 2020 .
Even consumption is expected to have fallen by 9.1 % after reporting an increase of 5.5 % in FY 2020 .
The disruption to the Indian and global economy resulted in India ' s industrial production falling by 8.7 % during FY 2021 .
Manufacturing and mining sector declined sharply by 9.8 % and 7.8 % respectively .
Electricity output reported a much better picture with a decline of only 0.5 % during FY 2021 .
The lockdowns and restrictions have impacted the services sector as well .
Services sector is estimated to report a decline of more than 8 % in FY 2021 .
The maximum impact has been felt in contact intensive services such as travel , tourism and education .
In order to mitigate the impact of the pandemic , the Government presented a pro-growth Budget with a large outlay on capital spending .
The Central Government not only made direct cash transfers to the marginal households , but also increased outlay on food subsidies and employment programmes .
This led to increase in fiscal deficit to 9.3 % of GDP in FY 2021 from 4.6 % of GDP in FY 2020 .
The restrictions imposed to contain the pandemic resulted in disruptions in both demand and supply side .
As a result , retail inflation edged up to 6.2 % in FY 2021 from 4.8 % in FY 2020 .
The increase in inflation was led by higher food prices .
Food inflation increased by 9.8 % in the first half of the financial year compared with only 5.8 % increase seen in second half of the financial year .
Even non-food inflation or core inflation increased on the back of higher retail fuel prices .
However , COVID-19 infections increased towards the end of FY 2020 .
Instead of a national lockdown , state governments have imposed local lockdowns to contain the spread of the virus .
The same has led to a decline in economic momentum seen towards the end of last financial year .
RBI has revised its growth forecast to 9.5 % in FY 2022 .
With global economy reviving , demand for India ' s software services and merchandise goods is likely to do well .
Credit growth of Scheduled Commercial Banks ( SCBs ) declined to 5.6 % as of March 2021 from 6.1 % as of March 2020 .
The economic impact of the pandemic explains the muted credit off-take .
With agriculture sector remaining relatively free of any disruption , credit off-take to agriculture increased by 12.3 % as of March 2021 .
On the other hand , credit off-take to industry remained muted .
Within this , credit off-take to medium industry reported an increase of 28.8 % as of March 2021 .
This can be explained by credit guarantee given by Government of India for incremental lending to MSMESs to tide over the economic impact of the pandemic .
Credit off-take to services sector and consumer sector too saw a decline in momentum .
While consumer loans did increase by 10.2 % as of March 2021 , the growth was lower than last year when this segment witnessed an increase of 15 % .
Relatively muted demand for bank credit is also attributable to corporate institutions tapping the bond market to meet the need for their funds .
In fact , in FY 2021 , corporate institutions including financial institutions were able to raise 7.7 lakh crore from bond market compared with 6.7 lakh crore in FY 2020 .
The reverse repo rate was reduced by an even sharper 155bps .
RBI also injected liquidity in the form of targeted long term repurchase operations ( TLTROSs ) , open market operations ( OMOs ) and reduction in cash reserve ratio ( CRR ) .
It also provided credit lines to banks to on-lend to National Housing Bank ( NHB ) , National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development ( NABARD ) , etc .
In Government of India ' s EASE 2.0 index , Bank secured the " First " position among all Public Sector Banks .
As per the index , significant progress is seen in the Bank across six themes ' Responsible Banking ' , ' Governance and HR ' , ' PSBs as Udyamimitra for MSMESs ' , ' Credit off-take ' , ' Financial Inclusion and Digitisation ' and ' Customer Responsiveness ' .
