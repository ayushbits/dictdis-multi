5 . Cardiovascular System
Cardiovascular system is the transport system of the body , through which the nutrients are conveyed to places where these are utilized , and the metabolites ( waste products ) are conveyed to appropriate places from where these are expelled .
The conveying medium is a liquid tissue , the bhlood , which flows in tubular channels called bÄªood vessels .
The circulation is maintained by the central pumping organ called the heart .
COMPONENTS
Cardiovascular system is a closed system of tubes made up of the following parts based on their structural and topographical characteristics ( Fig . 5.1 ) .
1 . Heart : Itisa four-chambered muscular organ which pumps blood to various parts of the body .
Each half of the heart has a receiving chamber called atrium , and a pumping chamber called ventricle .
2 . Arteries : These are distributing channels which carry blood away from the heart .
( a ) They branch like trees on their way to different parts of the body .
( b ) The large arteries are rich in elastic tissue , but as branching progresses there is an ever-increasing amount of smooth muscle in lheir walls .
( c ) The minute branches which are just visible to naked eye are called arterioles .
( d ) Angeion is a Greek word , meaning a vessel ( blood vessel or Iymph vessel )
Its word derivatives are angiology , angiography , haemangioma , and thromboangitis obliterans .
3 . Veins : These are draining channels which carry blood from different parts of the body back to the heart .
( a ) Like rivers , the veins are formed by tributaries .
( b ) The small veins ( venules ) join togeiher to form larger veins , which in turn unite to form great veins called venae cavae ( Fig . 5.2 ) .
Capillaries : These are networks of microscopic vessels which Conrecl arlerioles wilh lhe venules .
- These come in intimate contact with the tissues for a free exchange of nutrients and rnetabolites across their walls between the blood and the tissue fluid .
- The metabalites are partly drained by the capillaries and partly by lyvmphatics .
- Capillaries are replaced by sinusoids in certain organs , like liver and spleen .
Functionally , the blood vessels can be classified into the following five groups .
( a ) Distribauting vessels , including arteries ;
( b ) Resistance vessels , including arterioles and precapillary sphincters ;
( c ) Exchange vessels , including capillaries , sinusoids , and postcapillary venules ;
( d ) Reservoir ( capacitance ) vessels , including larger venules and veins ; and
( e ) Sunts , including various types of anastomoses .
Types of Circulation of Blood
Systemic ( greater ) circulation : The blood fiows from the left ventricle , through various parts of the body , to the right atrium , i.e. from the left to the right side of the heart ( Fig . 5.3 ) .
Pulmonary ( lesser ) circulation : The blood flows from the right ventricle , through the lungs , to the lef atrium. i.e. from the right to the left side of the heart .
Portal circulation It is a part of systemic circulation , which has the following characteristics .
( a ) The blood passes through two sets of capillaries before draining into a systemic vein .
( b ) The vein draining the first capillary network is known as portal vein which branchcs like an artery to form the second set of capillaries or sinusoids .
Examples : hepatic portal circulation hypothalamo hypophyseal portal circulation and renal portal circulation ( Fig . 5.3 ) .
Arteries
Characteristic Features
1 . Arteries are thick-walled. being uniformly thicker than the accompanying veins , except for the arteries within the cranium and vertebral canal where these are thin .
2 . Their lumen is smaller than that of the accompanying veins .
3 . Arteries have no valves .
4 . An artery is usually accompanied by vein ( s ) and nerve ( s ) , and the three of them together form the neurovascular bundle which is surrounded and supported by a fibroareolar sheath .
